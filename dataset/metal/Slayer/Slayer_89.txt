[Verse 1]
I never thought the taste of you
Would be the only thing to make me bleed
Why am I so alive
While you lay still in the ground beneath me?
Fear of death, the dark inside
Have become your only children
They're in front of you, watching you
Lost screams, unholy dreams, unrest
I laugh at your God as he's passing through
Slicing at your throat to warm my skin
Never thought it'd come to this
What the fuck? I've gone wrong, no rest
Your children still call
Can't you hear them screaming out your name?
You've gone insane
They're in my head
They want you to
[Chorus]
Die in front of me
Die in front of me
Thinking, "Why me?"
Wishing this was all a dream
Insanity, reality
You're going to die in front of me
[Post-Chorus 1]
Pestilence is here
Death awaits
Your body's not of Christ
It's my altar
Helpless and alone
Violate
Enveloped in my sin
Faceless canvass
Tearing at your flesh
Bathed in blood
Violently regress
Death's so endless
Brutal is your pain
Anguish is the game
Broken and afraid
God can't help you now
[Bridge]
You'll wish you were in hell
You'll wish you were in hell
You'll wish you were in hell
[Verse 2]
Ghostly figures are always standing still
Are they mocking me?
What do they see?
I didn't want your death to end so fast
But once you start, you cannot stop
I need it now to fucking last
[Chorus]
Die in front of me
Die in front of me
Thinking, "Why me?"
Wishing this was all a dream
Insanity, reality
You're going to die in front of me
[Post-Chorus 2]
Pestilence is here
Death awaits
Your body's not of Christ
It's my altar
Brutal is your pain
Anguish is the game
Broken and afraid
God can't help you now
[Lead â€“ Hanneman]
[Bridge]
You'll wish you were in hell
You'll wish you were in hell
You'll wish you were in hell
You'll wish you were in hell
[Verse 3]
I never thought the taste of you
Would be the only thing to make me bleed
All alone in my funeral home
Playing in blood, there's just got to be
Something wrong with me
Draining veins, it's all the same
The torture in my head, it won't stop
Until I am fucking dead
[Post-Chorus 1]
Pestilence is here
Death awaits
Your body's not of Christ
It's my altar
Helpless and alone
Violate
Enveloped in my sin
Faceless canvass
Tearing at your flesh
Bathed in blood
Violently regress
Death's so endless
Brutal is your pain
Anguish is the game
Broken and afraid
God can't help you now
[Outro]
You'll wish you were in hell
You'll wish you were in hell
You'll wish you were in hell
