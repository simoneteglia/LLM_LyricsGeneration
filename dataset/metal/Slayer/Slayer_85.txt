[Verse 1: Rustage & Divide]
Feeling the heat
I'm lighting up, no time for defeat
See you retreat
Powers increased
I will not stop till the missions complete
I will not fail
All my friends around me are the winds in my sail
Ain't no challenge stopp
ing
us, I'm sure we'll prevail
Conquer any enemy, better be blazing trails
Remember the name, we're the Fairy Tail
I can explode like a cannon, ay
Cause I was raised by a dragon, ay
Sharper than Erza's blade, my flames will burn insane
I can do more than imagine, ay
Bout to hear my roar
Bodies on the floor, hitting people with my claws
Cannot be ignored
Endless limits, I'm entering Dragon Force
Kill it
Knowing that I own this
Exploding with crimson lotus
I hone this, you're taking notice
I show this, I'm hyper focused
I'm the G.O.A.T. It's unbelievable
My passions inconceivable
Heating up the track cus I'm back
You can't slow this
Down
Kidnapping Lucy, and I'll make you pay
Trapping you here so you're frozen like gray
What can I say
Now I'm unstoppable, nothing's impossible
Blow you away
[Chorus: Divide &
Rustage
]
Take a breath, I'm coming in prepared
When I harness my flames
Knocking you back cause my power's insane
Take a step
And I'm almost there
I will not be restrained
Breaking these chains and I'm back in the game
I feel the fire
It's burning up all inside of me
I'll never tire
I'm working more than I'll ever be
Yeah
So come at me if you dare
I am the dragon slayer
[Break: Divide]
Woah
I am the dragon slayer
Woah
I am the dragon slayer
[Verse 2: Zach Boucher & Divide]
Got a fire in my gut
And I can never have enough
(Have enough)
A dragon slayer from inside of me
They don't get though, I'm nuts
(I'm nuts)
I put in the love for the ones that I care about and that I trust
I got my buddies they backing me up
And we ain't leaving anyone in the dust
So I'll be your shield as long as you're close
Even when I have a limit, I don't
See the guild is always there for me most
Only when I'm with the others, I'm home
But this is the better me
I'm giving everything
Showing a side of me that you have never seen
Won't let em speak on what they say I'll never be
I'll be the savior and that is forever me
[Chorus: Divide &
Rustage
]
Take a breath, I'm coming in prepared
When I harness my flames
Knocking you back cause my power's insane
Take a step
And I'm almost there
I will not be restrained
Breaking these chains and I'm back in the game
I feel the fire
It's burning up all inside of me
I'll never tire
I'm working more than I'll ever be
Yeah
So come at me if you dare
I am the dragon slayer
[Break: Divide]
Woah
I am the dragon slayer
Woah
I am the dragon slayer
I am the dragon slayer
