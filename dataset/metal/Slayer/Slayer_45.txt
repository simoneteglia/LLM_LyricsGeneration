[Giles]
I've got a theory
That it's a demon
A dancing demon!
No, something isn't right there
[Willow]
I've got a theory
Some kid is dreaming
And we're all stuck inside his wacky Broadway nightmare
[Xander]
I've got a theory
We should work this out
[Anya, Tara, Willow and Xander]
It's getting eerie
What's this cheery singing all about?
[Xander]
It could be witches!
Some evil witches!
Which is ridiculous
Cause witches they were persecuted
And Wicca good and love the earth and woman power
And I'll be over here
[Anya]
I've got a theory!
It could be bunnies!
[Tara]
I've got a—
[Anya]
Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes!
They've got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses!
And what's with all the carrots?
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway?
Bunnies!
Bunnies!
It must be bunnies!
...Or maybe midgets
[Willow]
I've got a theory we should work this fast—
[Willow and Giles]
Because it clearly could get serious before it's passed
[Buffy]
I've got a theory
It doesn't matter...
What can't we face if we're together?
What's in this place that we can't weather?
Apocalypse?
We've all been there
The same old trips
Why should we care?
[Buffy, Anya, Giles, Tara, Willow and Xander]
What can't we do if we get in it?
We'll work it through within a minute
We have to try
We'll pay the price
It's do or die
[Buffy]
Hey, I've died twice
[Buffy, Anya, Tara, Willow and Xander]
What can't we face if we're together?
[Giles]
What can't we face?
[Buffy, Anya, Tara, Willow and Xander]
What's in this place we can't weather?
[Giles]
If we're together...
[Buffy, Anya, Tara, Willow and Xander]
There's nothing we can't face
[Anya]
...Except for bunnies
