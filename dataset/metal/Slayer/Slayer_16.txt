[Intro: Mellowthemanic]
強くなれる理由を知った 僕を連れて進め
どうしたって
[Verse: Khantrast]
Came up from the bottom
Better move with caution
Water breathing style final form
Imma slay
When I pull up, get thunderclapped
My slayers run it back
Make sure these demons
Remember the name
I do 'em dirty like Giyu, when I'm dead calm
Just like
Yahaba
, I see through all ya dead plots
Slump like a god Zenitsu cut ya head off
Pull with ya demons, I'm making sure all they necks gone
Built like a Pillar,
my lungs is breathing with no breath loss
Dead wrong, dead wrong
Thinking that's my best shot
Flower god, flower god
Hinokami Kagura
Upper Moon, Lower moon
Slay' em like a Hashira
Whirlpool flow cuz I drown in drip
Flash dance
leave ya mans in a drought eclipse
Talk shit, see ya innards coming out from in
Side ya mouth,
Susamaru
, going out a bitch
I pull up with my slayers on a power trip
Ya come back? Make sure you going down again
Get thunder clapped like a demon slayer alchemist
Protect the sis, so they don't ever doubt the kid
[Hook: FabvL]
Left alone
To set her free
Falling down
I keep on falling now
Run to cure
My memory
All alone
On my own
On my own
Beat these demons
In my mind, true
Family never hurts the other side, you
Always had my back
Won’t let you drift away
You’ll be ok
[Interlude: Khantrast]
Gotta keep my head in the moment
Total concentration Imma keep my focus
It's my time, fighting for the longest
Gotta bring the sis back from her lowest
Gotta keep my head all in the moment
Total concentration Imma keep my focus
This my life, Imma keep going
Fight back, bite back
Fight back, like that
[Outro/Guitar Solo]
