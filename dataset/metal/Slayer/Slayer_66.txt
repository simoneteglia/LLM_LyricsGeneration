[Verse 1]
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all
[Chorus]
Stab! Fight!
The hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Fight!
I know what I am: I'm Berlin
[Verse 2]
Cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall
[Chorus]
Stab! Fight!
The hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Fight!
I know what I am: I'm Berlin
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Verse 3]
Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath
[Chorus]
Stab! Fight!
The hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Fight!
I know what I am: I'm Berlin
