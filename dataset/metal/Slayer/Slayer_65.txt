[Verse 1]
Cascaded darkness, walls close in on me
Nailed shut, but my eyes still see
Severe anguish as my body evolves
The pain of life after death, it resolves
[Lead: Kerry King]
[Verse 2]
Emptiness in twilight's rebirth
The faint sounds of shoveled earth
Madness growing as your mind dissolves
Merely secret in my dreams
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Pre-Chorus]
Night grows cold, twilight's near
On the edge of madness, the wounds are sheared
Forms of hanging, flesh-shredded carcass
No spared breath
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
Dead soul
Stone cold
Out into the night
[Chorus]
Voices inside my head
Hold me under
Voices oppress
Like roaring thunder
An echo bouncing inside my brain
How much can I take of the pain?
The pain!
[Post-Chorus]
A war raging deep inside my head
A split decision that will end with me dead
You see the agony in my eyes
Protruding aimless
I think it's time to...
Die
[Segue]
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 3]
A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
That burns in your head
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Verse 4]
Intense pain eats away at your brain
Thorazine pumping through your veins
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 5]
Death walks inside you
Smell death around you
Hell's evil spell takes a soul
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 6]
Laughing as you eternally rot
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Outro]
Live undead
Dead
