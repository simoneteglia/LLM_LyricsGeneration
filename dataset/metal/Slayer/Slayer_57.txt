[TARA]
I'm under your spell
God, how can this be?
Playing with my memory
You know I've been through hell
Willow, don't you see?
There'll be nothing left of me
You made me believe
[GILES]
Believe me, I don't wanna go
[GILES & TARA]
And it'll grieve me, cuz I love you so
But we both know
[GILES]
Wish I could say
The right words
To lead you through this land
Wish I could play the father
And take you by the hand
[TARA]
Wish I could trust just that it was just this once
But I must do what I must
I can't adjust to this disgust
We're done and I just
[GILES & TARA]
Wish I could stay
Wish I could stay
Wish I could stay
Wish I could stay
