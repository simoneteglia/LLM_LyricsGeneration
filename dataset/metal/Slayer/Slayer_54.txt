[Tanjiro Kamado: None Like Joshua]
I can smell the blood, ain’t no telling who to cut
When these demons keeping secrets, decieving amongst us
Like my Nezuko, couldn’t let her go
But I’ll behead a foe and split em like a centerfold
Just to make her better though
Now you hear the water flow
No, it’s not the drip, it’s the river chopping off your dome
Urokodaki taught me a boulder isn’t the hardest stone
So your blood demon art is not impossible
I see the opening thread for the fatal blow
Now you don’t know where’s ahead as it lays below
Shedding your soul to the dead, but I pray you know
Solace instead of the craving for flesh just to make you grow
If you’re Kizuki, I’ll bury ya, tell me where’s Kibutsuji
Making you smell the wisteria, I’ll put you on Mt. Fuji
Running around in hysteria when the demon will beat tsuzumi drums
I only smell the scent of your cruelty

[Zenitsu Agatsuma: Rustage]
Don’t know why I’m here, I’m frantic and can’t think straight
Trembling in fear, I panic, I make mistakes
It takes courage, I never seem to be brave enough
Demons need slaying? Ask Tanjiro, I’m not up to snuff
Are you crazy, you’re saying that there’s a demon here?
I can sense his movements with my ear, that’s what I can hear
Now I’m getting stressed out, coming to the last round
It’s all overwhelming, I can’t take it, Imma pass out
Hitting quicker than lightning
I’m striking, slicing the heads off
A
raijin
, fighting my way and I’m rising
Not hiding or frightened, have no fear of dying
Trying to become free
Can’t escape me when I’m coming with the godspeed
Faster than a shutter, I cut her and then I gut her
Rebut her, another stunner
Leave you in the gutter, on attack
I can see you stutter, now you’re just another sucker
Who’s unfortunately discovered my raw power, the thunderclap

[Inosuke Hashibira: GameboyJones]
I’m an animal let loose out the cage
And I don’t care who you are, we can run the fade
Better bring your blade, I don’t care if you’re a demon
All I know is that somebody’s gonna leave here bleeding
Head chopped off, watch it roll to the ground
Bet nobody here really wants smoke with me now
Ain’t no holding me down 'cause I still want more dead
Coming through slashing after putting on my boar's head
Better respect me
I work hard, no time for resting
Give me your neck, please
Chop your head off 'cause these demons won’t best me
I can go rounds on the cold ground wrestling
Charge in head first, I don’t ask no questions
Put you to a halt, you a little salt
When I run into battle screaming out
"pig assault"
