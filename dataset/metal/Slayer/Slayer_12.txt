Diamonds on me and they shine like the sun
Goin' straight to the top, bitch, I need number one
I—I hit an opp with the blicky
Yes, I got the sticky, don't call it a gun
Ten tryna pin me, I go on the run
They tryna talk at all, not tryna talk at all
I hit the gas and it fuck up my lungs
Man, what you talkin' 'bout? What he talkin' about?
He play with gang and that nigga is done
I said the beat is so magical, I feel like Bandicoot
These niggas really ain’t none
"How much you spend?" Like a band or two
I'm in a Bentley coupe, never worry about my funds
She ate my dick like an edible, she say I'm edible
I ball hard just like the
Sun
Play with the gang and I'm done with you
Bitch, I went up and now these bitches just like to suck
