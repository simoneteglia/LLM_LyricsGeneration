[Verse 1]
Endure the pain
You know my name
I am your soul insane
I am no one
No one who cares
I am your soul despair
[Verse 2]
Your fear deceives
Vulnerability
Leaving an easy prey
Consume your mind
A power so divine
Will take and rape you blind
[Chorus]
Gemini, master of demise
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine
My lord is my light
The master of darkness
Your death is my salvation
To a kingdom mine
[Verse 3]
You look at me with eyes of fate
And see the graphic truth
Your ignorance cannot shield you
From your naked abuse
Numbing of your moral sense
Facing reality
That life is unconditional
And death is only the beginning
[Refrain]
The pain will never end...
[Guitar Solo: King, Hanneman]
[Bridge]
Walking slow, breathing heavy
You could see death sweat
How it shined an argument
Out of control in my mind
I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Walking slow, breathing heavy
You can see death sweat
[Outro]
I am here for the sole purpose of your death
Look into my eyes
And see the revelations of your demise
Feel the pain that stabs
At the center of your heart, your heart
Reflections of my soul
Reflections of the dark
