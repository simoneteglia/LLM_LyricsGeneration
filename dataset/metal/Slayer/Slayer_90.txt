[Verse 1]
Metal and men clash once more to the end
Warriors above, with the power to kill, descend
Militia of blood, troops of hate march to die
Soldiers of Hell, veterans of death arise
[Chorus]
Prepare for attack
Your body will burn
Endless war
There's no return
Prepare for attack
Death will arrive
Your orders are clear
No way to hide
Fight till death
[Verse 2]
Senseless death of all mankind overtakes
Armored assassins destroy, at will, your escape
Children of sorrow are trampled into the grave
There is no future, no fucking world to be saved
[Chorus]
Prepare for attack
Your body will burn
Endless war
There's no return
Prepare for attack
Death will arrive
Your orders are clear
No way to hide
Fight till death
[Bridge]
To reign in Hell
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 3]
Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man
Reign of death, what is the final command?
Scepters of hate are dropped upon this Earth
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth
[Chorus]
Prepare for attack
Your body will burn
Endless war
There's no return
Prepare for attack
Death will arrive
Your orders are clear
No way to hide
Fight till death
[Outro]
Fight till death
Fight till death
Fight till death
