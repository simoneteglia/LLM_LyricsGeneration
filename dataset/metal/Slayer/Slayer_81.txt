[Verse 1]
Ancient crown placed on your head
The hangman of Prague
Seven keys to the chamber
Surrendered to the God
[Chorus]
Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and bleed some more
[Chorus]
Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and spill some more
[Verse 2]
Golden door submits secrets
As this nation falls
Atmosphere of deadly terror
Subservient to all
[Chorus]
Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and bleed some more
[Chorus]
Hunting
Fighting
Killing whore
Wade through blood and spill some more
[Verse 3]
Burning sense of mission
Assassination
Symbol of oppression
[Verse 4]
Crusade from exile
Obliteration
Sabotaged campaign
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 5]
Czech resistance from afar
Planning the death of one
When the plot is executed
There will be nowhere to run
Ramifications will be high
A price paid in torment
The end justifies the means
To hell you will be sent
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 6]
The wolf leader now is the stalked
Expansion state of horror
Guns echo over the grave
A thousand fates are sealed
Murderous power brought to an end
Only to rise again
Cold and ruthless and iron will
Protectorate of the dead
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Verse 7]
A thorough sweep prelude to death
Secrets kept but no one left
Firing squad begins their work
Harsh reprisal for what you took
Retribution selective terror
The stench of death is everywhere
A severed head, a floating mass
Will give me the answers to what I ask
