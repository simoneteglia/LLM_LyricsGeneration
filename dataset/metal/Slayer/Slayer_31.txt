[Verse 1]
Driving compulsion morbid thoughts come to mind
Sexual release buried deep inside
Complete control of a prized possession
To touch and fondle with no objection
Lonely souls an emptiness fulfilled
Physical pleasure and addictive thrill
An object of perverted reality
An obsession beyond your wildest dreams
[Chorus]
Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die
[Verse 2]
The excitement of dissection is sweet
My skin crawls with orgasmic speed
A lifeless object for my subjection
An obsession beyond your imagination
Primitive instinct a passion for flesh
Primal feeding on the multitudes of death
Sadistic acts a love so true
Absorbingly masticating a part of you
[Chorus]
Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die
[Bridge]
I need a friend
Please be my companion
I don't want to be
Left alone with my sanity
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 3]
Erotic sensations tingle my spine
A dead body lying next to mine
Smooth blue black lips
I start salivating as we kiss
Is mine forever this sweet death
I cannot forget your soft breaths
Panting excitedly with my hands around your neck
[Outro]
Shades are drawn
No one can see
What I've done
What's become of me
Here I stand
Above all that's been true
How I love
How I love to kill you
