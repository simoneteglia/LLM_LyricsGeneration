Life's a show
And we all play our parts
And when the music starts
We open up our hearts
It's all right
If some things come out wrong
We'll sing a happy song
And you can sing along
Where's there's life
There's hope, everyday's a gift
Wishes can come true
Whistle while you work
So hard all day
To be like other girls
To fit in in this glittering world
Don't give me songs
[GILES (Spoken)]
She needs backup. Anya, Tara...
[BUFFY]
Don't give me songs
Give me something to sing about
I need something to sing about
Life's a song
You don't get to rehearse
And every single verse
Can make it that much worse
Still, my friends don't know why I ignore
The million things or more
I should be dancing for
All the joy, life sends
Family and friends
All the twists and bends
Knowing that it ends
Well, that depends
On if they let you go
On if they know enough to know
That when you've bowed
You leave the crowd
There was no pain
No fear, no doubt
'Till they pulled me out
Of Heaven
So that's my refrain
I live in Hell
Cause I've been expelled
From Heaven
I think I was
In Heaven
So, give me something to sing about
Please
Give me something
[SPIKE]
Life's not a song
Life isn't bliss
Life is just this
It's living
You'll get along
The pain that you feel
You only can heal
By living
You have to go on living
So one of us is living
[DAWN (Spoken)]
The hardest thing in this world is to live in it
