[Verse 1]
I watch the red fire rise
And become all the water
I watch the red fire breathe
How many days will it blind?
[Verse 2]
I saw a red kite fly
Was it held by an anchor?
I saw a red kite burn
I saw a string gone astray
[Pre-Chorus]
Enemies change their minds
Don’t think you’re above it
Infinite blasts of light on wooded cares
Elements in the mind are tipping the public
Focusing on design from burning stairs
[Chorus]
Hold them, let them bleed, let them bleed
Find the main road
Hold them, hard to see, hard to see
Hear thе seagulls
Hold them, let thеm bleed, let them bleed
Find the main road
Hold them hard to see hard to see
Hear the sea
[Post-Chorus]
Slayers
Soul stars
[Verse 3]
I heard the red fire whine
And simmer in the water
Where the red fire wanders
I’ll walk in its veins, veins
[Pre-Chorus]
Enemies change their minds
Don’t think you’re above it
Infinite blasts of light on wooded cares
Elements in the mind are tipping the public
Focusing on design from burning stairs
[Chorus]
Hold them, let them bleed, let them bleed
Find the main road
Hold them, hard to see, hard to see
Hear the seagulls
Hold them, let them bleed, let them bleed
Find the main road
Hold them, hard to see, hard to see
Hear the seagulls
Hold them, let them bleed, let them bleed
Find the main road
Hold them, hard to see, hard to see
Hear the seagulls
Hold them, let them bleed, let them bleed
Find the main road
Hold them, hard to see, hard to see
Hear the seagulls
