[Verse 1]
Eyes upon me
Watching me in my perpetual sleep
Dreams deceive me
My future depends on a mindless dream
[Pre-Chorus]
I've fallen from promises
Damned to take risks on my own
The masterful science that freezes your
Mind and your soul
[Chorus]
The wretched dream is realized
The human race is to be crystallized
[Verse 2]
Thoughts of laughter
Filling the head of the master in charge
Worlds of wonder
Is this a cure or a painless death?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll fight and resist
Till they all see the end that is near
The doctors, the lawyers, and G-men
Are living in fear
[Chorus]
Living my life with one distant hope:
A cure that will kill this invincible foe
