[DAWN]
Where do we go from here?
[BUFFY & SPIKE]
Where do we go from here?
[GILES]
The battle's done and we kind of won
[GILES & TARA]
So we sound our victory cheer
Where do we go from here?
[ANYA & XANDER]
Why is the path unclear
When we know hope is near?
[ANYA, BUFFY, DAWN, GILES, SPIKE, TARA, WILLOW & XANDER]
Understand we'll go hand in hand, but we'll walk alone in fear
[GILES]
Tell me!
[ANYA, BUFFY, DAWN, GILES, TARA, WILLOW & XANDER]
Where do we go from here?
When does the end appear?
[SPIKE (Spoken)]
Bugger this
[ANYA, BUFFY, DAWN, GILES, TARA, WILLOW & XANDER]
When do the trumpets cheer?
[ANYA, DAWN, GILES, TARA, WILLOW & XANDER]
The curtains close on a kiss
God knows
You can tell the end is near
Where do we go from here?
