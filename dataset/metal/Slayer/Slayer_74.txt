[Verse 1]
High-velocity bullet at close range
Can damage the mind
Shattering the skull, shredding the brain
Severing the spine
Bury a round of lead in the chest
It's quite an impression
Imagine the innards of your soul
The infliction
[Chorus]
Instinctive regression
With intent to kill
No regard of human life
Or the blood spilled
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Verse 2]
Riddled convulsions
Confetti of flesh
Scattered helplessly
Losing your control of physical facilities
Release the slide to cleanse inside
Prepare to anoint
Snap the tongue in groove discharged
To make my hallowed point
[Chorus]
Instinctive regression
With intent to kill
No regard of human life
Or the blood spilled
[Bridge]
The power of a gun
Used with conviction
Dispersed on excursions
Randomly kills its victims
My sweet revenge
Bitter in depression
The thrilling release
Of a hated deep persuasion
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Outro]
The power of a gun
Used with conviction
Diffused compulsions
Unending repercussions
Violent emotion
Screaming revulsion
Spasmatic convulsions
Death, an empty gun
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
