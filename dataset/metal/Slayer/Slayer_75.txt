[Refrain]
Molten lead on your eyes
Do you know the sound of bones and joints breaking?
Hard to imagine and even harder to forget
It's like a lion's pride
Comes young and hungry and bites off the head
Of the old proud piece of shit
Face it, that's talent, bitch
[Chorus]
We were all meant for something
Me personally? Do massacre
We were all meant for something
Me personally? Do slaughter
[Post-Chorus]
I am Doom Slayer and you are nothing
[Verse]
Heart is bleeding but still beating
The strongest muscle, the strongest spirit
[Chorus]
We were all meant for something
Me personally? Do massacre
We were all meant for something
Me personally? Do slaughter
[Breakdown]
You are begging, I'm making choice
You trust in God, I am his voice
You can see six feet ditch
Pay up, pay up, karma is a bitch
[Refrain]
Molten lead on your eyes
Do you know the sound of bones and joints breaking?
Hard to imagine and even harder to forget
It's like a lion's pride
Comes young and hungry and bites off the head
Of the old proud piece of shit
Face it, that's talent, bitch
[Chorus]
We were all meant for something
Me personally? Do massacre
We were all meant for something
Me personally? Do slaughter
To slaughter
