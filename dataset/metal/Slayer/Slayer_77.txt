[Verse One - Rustage]
Uh, all it would take was night
Changing the course of my life
Seeing my family murdered in front of me
I can't believe she survived
Infected by a demon's blood
She's turning to the other side
And Giyu may cut us down
I will still stand my ground
Protecting my sister, you know I will fight
Training every second I be coming every mountain
Working on my body and invalidating who doubted
Shout it, loud from the treetops
I won't stop working till I feel my knees drop
But I will keep up, do it for family
I do not care if the corps will be mad at me
Outsmarting all my enemies speciality is strategy
This is my reality birth my sense of mortlity
Watch how I'm flowing like water
These are my people, not lambs to the slaughter
Slice you into quarters
Oughta applaud the corps of marauders
I'm a slayer, say your prayers
Uh, demons I'm making them pay up
Uh, I will find a cure for you
No matter what they're saying, uh

Doko ni itte mo (No matter where we go)
Soba ni itte kudasai (Please stand by my side)
Nagareru kawa yo (Just like a river flowing)
Shio ni ugokasa renai (Unmoved by the tides)
Ganbatte kure (Do your best for me)
Ganbatteru (And I'll do mine)
Issho ni yarou to suru koto wa dekiru (Together we can do anything)
Shinkokyu suru (Take a deep breath)
Ippomae ni Freedom (One step before freedom)
And together we will fight our demons
Woah
Kono nandai beaten (This challenge? Beaten)
Woah
We will fight our demons
Woah
Kono nandai beaten (This challenge? Beaten)
Woah
We will fight our demons
[Verse Two - Rustage]
Water breathing style
Take deep breaths and smile
I behead hostiles
Blade running like the Nile
Hit em with the first
Water surface
Slicing through with purpose, earnest
It's my burden but I'm certain
That these demons in for hurting
Kill it
How the metal feel with the
water wheel
Spinning, winning, chilling
When I'm killing it for real
Make em kneel
Gotta steel myself, it ain't easy
Wipe away the tears
Have no fear they can't beat me
See me
Every little drop in the puddle's another battle
I'm tackling any enemy ahead of me in travels
Every bit of me, fluidity
Hitting these like a new man
I won't ever stop until I take down Muzan
I'm an unstoppable force
Carving out my story
Standing by my sister till the end
Now you can't ignore me
And when I'm beaten and bleeding
You know I won't stop
Breathing I will show up
Dance Of The Fire God
