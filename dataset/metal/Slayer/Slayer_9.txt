[Chorus: Bexey]
I-I-I
Yeah, you just keep slaying through the night
No, try not to worry that you're mine
Oh baby, baby
You're my type
Exactly what I like
[Verse 1: Bexey]
Mm, she a night slayer
Razor all up in her Gucci Blazer
She got cocaine up on her septum ring, it don't phase her
She a heartbreaker
Got blood and love, and if I can make her
But love all night, baby, let me come inside
She don't text back to nobody
She don't let hands on her body
Oh, unless it's BEXEY or one of them boys in GBC
[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Touch down, new faces
Overseas, I brought blue faces
Suitcases, toothpaste
And my gold grills got her mind racing
Pop pills in that Freemason
Margiela, I'm drag racing (Skrrt)
Don't come if you ain't fuckin'
I'm on drugs when I'm in London
In public, on drugs and I'm in public (Woo)
[Chorus: Bexey]
I-I-I
Yeah, you just keep slaying through the night
No, try not to worry that you're mine
Oh baby, baby
You're my type
Exactly what I like
