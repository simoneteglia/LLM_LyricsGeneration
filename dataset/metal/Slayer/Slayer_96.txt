[Verse 1]
You're staring at the atrocity vendor
A fuckin' equal-opportunity offender
A sociopath with methodical control
Voyeur of terror, watch the scenes of death unfold
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you
Sever every part of you
Light you up with kerosene
Watch you burn, watch you bleed
[Chorus]
I am torture redefined
Cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell, yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels
Violence pulsing in my veins
Death forever reigns
[Lead – King]
[Verse 2]
In this chapel, I am the pastor
A fuckin' guarantee of your pending disaster
No limit to the anguish you'll see
Bear witness to this agony eternally
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you
Sever every part of you
Reeking of despair
This is no fuckin' nightmare
[Chorus]
I am torture unconfined
Cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell, yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels
Violence pulsing in my veins
Death forever reigns
[Lead – King]
[Verse 3]
You're staring at the atrocity vendor
Motherfuckin' equal-opportunity offender
So many parts of you I'll possess
Trophies of appendage are mine to obsess
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never hesitate to beat you, break you
Sever every part of you
First-class terror ride
Personal genocide
[Chorus]
I am evil unconfined
Cancer shooting from my eyes
Hell, yes, agony is real
I can show you how it feels
Violence pulsing in my veins
Death forever reigns
