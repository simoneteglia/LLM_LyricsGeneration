[Intro]
Got lil' Rex on the beat and I am not friendly
That boy Cassius
Wheezy Beats
[Chorus]
Doing ninety-five on the freeway
I did ninety-five on the freeway, uh
Do 'bout ninety-five on the freeway
I did ninety-five on the freeway
All this power and this money got me motivated
She been pouring up that potion, she ain't even thinking
All that white around her nose, she ain't even thinking
I might drown you in that water, I'm a demon slayer
I just took a trip out to LA
I ain't coming back for 'bout four days
I just took a trip out to LA (Took a trip)
I ain't coming back for 'bout for days
[Verse 1]
I did it for each and every one of them
Lately, I've been thinking 'bout the scholarship ('Bout the scholarship)
I just want my mula, need a lot of it (Need all my cash)
I'm so cocky and I'm feeling really confident (Woo)
I'm with 1400, yeah, that's a thousand men (That's my gang)
You ain't 1400, don't you represent (You not gang)
I just keep that cash on me like I never spend (That cash)
Out in L.A. with lil' Rex and we discussing checks
[Chorus]
Doing ninety-five on the freeway (Five)
I did ninety-five on the freeway, uh (Woo)
Do 'bout ninety-five on the freeway (Woo)
I did ninety-five on the freeway
All this power and this money got me motivated
She been pouring up that potion, she ain't even thinking
All that white around her nose, she ain't even thinking
I might drown you in that water, I'm a demon slayer
I just took a trip out to LA
I ain't coming back for 'bout four days
I just took a trip out to LA
I ain't coming back for 'bout for days
[Verse 2]
I thought that I told you I was never gonna lose
I'm with 777 breaking all the rules
I remember hopping gates and running after school
Now I'm in a Bentley or a newer Beamer coupe (Skrrt-skrrt)
She said that she love me, I know that it's lust
She say you don't want me, baby, I don't trust
I feel like you rolling, rolling, rolling off the drugs
I feel like you rolling off the drugs
[Chorus]
Doing ninety-five on the freeway (Five)
I did ninety-five on the freeway, uh
Do 'bout ninety-five on the freeway
I did ninety-five on the freeway
All this power and this money got me motivated (Oh yeah)
She been pouring up that potion, she ain't even thinking (Pouring)
All that white around her nose, she ain't even thinking
I might drown you in that water, I'm a demon slayer
I just took a trip out to LA (Took a trip there)
I ain't coming back for 'bout four days
I just took a trip out to LA (Took a trip)
I ain't coming back for 'bout for days
