[Giyu Tomioka: Baker the Legend]
I am a legend
Pillar of Water
When I’m in battle
Don’t do no talkin'
Tanjiro, listen,
your sister a problem
I’ll let her live only if you stop her
With the
demon slayer mark
, I press 'em
You the beginning,
I’m final selection
You think that I’m bluffin', you shouldn’t believe it
Ask what I did to that spider demon
[Shinobu Kocho: HalaCG]
I’m the Insect Pillar
Instill a certain fear when ya hear that I’m still around
Dropping demons,
dripping poison
Don’t wanna test me,
I'm the fastest fighter they found
I’m packing heat when I’m beating you
Might be small
, but I’m teaching you
Not gonna cut no heads off, bets off
No sweat at all when I’m defeating you
Using the power of breath
My sting will stab right through
Beware
My insect breathing butterfly dance will be the death of you
[Sanemi Shinazugawa: None Like Joshua]
Scars from these demons makes me harder to be reasoned with
I saw my family bleed to death
My mom had planned to eat the rest
, I’ll
Prove that Nezuko cannot resist marechi blood
And if Tanjiro is pissed, I’ll throw a whirlwind dust
Feel the gust, demon ash breezing past, no love
Knockin' the wind out of you, Hashiras show you how it’s done
[Hook: None Like Joshua]
Hashiras are comin', so the demons start runnin'
If Oyakata summoned us, there ain’t no discussion
Hashiras are comin', so the demons start runnin'
While these rookies still strugglin', we just cut 'em like it’s nothing
[Obanai Iguro: Gameboy Jones]
Hashira, now that’s some high tier strength
And my blade will bite you like a snake's sharp fangs
The swordsman from Slytherin 'bout to go get it in
Piercing the flesh, now these demons are withering
We’re the Pillars, better watch your step
A fight with us is like you choose your death
Exterminate demons 'till none of them breathing
I want them gone until their ain’t none left
[Mitsuri Kanroji: Twisted Savvy]
Mitsuri the Pillar of Love that’s lookin' mighty kawaii
Still trying to find a man that can be able to overpower me
You see me wield my blade with extreme flexibility
Six styles to my breath,
amplified by muscle density
I’m comin’ at you quick with the shivers of a first love
Then skip the anguish, I can shower you from above
Now I’m messin' up my nails and we’ve only just begun
And I’ll end it with a breeze, I’m not known for giving up
[Tengen Uzui: Rustage]
Bow down to the sound, getting loud 'cause I’m proud
See my power overloading as it shakes the ground
Look at all these demons retreating when I’m around
Drop bombs like I drop bars for the crowd
Feel the rhythm, it’s hidden, but I can hear it
See my weapons, I’m spinning them and they fear it
Flamboyantly unstoppable,
nobody coming near it
It’s over in a minute, the battle's done when I clear it
[Hook: None Like Joshua]
Hashiras are comin', so the demons start runnin'
If Oyakata summoned us, there ain’t no discussion
Hashiras are comin', so the demons start runnin'
While these rookies still strugglin', we just cut 'em like it’s nothing
[Gyomei Himejima: Dreaded Yasuke]
Better watch out when I roam
Only need five forms for the tall stone
Better watch your tone or get down on the prone
My Volcanic Rock going for the jawbone
Can’t keep a blind eye too long
, 'cause everybody grown
'Till I whip that flail on your lip (just the tip)
Ain’t nobody saying Hashira got no drip
I’mma pray a little bit before I power trip
[Muichiro Tokito: Vinny Noose]
Awaken the rage inside me
Tell me I’m serious, I’m never smiling
Memory’s gone
, but that’s all behind me
Breathing the mist in the form that I’m fighting
Master of the sword, join the Demon Corps
Poison in my body made me better than before
Building up the rage, flowing through my veins
Slay another demon, watch the body fade away
[Kyojuro Rengoku: Tokumei]
You enemies better get ready to feel the Breath of Flame
I’ll bring the pain to those who are hating, lame
Oppositions can get it if you in my lane
I’m past insane, you’re messing with the tiger's flames
There ain’t no escape from my purgatory
Will protect all my people 'till I’m old and boring
This burning passion makes me get up and go and
My flaming sword will burn you down to the bone
[Hook: None Like Joshua]
Hashiras are comin', so the demons start runnin'
If Oyakata summoned us, there ain’t no discussion
Hashiras are comin', so the demons start runnin'
While these rookies still strugglin', we just cut 'em like it’s nothing
