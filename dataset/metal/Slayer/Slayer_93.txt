[Verse 1]
I am the last of the dying insane
You would scream at the things I've done
Knowing now that the dead still see
My blood, it runs like mercury
Your last breath, the sword comes down
She dies first, speaking death to me
Philosophy, the vision, the view within
Duty, science, abstract cruelty
[Chorus]
What are your final thoughts?
Do you want to kill me, or die in shame?
From my point of view
Justified action, the enemy burns
[Verse 2]
The fun of massacre in the brain
Bioweapons and I are the same
Look at their face, hatred in their blood
Pile up the dead, my humanity
X-rays burn all that you can see
Nobody knows what a body can stand
Skulls on fire, yet mercy is worse
You seek only your pleasure in death
[Chorus]
What are your final thoughts?
Do you want to kill me, or die in shame?
From my point of view
Justified action, the enemy burns
[Post-Chorus]
Bacterial target, eyes exploding
Melting flesh through your mind
Become your madness, insanity wins
Infant's flesh on the walls
Testing limits, threshold of pain
Ripping out teeth to observe
I want blood!
[Lead – Hanneman]
[Lead – King]
[Bridge]
Knowing now the dead still see
My blood, it runs like mercury
Knowing now the dead still see
My blood, it runs like mercury
Knowing now the dead still see
My blood, it runs like mercury
Knowing now the dead still see
My blood, it runs like mercury
[Verse 3]
Human brain experiment
On prisoners, open skull
Vivisection, live dissection
Repulsion to the core
[Chorus]
What are your final thoughts?
Do you want to kill me, or die in shame?
From my point of view
Justified action, the enemy burns
Fuckin' burn!
[Outro]
Pathogens seek a horrible end
Churning factories of death
Crematoriums see your crime
You will see me in Hell
