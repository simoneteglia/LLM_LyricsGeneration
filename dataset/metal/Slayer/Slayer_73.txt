[Verse 1]
Evangelist, you claim God speaks through you
Your restless mouth, full of lies, gains popularity
You care not for the old that suffer
When empty pockets cry from hunger
[Pre-Chorus]
Penniless from their generosity
Sharing their money to quench your greed
Searching for the answer to their prayers
They cry their last wish of need:
[Chorus]
"Save me"
[Verse 2]
"His spirit lives and breathes in me"
The Almighty transformed to your screen
The meanings lost in its translation
No holy words, describe his deception
[Pre-Chorus]
You say you'll help us find the Lord
Tell me, preacher, how do you know?
A simple quest for a visible savior
To lead us through our final prayer:
[Chorus]
"Save me"
[Post-Chorus]
Send your donations
Contribute to the cause
Luxuries, your righteous reward?
"Praise the Lord, praise God"
Is what you wish to sell
There is no heaven without a hell
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Verse 3]
In your mind's eye, could you truly believe
That, by giving, you can save your soul
Could you be so na√Øve?!
You heal the sick, you raise the dead
You blind the congregation
With the things you say
[Bridge]
Religious blackmail, a deceit of trust
That death will come and all will be lost
[Verse 4]
Can you hear the serpent's call?
Look deep in those deceiving eyes
Ignore the writing on the wall
You should read between the lies
[Outro]
When doubt subsides, his honesty
An inquiry: Is it blasphemy?
Impure, the soul that's made to suffer
No sermons left to hide or cover
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled
To steal a dream or get it killed
They claim your trip to heaven's nearby
You may believe it, but Satan wouldn't lie
