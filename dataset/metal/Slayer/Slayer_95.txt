[Verse 1]
Stop and think of society's impotence
And the reason behind its incompetence
Faith in God is the vice, bring on the tyranny
Won't be long till you find the real irony
[Chorus]
Life drags on, and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness, we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high
[Verse 2]
Politician that claims to be the innocent
Sells you peace, then defies you with his insolence
Greed and power, his vices give him what he seeks
Manipulate and divide, forever lead the weak
[Chorus]
Life drags on, and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness, we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high
[Lead â€“ King/Holt]
[Verse 3]
You've been powerless to your vices
Self-control defies you
When nothing else quite suffices
Your demons will destroy you
[Bridge]
Holy man portrays the face of purity
Hiding behind a shroud of vanity
Pure lust is his vice, a sickness to defile
God becomes a device to hide the pedophile
[Chorus]
Life drags on, and we watch it bleed
On controversy and madness, we feed
It's a rush you can't deny
A little violence is the ultimate drug
Let's get high
[Outro]
So fuckin' high
Let's get high!
