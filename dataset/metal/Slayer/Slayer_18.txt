[Buffy]
I touch the fire and it freezes me
I look into it and it's black
Why can't I feel?
My skin should crack and peel
I want the fire back
Now, through the smoke she calls to me
To make my way across the flame
To save the day or maybe melt away
I guess it's all the same
So, I will walk through the fire
Cause where else can I turn?
I will walk through the fire
And let it—
[Spike]
The torch I bear is scorching me
And Buffy's laughing I've no doubt
I hope she fries
I'm free if that bitch dies!
I better help her out...
[Sweet]
Cause she is drawn to the fire
[Sweet/Spike]
Some people never learn/She will never learn
[Spike and Sweet]
And she will walk through the fire
And let it—
[Giles]
Will this do a thing to change her?
Am I leaving Dawn in danger?
Is my slayer too far gone to care?
[Xander]
What if Buffy can't defeat it?
[Anya]
Beady Eyes is right
We're needed!
...Or we could just sit around and glare
[Anya, Giles, Tara, Willow and Xander]
We'll see it through
It's what we're always here to do
So, we will walk through the fire...
[Buffy]
So one by one, they turn from me
I guess my friends can't face the cold
[Tara]
What can't we face
[Buffy]
But why I froze, not one among them knows
[Tara]
If we're together?
[Buffy]
And never can be told
[Anya]: She came from the grave much graver
[Sweet]: So one by one,
[Spike]:
First, he'll kill her, then I'll save her
They come to me
[Tara]: Everything is turning out so dark
The distant redness as their guide
[Buffy]: Going through the motions
[Spike]: No, I'll save her, then I'll kill her
But what they find
[Willow]:
I think this line's mostly filler
Ain't what they had in mind
Walking through the part
[Giles]: What's it going to take to strike a spark?
It's what they have inside
She will come to me!
These endless days are finally ending in a blaze
[Buffy, Anya, Giles, Spike, Tara, Willow and Xander]
And we are caught in the fire
At the point of no return
So we will walk through the fire
And let it
Burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
