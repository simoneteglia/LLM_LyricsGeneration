[Intro]
An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
Judgment Day, the Second Coming arrives
Before you see the light, you must die
[Verse 1]
Forgotten children conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never-ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality
[Refrain]
Chaos rampant in an age of distrust
Confrontations, impulsive habitat
[Verse 2]
Bastard sons
begat
your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Obtained by immoral observance, a domineering deity
[Refrain]
Chaos rampant in an age of distrust
Confrontations,
impulsive sabbath
[Chorus]
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Verse 3]
The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
The never-ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity
[Refrain]
Chaos rampant in an age of distrust
Confrontations, impulsive habitat
[Chorus]
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
