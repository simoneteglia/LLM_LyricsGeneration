[Verse 1]
When war cries echo, let it all begin
Never known any other way to fight, just win
Blood of the enemy when penance is due
You know that sacrifice starts with you
[Chorus]
Cast the first stone
Stand in my way
It's vengeance you owe
With blood, you will pay
[Verse 2]
I live for battle, the intensity knows no peer
Your defiance will prove severe
Choking on blood, beaten in pain
Realizing the fighting is all in vain
[Chorus]
Cast the first stone
Stand in my way
It's vengeance you owe
With blood, you will pay
[Bridge]
When war cries echo, sacrifice is you!
[Lead â€“ Holt and King]
[Verse 3]
You can feel that it's with me everywhere I walk
Like a devil spitting fire every time I talk
Manifested confidence you can't stop
A block of granite on my shoulder you can't knock off
[Chorus]
Cast the first stone
Stand in my way
It's vengeance you owe
With blood, you will pay
[Outro]
On fields of blood, you will pay!
