[Verse 1]
Awaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place?
Why are they haunting me?
I cannot look at God's face
[Verse 2]
Paralysing
Brilliant light
Trying to run
Want to scream, but cannot speak
I cannot look at God's face
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Blind my eyes, I can't see
What is being done to me
In my mind, only pain
All the memories are drained
[Verse 3]
Victimized
Specimen
Deathless torture
Void with no mercy
Black shroud blinds those who see
[Verse 4]
Violated
Naked before you I stand
Shattered shrine of flesh and bone
God's piercing through my soul
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
Segments of my life
Morbid pieces of reality
Twisted personality
Many faces yet faceless
Familiar things give way to strange
No mercy, no reason, just pain
[Verse 5]
Fatal
Sub-conscious control
Threshhold of pain unfolds
Transfixed martyr saving race
Who am I to judge thy grace
[Verse 1]
Awaken
In a web like Hell
How did I reach this place?
Why are they haunting me?
I cannot look at God's face
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Blind my eyes, I cannot see
What is being done to me
In my mind is only pain
All the memories are drained
