[SWEET]
Why'd you run away?
Don't you like my style?
Why don't you come and play?
I guarantee a great big smile
I come from the imagination
And I'm here strictly by your invocation
So what do you say?
Why don't we dance awhile?
I'm the heart of swing
I'm the twist and shout
When you gotta sing
When you gotta let it out
You call me and I come a-running
I turn the music on; I bring the fun in
Now, we're partying
That's what it's all about
'Cause I know, what you feel, girl
I know just what you feel, girl
[DAWN]
Oh, so you're like a good demon? Bringing the fun in?
[SWEET]
All these melodies, they go on too long
Then that energy starts to come on way too strong
All those hearts lay open; that must sting
Plus, some customers just die combusting
That's the penalty when life is but a song
You brought me down and doomed this town
So, when we blow this scene
Back we will go to my kingdom below and you will be my queen
Cause I know what you feel, girl
[DAWN]
No, you see
You and me
Wouldn't be very regal
[SWEET]
I'll make it real, girl
[DAWN]
What I mean
I'm fifteen
So, this queen thing's illegal
[SWEET]
I can bring whole cities to ruin
And still have time to get a soft-shoe in
[DAWN]
Well, that's great
But I'm late
And I'd hate to delay her
[SWEET]
Something's cooking, I'm at the griddle
I bought Nero his very first fiddle
[DAWN]
She'll get pissed
If I'm missed
See, my sister's the Slayer
[SWEET]
The Slayer?
[DAWN]
Yuh-huh
[SWEET]
Find her. Tell her...tell her everything. Just get her here. I want to see the Slayer burn
Now we're partying
That's what it's all about
