[Chorus: Daddyphatsnaps]
We the team, we the best yuh
Let em bleed, what a mess yuh
Hear the screams, but they won't ever get ya
One, two, three, we the killing Trifecta
[Verse 1: Tanjiro (Zach B)]
I heed the basics and always make observations
You really don't wanna see when I'm totally concentrated
I unleash it like it's easy 'til they're leaking and spraying
And by the evening when they see us, all these demons'll fade out
Just like the dust, now it's dusk, only follow ones I trust
When I take in every lesson I project it, it's a must
Never thought I'd be dependable, they had me at the cusp
Care for her more than myself, so she better not be touched
Got my lessons, every step until I honed it
Look I'm using all my senses as a weapon
, I was chosen
I am not afraid of death, I'll take a breath, I'm feeling golden
Look I've got nobody left because of them and now I'm focused, now they're hopeless
I was always
one to never give in, not even a shred
I have gone through lots that I couldn't go through again
I think we'll be alright if it's you and me in the end
Now it's all over if I ever see the thread
[Bridge: Daddyphatsnaps]
We the team
Let em bleed
Hear the screams
One, two, three, killing
[Verse 2: Zenitsu (Divide Music)]
What happened? Why are these demons scattered?
Just woke up, but I'm feeling knackered
Who could have defeated evil with so much precision
Man whoever did this knew what they were doing
Hear me screaming as I'm running with my tail
Tucked between I got no time, looking pale
Stand before a creature thinking I'm for sale
Forget to breathe, I pass out last I would inhale
Hey, now I can take it from here
Now the sun's down,
I'll be resupplying the fear
Got them questioning what happened to me, first I was afraid
Now I come with a guarantee because
I am never late
Got my head down, finger on the trigger, going solo
Countdown till my thunder strikes above your torso
Wake up, wait up, it happened again
Now put your hands together, say it with me "Amen" nah
[Bridge: Daddyphatsnaps]
Hear the screams
Hear the screams
Killing Trifecta
[Verse 3: Inosuke (Daddyphatsnaps)]
Y'all know me, I'mma king with these blades
Tanjiro with the Do Rag killing these waves
Beast boy breath, I be filling these graves
Get low, all four while I'm grinning these fangs
I can feel you and I will use
Anything in my vicinity to kill you
I'm a real one, I'mma real dude
Get buck and I'll show you what the
steel
do
Peel you, shred you to pieces
The beast is unleashed cus I kill without reason
The last thing you'll see is the sheen of serrated dual blades
I don't graze, when unsheathed
Cus you bleeding is feeding my demons
A Slayer who teamed up with players
I'll eat up this beat then delete you in neat little layers
Contortionist death, an unfortunate flex
Cus I'm "boaring" your organs right outta your chest
