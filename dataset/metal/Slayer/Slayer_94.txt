[Verse 1]
Deceased in mind, decree of death
Blackened heart baptized in fire
Exertion now, need to blitz
Vicious ways brought up in Hell
Draw the line, life or death
Potent thrust, excessive pain
Massive dose, adrenaline
Minor threat cannot decline
[Chorus]
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die
[Verse 2]
Victim of life, insanity lives
Deep in shock, intensive care
Tables turned, blast of strength
Kill at once, time to prevail
Begin to crank, feel the rush
Start to rage, take to extremes
Push too far, overkill
Time to die, no way to win
[Chorus]
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Bridge]
Running and hunting and slashing
And crushing and searching
And seeing and stabbing and shooting
And thrashing and smashing and
Burning, destroying, and killing
And bleeding and pleading, then death
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
At Mach ten velocity
Pressure builds, can't take the strain
Life blood flows to its grave
Dripping sweat, death shall erase
Time to think, time to breathe
Feel the pulse, life will expire
Surging speed, hell-a-fast
Cardiac cease to exist
[Chorus]
Stricken to live, Hell on Earth
Shackled and bound we lie
Praise of death, life's a dream
We're only living to die
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
