[Pre-Chorus]
She got that look up in her eyes
Like a Demon waits inside
She looks pretty in the light
But a heathen when it's night, yeah
She gon' make you feel obsessed
Suck your soul right out your chest
Yeah, I'm down to be possessed
Yeah, I'm down to be possessed
[Chorus]
'Cause she's a heartbreaker, dream taker, love faker
Yeah, you better watch out
'Cause, boy, you're headеd straight for danger
'Cause she's thе player, you're the game
She's the slayer, you're the slayed
[Verse 1]
She likes to get freaky with it
But she ain't no easy ticket
She gon' make you work to get it
She gon' pack her purse to hit it
But once she lets you in
You'll be coming back again
'Cause she's the type of girl
That turns a mate into a jealous friend, uh
She said, "Break me like you hate me"
I said, "Slow down," she said, "Make me"
Yeah, she's a different breed
Her energy is all I need 'cause she know just how to please
She said, "Choke me, touch me like you know me"
Leave the sheets soaking boy, just grab me like you own me
I'll fall in love for a night and again in the light
Yeah, she's something out a naughty book
I'll be reading twice 'cause I'm addicted
Body got me twisted
God, this girl is gifted like a high vision, vivid, when inside, I can't quit it
Push it right to our limits
Feel alive when we sinning (Sinning, sinning, sinning)
[Pre-Chorus]
She got that look up in her eyes
Like a Demon waits inside
She looks pretty in the light
But a heathen when it's night, yeah
She gon' make you feel obsessed
Suck your soul right out your chest
Yeah, I'm down to be possessed
Yeah, I'm down to be possessed
[Chorus]
'Cause she's a heartbreaker, dream taker, love faker
Yeah, you better watch out
'Cause, boy, you're headed straight for danger
'Cause she's the player, you're the game
She's the slayer, you're the slayed
[Bridge]
(Always wanted something like this)
(Always wanted something like this)
(Always wanted something like this)
(Always wanted something like this)
[Verse 2]
She got those eyes, she got those lips (Always wanted something like this)
She got those legs, she got those hips
She got a kink, fetish itch (Always wanted something like this)
Treat her right and she'll give you everything you want (Always wanted something like this)
Everything you need, she was built to please on her knees (Always wanted something like this)
What a perfect view, baby, pray to me, uh (Always wanted something like this)
She contagious in the dark
She was made, a piece of art (Always wanted something like this)
Got a shell that's thick and hard
It surrounds a blackened heart (Always wanted something like this)
Guess that's where she got her start
She could tear your soul apart (Always wanted something like this)
She got the fire inside her, uh
Devil on shoulder beside her, uh (Always wanted something like this)
Whispering telling her naughty things
'Cause he know just how to go and excite her, uh (Always wanted something like this)
She wanna fill her desires, uh
Who would I be to deny her, uh (Always wanted something like this)
I'll take her anywhere she wanna go
Yeah, I'm ready to be her lone driver, uh (Always wanted something like this)
She's bit by the craving
She wants a little tasting (Always wanted something like this)
Sinning hearts both racing, but synced up when we're laying (Always wanted something like this)
A slayer just slaying (Always wanted something like this)
She's a slayer, just slaying (Always wanted something like this)
