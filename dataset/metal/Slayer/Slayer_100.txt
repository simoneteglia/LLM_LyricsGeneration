[Buffy]
Every single night
The same arrangement
I go out and fight the fight
Still, I always feel the strange estrangement
Nothing here is real
Nothing here is right
I've been making shows of trading blows
Just hoping no one knows
That I've been going through the motions
Walking through the part
Nothing seems to penetrate my heart
I was always brave and kind of righteous
Now I find I'm wavering
Crawl out of your grave
You find this fight just doesn't mean a thing
[Vampire]
She ain't got that swing
[Buffy]
Thanks for noticing
[Vampires and Goat Demon]
She is pretty well with fiends from hell
But lately, we can tell
That she's just going through the motions (Going through the motions)
Faking it some how
[Goat Demon]
She's not even half the girl she...ow
[Buffy]
Will I stay this way forever?
Sleepwalk through my life's endeavor?
[Man]
How can I repayâ€”
[Buffy]
Whatever
I don't want to be
Going through the motions
Losing all my drive
I can't even see
If this is really me
And I just want to be
Alive!
