[Verse 1]
I stab you right between the eyes
You awaken from the lies
I've said it ever since its inception
They're the masters of deception
I'm a godless heretic
Not a God-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection
[Chorus]
My scars: insane
My life: profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide
[Lead – Hanneman]
[Verse 2]
Like a storm, I devastate
Religious doubt, I instigate
Take a listen to my confession
There's no filter on my aggression
With a pistol open wide
To keep the massacre alive
I'll cause global devastation
With my moral imperfection
[Chorus]
My scars: insane
My life: profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate worldwide
[Lead – King]
[Verse 3]
Religious doubt, I instigate
From what the Bible demonstrates
Does it document creation?
Or just hopelessness of fiction?
I'm a godless heretic
Not a God-fearing lunatic
That's why it's become my obsession
To treat God like an infection
[Chorus]
My scars: insane
My life: profane
I deny, defy
And spread a little hate world...
[Outro]
Wide-open, like a gushing, open wound
The walls of deceit will be crashing down soon
I've left you defenseless, mentally and then
Never fucking hear from you again
Never fucking heard from again
