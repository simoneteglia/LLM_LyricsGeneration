[Verse 1]
Join in my quest to leave life overturned
Spanning the world wave of doom
Spewing out death with the evil I've churned
Awaken the dead from their tombs
Love turns to lust, the sensations I've felt
Exploring the pleasures of sin
Making the best of the cards I've been dealt
Adjusting the odds so I win
[Chorus]
Unleash all my burning wrath
Potential killing machine
Take down all who block my path
Enjoying all that's obscene, born of fire
[Verse 2]
Prince of all darkness initiation
Ritually baptized in flames
Next to the throne, my abomination
Spread terror throughout my domain
Master the art that controls the impure
Inherit the infamous keys
Thousands of centuries I will endure
Tyrant of all prophecies
[Chorus]
Some have called me Satan's son
A name I cannot deny
Wielding fury that's second to none
Far too vile to confine, born of fire
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Hanneman]
[Bridge]
All things dead must rise again
When twilight's blanket falls
Splattered red, you'll find my den
Blood dripping from the walls
Dreams born of desire
Shaped, forged within the fire
Twisted, warped, deranged I see
The world's corrupt insanity
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
[Outro]
Dreams possess nightmarish figures
Burning, can't escape the embers
Lost are those who trust the liar
Satan's son, I'm born of fire
[Guitar Solo: Kerry King]
