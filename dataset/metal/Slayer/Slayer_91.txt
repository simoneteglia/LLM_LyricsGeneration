[Verse 1]
The traitor stands within the wolves' lair
Body count now imminent
The tension will rise, the air is on fire
This nightmare will not go on
Prophecy has touched my hand
The outcome starts here and now
Raise the flag as it burns
This nation's blood will not be lost
[Chorus]
Take the war
Taste the blood
Attack and continue
Never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack—continue—never
Never surrender
[Verse 2]
Your body hangs, piano wire plays
The music will relieve you
So delicate and lifeless now
Is innocence victorious?
Do you think I won't touch your grave?
Devotion to all insane
If war is lost, you will die before I
Without dignity for all to see
[Chorus]
Take the war
Taste the blood
Attack and continue
Never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack—continue—never
Never surrender
[Lead – King]
[Verse 3]
The terror won't end without you, my friend
This philosophy dreams of murder
Liquidated down painless face
Death has come, no one to mourn
Who will scream when all are gone?
Not for love, for the enemy
Fanatical zeal will bring this to an end
Divine providence: the world's end
[Bridge]
Drink the war
Piano wire plays
Your body hangs
Piano wire plays
[Chorus]
Take the war
Taste the blood
Attack and continue
Never surrender
We shall be victorious
Attack
Never surrender
