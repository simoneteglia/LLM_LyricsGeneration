[Verse 1]
Mortal, spawn on the altar
Caught in the heart of the blaze
The primal fear of disappearing
Becoming a ghost in the void
(Death)
[Verse 2]
Give a price, put a name
None of it real in this matter
Wandering, distracting
Wishing the life of another self
[Chorus]
We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all
We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all
[Verse 3]
We're all drawn into oursеlves
In a collective coma
Rеmember gazing up for answers
But now we're staring down
(Down)
(Down)
(Down)
(All is blur in the maze we put an end to all)
(All is blur in the maze we put an end to all)
[Chorus]
We were born for one thing
Tame the greatest fear of all
We were born for one thing
Born to face the greatest fear of all
[Bridge]
We're no one
United
When we're gone
