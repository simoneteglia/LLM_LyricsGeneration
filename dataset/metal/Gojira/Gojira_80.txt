[Intro]
The speed of the line was rending
My hands in blood, but I always
Grab on these darkened visions, and I try
My best to avoid this poison
[Verse 1]
Amplifying the sounds from under
Horror vision increasing, they're crawling
So broken, twisted, I feel their grasp on me
Can I trust this nightmare? Kill me
You wield a secret dark and so cold
Never bow and obey to soul control
Are these creatures a part of me insane?
And their shadows my only shelter, last creation
My only shelter, last creation
[Verse 2]
Run for your life like the wind, go, run
Leave behind the conflict, the load you carry
Don't fear the light of tomorrow
This fire will wipe them out forever
[Chorus]
Sound underground, alive
I grow my soul wide, inside
Grow
[Outro]
You wield a secret dark and so cold
Never bow and obey to soul control
Are these creatures a part of me insane
And their shadows my only shelter, last creation
