[Intro]
You have the power to heal yourself
[Verse 1]
All illness can be healed, the cell regenerates
Disambiguated situation
There is a secret code, the structure of the mind
You have the power to heal yourself
Flesh bodies mute and blinded, roaming uncertain, lost
Infected misinformed
Releasing a black enormous insect out from the chest
Archaic form disease
[Chorus]
Esoteric surgery, dissection of the soul
Unsuspected precise power
On the wounded astral body
Projected beam of light
[Verse 2]
All illness can be healed, the cell regenerates
Disambiguated situation
There is a secret code, the structure of the mind
You have the power to heal yourself
[Verse 3]
Suspended floating in empty spaces
Descending swift like a fire running down
Obstruction disintegration life force
Overcoming all circumstances, release the pain
