[Verse 1]
I've been a victim to the blade against myself
Bloodletting all of my soul
Sucked in, paralyzed in this vortex
Reduced to silence
In the dark, I've lingered too long
This sharpened axe, beam of light
I reach for, and I master
Wield against these shadows
[Chorus]
Its purpose now revealed in silence
Keep searching, question if this light ends
[Verse 2]
Now I will strike and dig with precision
Introspective eye, erase the concept
I lost my fears and the notion of time
I healed my sorrow
All boundaries are illusion
When you reach the centre light and
Reinforce the striking power
By chance you're followed
[Chorus]
Its purpose now revealed in silence
Keep searching, question if this light ends
All ghosts dwelling in inside, in the heart
I see them all, release their shadow
