[Verse 1]
Now from a solar system to another I fly
I come with life in my veins
Through darkened space I ran, I left a struggle behind
And faced the fear that's alive
I lost a world and traveled straight across from the sky
To find the gates of the heart
[Verse 2]
I come to Sirius C to learn from your friends of old
And wish to come into being
And behold I'm with you, I am ready now to go
The distance and even beyond
Recover all my forces, all the strength of the world
And feel the light into me
[Bridge]
From the strength of God
We go to the power of Goddess
This place is a throne for brightness
The age of war is over
[Verse 3]
For God's sake, they have never heard of you
"You'll never reach this master race"
Our force sickening, killing all the time
Human laws already slayed many lives
There was a streak of madness
But now I know, I see it's not the only truth
The scars in me are opened
Won't you please call me beyond?
[Verse 4]
Crave affection love and courage
Being courageous and flying instead of falling down
Follow these instructions I've been
Given in this dream awake
There is no goal to reach now
Leviathans, no complaint at all
Dolphins from upper space are in front of me
In present, they dwell
[Outro]
This is my way
I've found my home
My state of real
