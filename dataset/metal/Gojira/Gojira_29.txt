[Verse 1]
We pray, pray for the light to reign
We call, we call the day
We rise, pray for the wind to blow
We know, we know the way
[Chorus]
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
[Verse 2]
We pray, pray for the light to reign
We call, we call the day
[Chorus]
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
[Breakdown]
Go, go, go
[Verse 3]
We rise, pray for the wind to blow
(No)
