[Verse 1]
All that you see that is gold is truly gold
I spotted through the vines, a deer in the wild
[Refrain]
Signs in the trails
Beyond the reason
[Verse 2]
Eye-gazing the unknown, defeating the ground
This passage through the flames, leads me where the souls go
[Bridge]
Signs in the dreams
Beyond the reason
We're forced into the light
[Chorus]
How can we be so blind?
Our light is torn
How can we be so lame?
No truth being told
[Refrain]
Signs in the trails
Beyond the reason
[Verse 3]
All that you see that lives truly is alive
Let us stay awake reminded of the trails that matter
