[Verse 1]
There's a river of time
Let us worship this god of destruction
On nothing, we can rely
All is gone, belong to the past
You should learn by the time
Everything changing over and over
We're all falling so fast
Keep on burning
[Chorus]
Overwhelming power
Keep on burning, change
[Verse 2]
The old me didn't survive
Inexorable transfiguration
There is something at war
This red tainted flash on the wall
I'm nowhere to be found
Nothing matters, truth out of sight
In the air I dissolve
I'm fading away
[Chorus]
Overwhelming power
Keep on burning, change
