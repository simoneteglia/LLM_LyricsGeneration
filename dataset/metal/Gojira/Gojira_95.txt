Help me not to die
I'm possessed by the devil
Too dark are my visions
Need an exorcism
I'm the servant of the dark
Cannot die make you burn in hell
Kill the beast inside of me
Kill the lord of pain
Domination of the dark
Am I lost forever?
Devoured inside
Eat my soul and flesh
Help me not to die
I'm possessed by the devil
Emptiness on my side it's not me
My own blood on my hands, mutilate myself
Bleeding black, cannot see the light
I'm possessed, I'm the devil
I'm the (the) devil
Mutilate myself, my own blood
I'm dying
