Your words are so cold to me
Indisposed, don't hear your orders
Destroy the greatness of soul
Normalize what's in your hands
Take a look from the future
Get up from your dream and see
Deliverance soon is coming
For those who know
I take a sword in my hand now
I fight and kill Thanatos
Feel the ground under your feet
The roots so deep
Every step I chose to make
Was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became
Can't control my arms
Energy too strong, I feel
Hypnotize myself, Blood boils inside
For those who know, I want to be
As clear, as real, as I protect
Nothingness is all around
I hate the taste of your words
Every step I chose to make
Was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became
I hate the taste of my lost illusions
I choose to live for the only
Reasons I felt on the ground
I want to try
