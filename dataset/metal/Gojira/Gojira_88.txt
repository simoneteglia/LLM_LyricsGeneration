Lying as I watch the world die
But my soul is alive
No one helps me across the threshold
Of freedom, I'm so tired
Let me die, living the sacred breath
Don't want a king, I'm reaching
Taking the stars of light
You will die, into my locked-in syndrome now I fall
Cold, but inside face reality
Dream the skies of light
By the light so clean
And I fly deep inside, travelling through time
All the memories so loud to me. (Endless light.)
All the fears and the fights, they were standing so close
And the silence is watching me. (Wait for salvation.)
You must practice what they preach
Don't remember how to breathe
Yet you sold my dreams of light
Climb and walk, I'm serving high
Through these words, my speech to you
Now you're just my secret time
No one wants to hear my call
And I'm falling in the dreams
Now I'm fading away
