[Verse 1]
Breathing slowly, mechanical heartbeat
Losing contact with the living
Almighty TV plugged, hybrid empty brain
Don't see anything real in the game
The tension is building constantly
No reason, just a reflex I have, driven by clockwork
I try to keep an eye open, and I realize
I haven't closed my eyes in a long time
[Verse 2]
Neglected emotions leading to catastrophic voyage on the other side
I have been given so much stress and lack of confidence
I've been given the gift of so small hope deep inside
I haven't closed my eyes in a long time, I am trying
[Verse 3]
I cannot stomach these forms and colors anymore
But I'm here to continue after all I have been through
I try to keep my eyes open, I am realizing
This life and death more precious than anything
[Verse 4]
I won't bring no materials in the afterlife
Take no possessions, I would rather travel light
I'm of this kind that kills all day
But I don't know yet how to die
Art of dying is the way to let all go
Within I practice in the secret of my soul
My shape in the reflector has now forever
Life on its own
