[Devin Townsend]
I take what life's been given
With my bloody hands
Discovery of the world
As my head decides
Swallow the lies
From sick ideals
So my head is on fire
Can't stand the pressure
I've got to run away
My head is exploding
Come back to me reason
I fade away
All hail the new blood
Flowing from life again
[Joe Duplantier]
Let's go
Swallowing the dust from sick ideas from the past
This is this our refugees never gonna die
All hail the new blood flowing from life again
You take with all our breed and no respect to life
[Fredrik Thordendal Pre-Solo]
The operator passed out and lost control
The walk and wicked of all going to the wall
[Fredrik Thordendal Solo]
This life is so dead, consuming to the bone
Expand the pieces crushing to the face of all
From equal slayers of the earth, I hear the moan
A wretch destroys to wipe us from this race
I puncture in flame, what do and destroy
Filth soured from this world
Depends on our souls
From all blood and salt
