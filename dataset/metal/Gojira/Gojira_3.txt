[Verse 1]
So long I've been trying to match
It doesn't work, I'm trying, I don't know
The aberration of this world I tried to deal with
It killed a part of me that was raging
The pain is gone, the denial
I ran away from institutions
I owe myself life
[Verse 2]
There's no way I will risk all this pressure and
Anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight for
The reason you won't leave this cage, betray your child
The desire that you once had to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life
[Chorus]
Anger, lies, denial
[Verse 3]
This righteous anger boiling inside of us
Won't last forever, don't fear to let it out
Branches have grown through
The wolf is your master
[Outro]
The sky is all over me
I run on time
