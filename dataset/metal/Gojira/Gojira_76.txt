As I fight, trying to escape
Covering my soul
Watching the flames
I must understand this wizard
Fire is everything
Oh it burns, I provoke, It's beyond
I feel, I create light
Hypnotizing power I can't resist
Reach out my hands, I feel the light
Increase flames, the heat is oppressive
Disturbs my brain, I want to dive in...
Enter now so deep the flames
I respect the silence
Overcome with cold I pray
I see all the trees, the sky
The grass, the oceans
I embrace the world below
And I know now all the reasons
And all the countries
Fire begins and fire ends
Oh, it burns, fire is all...
