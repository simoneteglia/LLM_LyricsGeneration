[Verse 1]
Reflecting ourselves in the blood of all the beings we slay
Misunderstand each other, out of control we remain
There is a mystery, we're facing a sight to behold
This is what we make of the world, we throw everything away
[Verse 2]
The way we all behave is not understandable
It is so sad to see the wealth of our planet fade away
We all behave like children, taking off the head of our
Teddy bear to see what's inside, taking, not giving back
We drain the oceans and suck all the blood out of the soil
We spend the time we have left fighting and killing each other
Lust for comfort, entertainment becomes an obsession
And there is so much time to kill
[Chorus]
The way I see things is so simple
The fact I'm walking, standing on this land
Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying
The living creatures on our side
The way I see myself so confused, so sophisticated
I have to stay away from me
But I still don't get the point, what's worth destroying all the worlds
Try not to get it anymore
[Bridge]
You burn yourself, set fire for good
We die eyes closed, dig our own grave now
[Verse 3]
Tossed in the blaze, naked on the flame
Lost with no pride, drowned in the filth
The giant snake is coming down to eat our heads
And the flood will kill us, Mantus is rising from under
[Chorus]
The way I see things is so simple
The fact I'm living, dying on this land
Exhausted is the realm of nature, friends are dying
The living creatures on our side
The way I see myself so confused, so sophisticated
Don't have to stay away from me
But I still don't get the point, what's worth destroying all the worlds
Try not to get it anymore
[Outro]
Try not to get it anymore
Try not to get it anymore
Try not to get it anymore
