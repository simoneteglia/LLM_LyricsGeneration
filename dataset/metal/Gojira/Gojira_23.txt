[Verse 1]
Since day one you try your best
To get what you need the most
The solution is you
Becoming a god
[Chorus]
Only pain, all in vain
[Verse 2]
The day you get to the point
All illusions are lost
The problem is you
Becoming so cold
Just wanted to be good
Just wanted to be gold
Just wanted to be god
Just wanted to be
[Chorus]
Only pain, all in vain
[Bridge]
Take all, fear none
Wake up, go strong
Only pain
[Verse 3]
I'm the lamb who was slain
It's just another offering
I reclaim the might and power
Cast away long before dawn
In a cage left to rot
Creature fierce, tamed, is dying
Lost the feel for all I've loved
It's too strong, I'm going down
[Outro]
Down, down, down, down
