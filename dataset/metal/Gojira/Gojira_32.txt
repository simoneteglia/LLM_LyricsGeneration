[Intro]
I've been grinding and grinding
Oh, ocean have mercy
[Refrain]
I've been grinding and grinding
Oh, ocean have mercy
I give you my life
Oh, son of the sun
[Verse 1]
I've been rowing and rowing
No sign of land so far in the flood
I've been through fire and wind
I'm hanging, feet in the depth
[Verse 2]
Drowning all day long
In an ocean of stress
Gotta find a safety raft
Another wave is striking down
[Chorus]
Hold on, fight
We are merely grabbing on to
Hold on, fight
Unconscious ride around the core
[Bridge]
In a matter of time, you're out in the open
You shall prove yourself in the bitter end
But for now, brace yourself
[Chorus]
Hold on, fight
We are merely grabbing on to
Hold on, fight
Unconscious ride around the core
[Post-Chorus]
When you witness death you understand your demise
And you may embrace your destiny, the fate of all
And maybe when we die we rise high, find a ground
And we return where we belong
[Bridge]
Elders, deep under
Shelter, land
[Chorus]
Fight
We are merely grabbing on to life
Fight
One last attempt to break the code
[Chorus]
Hold on, fight
We are merely grabbing on to
Hold on, fight
Unconscious ride around the core
[Outro]
Hold on, fight
Hold on tight
Hold on, fight
Hold on tight
