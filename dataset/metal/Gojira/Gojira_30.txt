[Verse]
I just looked myself straight in the eyes and saw
That I had to move to higher places
So I took my courage in both hands and I
I pushed off the ground with all my might
Took off from the red place in the sky I fly
I have lost my reason, and I've made my sense
From up there I will see where I'm from and where
And where force of love will tell me now to go
But why do you say that you are lost
If you don't even try to find yourself?
My words are a stair I put my feet on
And I climb through starless night to my place
