[Verse 1]
All this evil, sanctified
You're not alone, you're not the only one
Overcrowded in your brain
You'll find a way out, or you will fall
[Chorus]
Get me out of here
I've been lost in the dark
Get me out of here
I'm locked inside me
[Verse 2]
No control over anything
I'm dying to learn, I'm dying to forget
Overcrowded in my mind
I have to let it go now
[Chorus]
Get me out of here
I've been lost in the dark
Get me out of here
Now
[Outro]
Overcrowded in our minds
We'll find a way out, right now
Now, now, now
