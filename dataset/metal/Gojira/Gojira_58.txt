I feel I come from better conditions
Buried deep in my mind I forgot
Awake my soul
I want to find and drink this light
Images of the past
Other life in other places
Always the same embraces
I return to where I've been
I dig inside a forwards movement
Involved in desire of consciousness
Progress, understand
I want to find the keys of past
Remember the past, present, future
Memory is a force
So many things have happened
To me the hardest of all
But the gates would never again
Be opened to me unless
I could bid them open at my
Own will and command
I feel I come from better conditions
(Opened them at my own will and command)
Buried deep in my mind I forgot
(Opened them at my own will and command)
Always the same light, same embraces
(Opened them at my own will and command)
I dig inside a forward movement
