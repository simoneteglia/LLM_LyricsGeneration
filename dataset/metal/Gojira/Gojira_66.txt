Lost, a lion came and said:
"Come, on the brink of the abyss"
Watch my feet
Swinging in the great empty one
Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades
C'etait un palais infini
No one else is able now to play
With the answers
And I open, my mind is so clear
There's a door in the wall of time
And I open, my mind is so clear...
