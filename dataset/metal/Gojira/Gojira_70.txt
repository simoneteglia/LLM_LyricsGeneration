[Verse]
This spot of light in space attracted my inner sight
The loved ones are so close, they talk to me in dreams
Contact the core I once felt I need to restore
Drifted away, I'm not the same anymore
These idle hands, the tools of my darkness
Always the same, this fire burning
This emptiness I should fill, the evil I have to fix
This happiness I should reach, come back to me in dreams
[Chorus]
Myself away so long, I've been refusing to feed
I always kept the flame, my will is to grow
Unfolded vision, a force is unveiled
It's all around me, from a void now explodes
[Outro]
Contact this force of light anytime, time
These lies in me dwell no more, more
