[Verse 1]
Four hundred thousand years ago
They came from outer space and gave us life here
And we are just taking everything for granted
I don't think we should do this now
And when I see the smoke around
I feel like I'm not from humankind down there
I feel like glaciers are my eyes
And mountains are my head, my heart is ocean
And I feel all alone
'Cause everybody's wrong
, I fear the living
What is this thing that we call hate?
And that's inside of me, get out of here
[Bridge]
A world is down, and none can rebuild it
Disabled lands are evolving
My eyes are shut, a vision is dying
My head explodes, and I fall in disgrace
[Verse 2]
I hold my inner child within
And tell him not to cry: "Don't fear the living"
One day you will stand as a king
And no fear can erase this light below us
Each one of us is now engaged
This secret we all have, this truth is growing
And as a warrior, I have to fight
I can already feel the love I'll discover
[Verse 3]
I had this dream, our planet surviving
The guiding stars always growing
And all the worlds, the fates all the countries
They're all rebuilding at the same time
I never fell and always believed in
We could evolve and get older
Open thy eyes and let all this flow in
Now see a new hope is growing inside
[Outro]
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
We will see our children growing
