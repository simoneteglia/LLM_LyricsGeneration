Want to protect myself from others
Dream, I run to better place
Hell, illusions, see
This state of me unconscious
Cannot want to undertake
Feel my soul
I want to build some fire
Burn myself
I decide of what I'll see
Call my name, I'll be there for you
Wrong and right
I, I want to create things
Beyond insight
Life
I want to build some fire
Run myself, dive
I dive within
Find a link between wrong and right
Understand, you create what you are
Be the link, you are what you create
And now comes in fire
Left and right connected
Call my name, I'll be there
I am there for you now
Understand you create what you are, understand
You create what you are, understand
