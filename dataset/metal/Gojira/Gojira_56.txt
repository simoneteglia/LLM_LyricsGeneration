He who learns must suffer
And even in our sleep
Pain that cannot forget
Falls drop by drop upon the heart
And in our own despair
Against our will
Comes wisdom to us
By the awful grace of god
Ease your pain
I cannot
With suffering
I don't
He who learns must suffer
And even in our sleep
Pain falls drop by drop
Upon the heart
Ease your pain
I cannot
With suffering
I don't
Against our will
Wisdom comes
