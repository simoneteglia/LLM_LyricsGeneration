[Verse 1]
Long lost illusions left a hole
You're filling the pond, a specter of the past
A pale light is keeping you awake
And dragging your skull, a pointless ritual
[Verse 2]
Make things right, straighten up the lies
You've been telling yourself all along
Look straight up, it's right in front of you
A vision through the reeds, a reason to go on
[Chorus]
New found splendor in the sky
New found land across the sea
[Verse 3]
The long days you've had, enough to figure out
What it is you dig and what you're bleeding for
A bright light now making you alive
Connecting the dots, a brand new ritual
[Chorus]
New found vision through the veil
New found colors for the blind
New found splendor in the sky
New found land across the sea
New found vision through the veil
New found colors for the blind
New found splendor in the sky
New found land across the sea
[Post-Chorus]
New found
New found
New found
New found
[Tag]
We're all on the same boat, we're going down
We're all on the same boat, we're going high
