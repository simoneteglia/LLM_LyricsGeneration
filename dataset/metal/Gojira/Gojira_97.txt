To reform my soul make me die
No blood laughing mine, gasoline
By the rise of mine, you will now
Know the truth and the lie of the world
So justice to be done
Illuminate the being
In the name of the second world
To my world define
In the dark of another day
Until the end of time
Immortal memory of a solid world
Now die suffering forever
Prisoners to the golden cage
To reform my soul make me die
No blood laughing mine, gasoline
By the rise of mine, you will now
Know the truth and the lie of the world
At the second light
In the name of the second world
To my world define
In the dark of another day
Until the end of time
