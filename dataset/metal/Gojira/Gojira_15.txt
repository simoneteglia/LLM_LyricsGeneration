[Verse 1]
We mock and slaughter all the purest kinds
Blinded by the noise and maze, this flash in our eyes
Hope for the world, but prepare for the worst
I'd rather find a way on my own
[Chorus]
Another world
Another place to be
Other world
A new place for me
[Verse 2]
Don't believe your lies, don't believe your tales
I'm longing for the day I will find
[Chorus]
Another world
Another place to be
Other world
A new place for me
[Chorus]
Another world
Another place to be
Other world
A new place for me
