[Intro]
Go
[Verse 1]
Jealousy will crush you to the bones
Unless you open up and let it go
I've only seen too much of it
I'm bursting open while you set the tone
[Verse 2]
You ignored this fury too long, I explode
Bring back to life this anger, let it grow
Put aside mind traps and false beliefs
These heavyweights created pull you down
[Verse 3]
The mask you wear is falling
Try on and watch it fall
Hands down, you feel the moment
Releasing out a lifetime
[Verse 4]
All prayers to these gods
While the tide is growing high
Will you make us stronger
When you strike us down?
