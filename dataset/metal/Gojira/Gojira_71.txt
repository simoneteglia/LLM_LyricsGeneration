I want to live in the forest forever
I want to live in the forest forever
Between the roots and the branches I lay
On the moss I sit, I want to rest by the river
I want to live in the forest forever
The power of trees, I want to feel forever
Connection with life, animals, and stars
On the moss I sit, I want to rest by the river
Between the roots and the branches I lay
Meditate the light wide open to the stars
Speak of the whales, deep in the oceans
Speak to the planets, deep universe
