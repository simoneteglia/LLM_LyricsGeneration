[Intro]
At the very first sound, there was just light
And then, a storm of time and space just came and struck
Created our time in water life
We understand it just only began
[Verse 1]
Forced to look to the sky and wonder why
We cannot face the fact that we're all scared now of mysteries of life
There is a mask that soon will fall before the strong embrace
Of love and might, of light in the dark
I go for a quest, I have to give myself the answer
Enter now this place in the wild, I can see the glade
My feeling now is growing bigger
[Chorus]
From the sky
From the sky
[Verse 2]
I do feel like no one can save me I am so alone
And yet I cried, I called for help, forsaken
But now I know the only way is understand the living
Obey the rule of light and face the fear inside out
Lost, I found there a stone erected in line
With one of the brightest stars of all the night sky vault
And I took my time, took off the moss
Washed away the dust and gave a new lease of life
Its mystical force
I grab it now and praise this lord of earth and stone
Make passage for souls awaken
So it returns to where it's always been with the gods
[Interlude]
Now coming, I feel the love, it comes from on high
[Bridge]
I know the words
But now I feel it inside
It grows, it's there
Now it comes
[Chorus]
From the sky
From the sky
