[Verse 1]
Mysterious form, soul in the dark
Under this heavy sealing concrete waves
Followed by servants, funeral cort√®ge
This pale ghost is gathering his strength
[Interlude]
Ghost, pale
The procession is crawling
[Verse 2]
Plastic form, dead things, it is now so clear
How could I fail to understand?
Cities are burning, the trees are dying
My heart awake, but still
[Chorus]
Pain is killing me
Pain is killing me
[Bridge]
Take this pestilent destruction out of my way
The great pacific garbage patch is exhausted
And the world is sliding away in a vortex of floating refuse
With the sacred one you have lost
[Outro]
Plastic bag in the sea
Plastic bag in the sea
Plastic bag in the sea
Plastic bag in the sea
