A giant bright eagle has come
On me and took away my universe
I find myself in trouble now
I put my soul in irresponsible hands
Exhausted I no longer try to reveal myself
And I no longer want to free my soul
But I must not forget all what I did for us
This way I feel myself irreplaceable
You had finally come to death
And you will never come to life again
Burn ego's black reality
Bring on the light I want to see your face
I feel the end is near for me, my world goodbye
People of the dead, I join you
In this confusion I don't even recall my name
There is something inside I want to reveal
I feel like I'm a part of this
And this a part of me
I know I must have confidence
That I will overcome
From now on I'm "this", and not "me"
I feel like I, I'm rising from the dead
From up here I see my inner world is dying
I'll overcome my pain
