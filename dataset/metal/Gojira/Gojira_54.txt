I reserve myself the right to protect, I
From intentions around
I see a thousand faces
In no one but myself I trust
I don't get love or care from this world of pain
Made my skin turn to stone
Bending under this load, I fall, and my skin is...
My fall accelerates with the weight
Soon I'll be underworld
Surviving radiations, not for long
And I'm burning
Raging storm deep inside
Unsuspected misery
Someone has betrayed my trust
Attempted suicide
My nerves tensed, hardened my skin becomes
But I give my horse its head, I'll overcome
Come, meet, under my lizard skin
I research the way to cleave through the air
My attention span is too short
My envelope is too tight now
And my skin is...
