[Verse 1]
Surrender to the grind
Embrace the laws that make you cringe
You will be fixed in no time
If you go all the way
[Refrain]
Grind
Grind
[Verse 2]
We're wandering in chaos
Forget about which reality is real
Eternal quest to resolve
Our struggle with gravity
[Bridge]
Youâ€™re all shredded, you're all scarred
Fighting the tide
Your tough face on, you think you'll last long
Against the grain?
[Breakdown]
Go
Surrender to the grind
Obey
Surrender to the grind
The only way
[Refrain]
Grind
Grind
[Outro]
Grind
