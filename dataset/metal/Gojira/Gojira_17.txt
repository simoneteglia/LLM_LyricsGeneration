[Intro]
Tell me what you see
In the afterlife
Par-delà le ciel
Par-delà le soleil
[Verse 1]
In all there is to learn
The sun is on our side
And though you're on the run
You will survive
Expanded to the state of light
The deepest corners of the world
Gliding through the
lowlands
And swimming all the oceans
Walking through the silence
Already made it through the night
There will be a new day
Whenever the sun rises
[Chorus]
You're invisible
You're in everything
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see
When you're everywhere
When you're everywhere
Tell me now
Tell me now
[Bridge]
While you drift away from all the plagues of this world
You're put out of misery, giant monster
You won't have to face it again
Every step of the way gets you higher
[Outro]
All the voices trapped underneath the ground
Let 'em all go in the sky
Find the power lost underneath the ground
Let it all blow in the sky
All the voices trapped in my head
Let 'em all scream in the night
Find the power lost underneath the ground
Let it all blow in the sky
