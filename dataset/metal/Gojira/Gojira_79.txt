Over the flows
I take my time
And I search and I turn around
Watching the stars
I want to dive in the sky
Deep inside of me
Over the sky
I found a place I can be
And there's no need to run
Follow my heart
I understand why and when
And what it's all about
Watching the signs
Dancing all around
Over the flows
I find out a way
And speak the words
Already know
And now I learn
To open the door
Open the door
