[Verse 1]
I'm sitting by a lake
But it's not of this Earth
The water is so clear
And the birds are alive
A mirror for the sky
All they see themselves and fly away
[Verse 2]
I'm sitting by a lake
The universe is alive
I lay down by the river-flow
It's a river of stars
I'm living by the ocean
It's an ocean of light
How do you call this place around?
It's a world that I once saw in a dream
[Verse 3]
Will you please tell me now
If I'm dead or alive?
Landscapes so bright all around
It's a city of light
Where, who, when, and why?
I think therefore I am
I feel like I know this land
But it must be so far away
[Verse 4]
This world is life, this clouds-and-wonders
Is all I need, and it will never go
You say it's lost, I don't believe it
This is my vision we can never know
This is the Earth, but ages after
I know the world will overcome its pain
The simple fact, I dream about it
Already makes it happen in the rain
[Verse 5]
It's right in front, but you don't face it
I'm dedicated all my life in me
And made of light, our sun is growing
Like in the heart of some of us, I pray
And other lands you will discover
This form of life is not the only one
I was a child, and I just knew it
And now I know the vision came alive
