[Verse 1]
Serpent of light
, movement of the soul
Crawling stately along the spine
Mighty Phoenix from the ashes arises
Firebird cycle of life, regenerate the cell
[Verse 2]
Life burns fierce, reduced to ashes
Resurrection from the flame,
ageless process
Quest for absolution,
out of bounds introspect
Self-consuming womb
,
ever-present, meet no end
[Chorus]
It seems like I always knew this
Since I'm a child, I can feel it
My inner light everlasting
Revolving within a circle
Extended wings I'm flying
Over the valleys and planes
The curve of space I'm leaving
Death is just an illusion
[Verse 3]
Oroborus symbol of eternal life
Dig a tunnel for light through ignorant walls
I'm counting the days, but I'm dying
Grow up with impatience, I'm falling down
On the peaks of radiant mountains
This truth is growing before me
My attention fixed on this silence
Rediscover life while I'm breathing
Designing the shape of material
Frozen icon distant reminder
Mankind has forgotten the gateways
By the mouth of the serpent regenerate
