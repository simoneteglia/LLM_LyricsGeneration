[Verse 1]
Anything that has a shape will crumble away, disappear
We belong to the circle life of all creation
We crawl, deny ourselves, refuse this evidence
That we project our greatest fears on death, forget our power
[Verse 2]
I want to live my life in close touch with the sacred
Pacify the disturbances of the mind, I face my own death
[Verse 3]
Lower and lower is the pressure
I can feel the parts of me collapsing one into the other
Higher state of consciousness awaken
I can see the light of this next world, leading my soul reborn
[Verse 4]
I find it hard to believe that this picture on the wall is everything
I do understand all the prayers, life is so sharp, hurts so bad
What does it mean to be dying? What if you take the guts and brain away?
Is it this blood and heartbeat that you call life?
[Verse 5]
Every effort to ignore it is unavailing, we all have to die
Is it too late to dull the edges of the pain? I have to try
This is an other dimension, you can scatter ashes to the winds
And even buried in the ground, I'm still here
[Bridge]
Do not be afraid, you are dying
And the four great elements of your body are collapsing one into the other
It feels as if you are being crushed by mountains
The light of this world has faded completely
But the light of the next world have not yet appeared
[Outro]
Your breath is now still, no warmth to your skin
Do not be afraid, there's no way that you can stay here
You are leaving this world, all lights are fading away now
Leave behind the loved ones and all you know
Do not be afraid and let yourself go
