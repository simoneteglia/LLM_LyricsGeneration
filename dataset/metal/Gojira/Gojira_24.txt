[Verse 1]
The sickness of this world is destroying all the dreams
The fools are kings, tearing apart the soul
The race for complication, communicate reaction
The lack of heart of men, I grow distant from the core
[Chorus]
Borrow this body for a lifetime
Earthly material
My soul unraveled out of mental
The shell returns to dust
[Verse 2]
I focus on the present, concentrate on what I find
Accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time
Bring light to my attention, the walls of vacuum fall
This force increases and tells me where to go
[Chorus]
Follow, I enter my dimension
Awakened heart for life
Enforce my senses; understanding
I find the will to live straight, oh
[Verse 3]
I feel the change, I see the vicious circle
Finally turned into a virtuous one
Having the whole world in my hands filled
Timelessness
Out of the frame, I feel so vast, I'm all around myself
Imaginative interaction
But I keep struggling inside to hold this always
Forever there
[Verse 4]
Is it the fear to fall in space that keeps us from understanding?
The only way to find the power is to look inside
Increase your fall on purpose and let this river flow
Now you hold this secret appeared out of the vacuum of space
Remain in what you are, the center of your life
You made it to this point, no one can tell you how
You crawled and bled all the way, but you were the only one that
Was tearing your soul apart, you finally find yourself
