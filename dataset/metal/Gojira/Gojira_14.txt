[Intro]
Go
[Verse 1]
I'm in a mental cage, I'm locked up
Imprisoned, I live deathlike, sickening
Strong is your hold on my resignation, I
Don't see the stars, my memories are veiled
[Verse 2]
In fluid dreams, I fall, I'm restless
Walls made of stone are turned into water now
Enlightened demons take by the hand
Approaching me,
this great eye speaking
[Verse 3]
Mountainous waves are breaking on my despair
Awaken me, but I'm still dreaming
And I just plunge into this sea of light
Set open the doors of soul I'm living
[Bridge]
Lightning struck me
I see the path I was so scared of
And fly to the stars
Conviction now increasing at last
My skin is broken
I see the smallest part of me now
My mind is alive
But I'll never bow to this again
[Verse 4]
Why do they call me there?
How can I fly?
All this water, I...
I don't feel like I could ever swim to them
Whales in the sky
I feel they're so close inside and yet so far away
[Verse 5]
Burst into tears, I feel sad, my dreams aflame
The force is now away
Lie on a stone, drop this load and cry to see
The ocean planet is on burn
