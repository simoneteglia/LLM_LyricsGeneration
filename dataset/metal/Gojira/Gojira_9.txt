[Verse 1]
Before all things reborn again
You learn the painful breath of time
Cold morning stretches out your arms
To the mighty warmth of one golden sun
Seems all have gone insane for gold
All was created out of the night
We're all born from the burst of a star
[Chorus]
The day you'll come to life you'll realize
Expanding force of life where you belong
And in the winter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright
[Chorus]
One day you'll walk the world and keep in mind
The heart you've been given in winter time
And through the bitter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright
