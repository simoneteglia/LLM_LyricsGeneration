A world of death and pain
Is waiting for you to be
Corruption, destruction
Welcome to where dreams agonise
In the morning of your life
They tell you how to lie
You did wrong, you will die
They tell you to justify
Taken for granted
As soon as born
Cruel are the rules
Engraved in your mind
Endless torture, pain and fear
You will hate the human race
Violation, devastation
Welcome to where dreams are dead
In the morning of your life
They tell you how to lie
You did wrong, you will die
They tell you to justify
The game is over
But no one cares
The guise is out
But no one knows
