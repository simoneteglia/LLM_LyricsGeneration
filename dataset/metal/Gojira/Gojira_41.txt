[Verse 1]
I'm scared to death when I see them arrive
Infected eyes, red, staring at me
The time has come for retribution
Now they're counting my actions
The cries and shouts are confusing me
Falling in disgrace, I don't want to go now
And I am facing them, it seems they recognize me
It's too late for regrets
[Verse 2]
They're growing darker while approaching me, creeping
Prowling vultures in the sky
Devoured by a ravening beast, raised
Fallen from the dead
Endure the pain that they're giving me slow
Flashes of life blurred by suffering
Distant reminder of funeral piles
Thousands of people dying
[Verse 3]
I'm taking back all the pain
Distributed through ages unconscious
My brain scattered, feed habitants of this cage
Consuming my heart
[Verse 4]
I've killed so many, I don't want to count
I spent a life raping the world
Both far and near before you now I come, please help
Creator, faultless one
