Slow, inside I take my time
Will come and fill the empty space
My wound I'll nurse, I'll understand
My pain one day will disappear
The land beyond is deep within
I took the path and I cannot go back
I've just connected myself with I
But I don't know me that well as you see
Cover the distance
Find my world
I walk inside to the heart of my kingdom
Climb up a mountain and stand on the top of it
I am the king and I am the servant
Follow the rules of loving mighty power
