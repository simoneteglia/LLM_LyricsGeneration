Be some mortal inside
Blood is the corridor of death
Pray for life eternal
Pay for the price, ain't nothing fair
Like the devil, innocent witness
Birth of the Jew, am I obliged to die to be free?
Blood, my body to the mortal
Now I die all the innocent death
Non-believers in the below
Brutal abortion
Be some mortal inside
Blood is the corridor of death
Pray for life eternal
Pay for the price, ain't nothing fair
Brutal abortion
