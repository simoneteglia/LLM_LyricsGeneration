I have no words
No words for this
Howl growl hiss
You held me underwater
For too long
I couldn't breathe
I couldn't come up for air
Righteous anger
Righteous rage
Pain is on a rampage
Young victim comes of age
There's no taking back
What you said to me
There's no coming back
On what you did to me
DEATH
Too late to tell me
You're sorry and sad
Too late to explain
The trouble you had
You had your boot upon
My neck too long
I couldn't move
I couldn't yell or swear
Righteous anger
Righteous rage
Pain is on a rampage
Young victim comes of age
