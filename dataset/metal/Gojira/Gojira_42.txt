[Verse 1]
On my way
to the vision-come-true
I enter a galaxy rising
And I land on this brown and green old place
Whose wild is giant trees
Trees so strong that they never can fall
Four suns alight in silver-grey sky
Wild river flows with rage alive
Lions of fire approach me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Carved by the wind and the fall of water
From the treetops, I can see the end of a time
[Chorus]
Living respectful, low your axe
And learn from the trees
[Verse 2]
Second dawn meet the sylvanlings
Passageways into the deep
Invitations to explore the forest
Lions gales and chambers
[Pre-Chorus 2]
A tree trunk larger than a mountain
Stands on the top of this hill made of rock and mist
[Chorus]
Living respectful, low your axe
And learn from the trees
[Verse 3]
Henceforth, I will be always there
Planet Earth will overcome
Men destroyed, scorned and killed their lives
But the world is on her way
