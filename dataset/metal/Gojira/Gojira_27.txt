[Intro]
Go
[Verse 1]
Say something about awakening
The rebellion you felt before
Wake, change your course
Laws will follow
Restart, reactivate the core
[Chorus]
Rise
Yeah, you come out
You're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding
Now you throw yourself
Into the storm
[Verse 2]
Stand, gather your strength, raise your eyes
Fear not the demons you're up against
[Chorus]
Now that you dove down
Found the bottom begging for air
How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight
Yeah, you come out
You're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding
Now you throw yourself
Into the storm
[Bridge]
Flames
Dancing in the open
You step into the light
You step into the light
[Chorus]
Now that you dove down
Found the bottom begging for air
How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight
Yeah, you come out
You're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding
Now you throw yourself
Into the storm
[Outro]
Storm
Into the storm
Storm
