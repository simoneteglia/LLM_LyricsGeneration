You forgot I was immortal
Trying to kill myself
Blood, the taste of victory
Victory to grow
Torture you give me, I'm suffering
Genocide, execution, you take me
Blood, cut flesh, I'm dying
Silently in a lifeless torture
Razor giving jab of kill, I need it
Harrow, keep on rotting, I'm alive
Blindness, feel the blade on my neck, to set me free
Return blind violence upon me
Die, the only way to escape
Escape a world of hate
Blood to take the victory
Victory to be
Torture you give if I, I'm suffering
Genocide, execution, and butchery
Blood, cut flesh, I'm dying
Century in a lifeless torture
