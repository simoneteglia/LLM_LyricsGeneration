Last night, alone, I met the moon
I saw its halo and the love around
"Now take the path, don't ever lose your time
Just watch the light you have inside"
I watched inside and my eyes burned
The moon was right
The roots so deep, and the head so high
I want to be in and watch it out
I know the reasons why I failed
The stars illuminate my being
Behold thy servant, you the force around
That makes the planets be
