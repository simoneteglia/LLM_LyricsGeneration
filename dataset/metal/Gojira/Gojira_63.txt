[Intro]
Are we left all alone?
Mother has no time, but she cares for me
And she cries all the tears
I am joining now the river flow
[Verse 1]
I am three days old
Now the time has come, you have to be a man
I don't want to destroy
The only chance I have to survive down here
The wind blows, I'm so scared
And the waves so big, I'm not prepared
I will have to be strong
But for now, I cry all the tears
[Verse 2]
Now enter the storm and feel electric sword
My entire life is about to burn
I am struggling, life is illusion
But I keep the dream of a better time
[Bridge]
This secret knowledge I receive from where I am
So precious, the treasured icons
Extended to this point, forget the ones that hurt
They all want, they struggle, they fight and try to dry their tears
[Verse 3]
We're all left on our own
We are bound yet by each other's lives
Now I'm leaving this world
I will never forget river flow
[Outro]
The pains and traps of life
I put my scars away and love
I have to face the truth of living
I left my boat behind, I am not taking it
Where I go, I won't be crying, I die
