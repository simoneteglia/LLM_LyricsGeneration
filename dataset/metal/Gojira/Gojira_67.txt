[Verse 1]
Ride a horse that's cleaving through
The air and space of dreams
Travelling through time
All alone I pray
Where am I? Who am I?
And that old man trusts in me
His words are running now
Because we have lost all guides
You're extended now to a world of light
[Chorus]
You're not the one
You think you are
Since you were born
You're only love
[Verse 2]
On a mountain I'm standing now
And it's coming over me
That I'm not here
I am on another plane
Jumping around, hit myself
I returned inside of me
Tears sliding down my face
(I die again)
And the horse is leaving me
Running out of space
Running out of reach
[Chorus]
You're not the one
You think you are
Since you were born
An Indian tribe
