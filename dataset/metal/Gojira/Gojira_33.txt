[Verse 1]
Call upon the wise one to remember the chords
The truth buried alive since the dawn of time
Was it all for nothing? Great watcher of the soul
Rid the world of its blindfold, make us real again
[Chorus]
Carved in limestone
That's all there is,
facing the lion
Become one
You stand still, the voice of silence
Remain one
[Verse 2]
Express your will, you will be rewarded
For all thoughts become reality
May we lеarn from the old one
Standing tall in the sand
Witnеss erosion, the rise and fall of men
[Chorus]
Carved in limestone
That's all there is,
facing the lion
Become one
You stand still, the voice of silence
Remain one
[Post-Chorus]
Become one
[Bridge]
The savior has arrived
The savior has a name
[Chorus]
Carved in limestone
You become one
Facing the lion
You become one
