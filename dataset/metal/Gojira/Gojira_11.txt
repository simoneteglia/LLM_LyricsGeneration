[Verse 1]
Incite a riot, put yourself in a trance
You rotate the frame in a world you rely on
A scar, a line has been drawn in the sand
Behold the life, the boundaries fools will crush
[Chorus]
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground
[Verse 2]
Onto the next stage of the plan
Mourn the witness of the wind
A handful of thunder
Will rise one last time
[Chorus]
There's fire in the sky
You're in the Amazon
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground
[Post-Chorus]
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
Mighty Amazonia
Killing Amazonia
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
Mighty Amazonia
Killing Amazonia
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
[Bridge]
Burn
The land
Learn
The end
Burn
Another gold mine is unveiled
The source of our sorrow
Learn
Embedded in these walls of green
Is the curse that we follow
[Chorus]
There's fire in the sky
You're in the Amazon
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground
