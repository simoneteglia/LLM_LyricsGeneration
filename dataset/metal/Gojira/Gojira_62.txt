I sit on a rock
Cannot be touched by struggle and confusion
I reclaim my space inside my structure
Look at this point
All is about nothing, everything comes near
The remotest parts of the world
By silence
We can dissolve disruptive vibrations
I have to try
Ga√Øa's alive for good
Under my feet the forest
Over me the largest
It's roundness I feel
Lifelong misery
How do we get to Avalon?
There is a bridge beyond
Indestructible, the earth is a temple
I cannot see what is wrong and
All gods are one
I close my eyes
I'm all around, I feel so present
Embracing it's vastness I hold
Facing the world
I become a part of it
I'm not alone anymore
I embrace the world
I embrace the world
I embrace the world
I embrace the world
I embrace the world
I embrace the world
