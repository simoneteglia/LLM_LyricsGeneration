Them wolves are all around me
I take my stories inside
Waiting a sign from my future
They have already found
I wish I've never been born
A serious need of something else
I pack the power inside
Welcome the slave of my future
Under a dying world
New vision of life
Fight till the rise of dawn
Open doors that I'm meeting, why it's real?
Every step so complex, don't you see? Imitation sight
What can't think of the other wait for no way
Bring on holy presence, nothing is
In the devil
Interest In the name of technology
Suffocate In the wake of progress
Overdose of nothing else
I want to believe in myself
In the vacancy
In the cold of concrete
Intellect is the world we kill
Saturate in this drop
My source to kill inside
Waiting a sign from my future
They have already found
I wish I've never been born
New vision of life
I'll fight till the rise of dawn
