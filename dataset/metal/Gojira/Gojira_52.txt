[Verse 1: Randy Blythe &
Joe Duplantier
]
Everyone is doing their best to destroy it
Simplicity's forgotten, and we all drill the ground
I stand free, I refuse to be surrounded
The stones and dust bite hostile, devours flesh and bone
The weakest lost in hatred, consequence is upon my door
Responsible for my own life, I'm reborn again and again
Driven to increase my own power by creation the purest choice
Destined to rule my life and go the way of the flesh
Nature is my only master, I will bow to no one
The ground is dry like rock without any hope left aside
But now I decide to grab my life with my hands
[Bridge: Randy Blythe &
Joe Duplantier
]
Crave for freedom build my own life
Adoration for none
Reaction is a weakness the strong cannot afford
My path is not determined by actions of others
[Verse 2: Randy Blythe &
Joe Duplantier
]
They fill themselves with hate, covering their faces blackened
The wolves are back and crave to kill
Slip on stones and break their legs, try to hide from termination
But the time has come, you will have to pay the debt of nature
[Chorus: Joe Duplantier]
And now you are the one to change the face of the world
You wield the sword, the pain is left aside
And I have left my tears behind me
So I refind the way that I know so bright to me
And I only adore the fact
That we are the creators of our own lives
And lust for power is the master disease of our time
This force alone devours the weak and rules the strongest
[Outro: Randy Blythe &
Joe Duplantier
]
So mired in convolution, it chokes the life from your throat
Break the chains of complication, I breathe the air of freedom
There is no room for your judgment, my life is mine alone
I purge myself of resentment, I breathe the air of freedom
