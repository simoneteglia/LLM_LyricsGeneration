[Chorus]
Praise all my sisters
We belong dead
The king of pacific waters
Claims all our head
Praise all my sisters
We belong dead
Stop crying don't be sad
It ain't so bad
[Verse]
This our fate to drown
In the depths of the ocean
Time to become one
With the fangs of the fallen
Thermonuclear claws
End the days that we sulk in
Wives of Gojira
No need to be sullen
[Chorus]
Praise all my sisters
We belong dead
The king of pacific waters
Claims all our head
Praise all my sisters
We belong dead
Stop crying don't be sad
It ain't so bad
[Verse]
This our fate to drown
In the depths of the ocean
Time to become one
With the fangs of the fallen
Thermonuclear claws
End the days that we sulk in
Wives of Gojira
No need to be sullen
[Instrumental Outro]
[Spoken word]
There I was
Sitting just a chair away from God
The Allmother calling me a bat, a pest over a cup of coffee
The wind was howling
Waters crackled around our feet
I looked at her in the eye
A moment of silence
I braced myself to ask her
"aren't we all time travelers?
Visiting the past everyday to try shape the future?
Isn't that human nature
One with your image
Would you say that we are all cheaters?
Wouldn't it also make you one?
I am me, because I learn from the past
So you can't stop me
Not or nor any god
I won't forget what I am
I won't forget yesterday
Even in the face of hell
