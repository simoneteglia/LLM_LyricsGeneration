[Verse 1]
Oh, what are you gonna do
When there's a part of you that needs to run with the wind?
And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way to lead you from the garden of the dark
Stay out of shadows, now
Looks like the change is on
Tomorrow's never gone, today just never comes
Go on and jump, yeah
Into the hurricane
You will forget the pain, it's only there to exorcise your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Looking at the world when you've opened up your eyes
You've got to see the promises they've made
They're bloody lies and broken dreams
Your silent screams
[Chorus]
You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Someone that you've never seen
Somewhere you've never been
You're living in a time machine
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Oh, what are you gonna do
When every part of you just needs to catch that wind?
And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way to lead you from the garden of the dark
[Pre-Chorus]
Looking for the world when you've opened up your eyes
You'll see you've got invisible chains
They're only lies, not what it seems
I hear your silent screams
[Chorus]
You're living in a time machine
Nobody cares just where you go
Taken where you've never been
Vacate to somewhere you don't know
Living in a time machine
Why do you stay who you are?
Be what you've never been
Someone you've never seen
You're living in a time machine, yeah
