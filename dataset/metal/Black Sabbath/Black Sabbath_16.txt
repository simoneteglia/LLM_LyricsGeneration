[Verse 1]
What you get and what you see
Things that don’t come easily
Feeling happy in my pain
Icicles within my brain (
Cocaine
)
[Verse 2]
Something blowing in my head
Winds of ice that soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold
[Bridge]
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the trees
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon I’ll feel the chilling glow
[Bridge]
Right!
Don’t you think I know what I’m doing
Don’t tell me that it’s doing me wrong
You’re the one that’s really the loser
This is where I feel I belong
Right!
[Verse 4]
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
[Guitar Solo]
