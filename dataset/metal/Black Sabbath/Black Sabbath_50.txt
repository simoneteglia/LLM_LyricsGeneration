[Verse 1]
So you think you know
What's going on inside her head
You think she wants your money
But it's you she wants instead
[Verse 2]
When you think about the things
That she did long ago
It breaks your heart but deep down, boy
You don't want her to go
[Verse 3]
You feel your nerves are shattering
You feel you want to die
Just because the one mistake
Of telling you a lie
[Verse 4]
If I were you I'd try again
And try to make amends
She only thinks of you, you know
I'm talking as a friend
