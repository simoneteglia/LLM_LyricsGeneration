[Verse 1]
The neon lights are shinin' on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night
Through the night
If I could find her then everything would be alright
[Verse 2]
The sleepy city is dreamin' the night time away
Out on the street, I watch tomorrow becomin' today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale
Yes, for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me comin', you've got me goin' around
Oh, dirty women, they don't mess around
[Outro]
Let's go
Walkin' the streets I wonder will it ever happen (Dirty women)
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be okay (Dirty women)
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy (Dirty women)
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day (Dirty women)
(Dirty women, dirty women, dirty women, dirty women...)
