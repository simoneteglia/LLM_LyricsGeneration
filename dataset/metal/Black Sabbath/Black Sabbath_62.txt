[Verse 1]
It's a long way to nowhere
And I'm leaving very soon
On the way we pass so close
To the back side of the moon
[Refrain]
Hey, join the traveler
If you've got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know
[Chorus]
Oh, lonely is the word, yeah yeah yeah
[Verse 2]
I've been higher than stardust
I've been seen upon the sun
I used to count in millions then
But now I only count in one
[Refrain]
C'mon, join the traveler
If you've got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know
[Chorus]
Yeah, lonely is the word
Got to be the saddest song I've ever heard
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Yeah, lonely is the name
Maybe life's a losing game
[Instrumental Outro]
