[Part I]
[Intro]
Yeah
See
[Verse 1]
Inclination of direction
Walk and turn and twist adrift
With the children of creation
Futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper
With a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers
That are surely doomed to die
[Verse 2]
Won’t you help me, Mister Jesus
Won’t you tell me if you can
When you see this world we live in
Do you still believe in Man
If my song’s become my freedom
And my freedom turns to gold
Then I’ll ask the final question
If the answer could be sold
[Part II]
[Verse 3]
Well, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it
’Cause I got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don’t even exist
And I’ll show you a way to get high
[Refrain]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
[Verse 4]
So come alive, you know you’re magic to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don’t you think I know my own mind
[Refrain]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
[Verse 5]
Why can’t you believe, it's right here to be seen
Do you always have to be told, yeah
For you and your problem, you can never give up
Long before the answer was sold
[Refrain]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
[Guitar Solo]
