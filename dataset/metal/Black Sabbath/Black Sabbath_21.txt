[Verse 1]
Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, a wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Long grey cloak, tinkling bell
[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
[Verse 2]
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by
[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
[Verse 3]
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine
[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic
