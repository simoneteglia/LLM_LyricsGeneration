[Verse 1]
Close the city and tell the people that
Something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to
Take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away
[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
The mob rules
[Verse 2]
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded
The end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and
Lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun
[Hook]
If you listen to fools
The mob rules
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
You've nothing to say
Oh, they're breaking away
If you listen to fools
[Verse 3]
Break the circle and stop the movement
The wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and
Take you right back around
[Outro]
You're all fools
The mob rules
