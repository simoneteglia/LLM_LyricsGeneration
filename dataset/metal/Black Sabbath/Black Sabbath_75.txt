[Verse 1]
Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision, genocide
Computerize God, it's the new religion
Program the brain, not the heartbeat
[Verse 2]
Onward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow, energize
Digital dreams and you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Take a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel
[Chorus]
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down
[Verse 3]
Love is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate, it's a calculation
Send in the child for connection
[Pre-Chorus]
Take a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real
[Chorus]
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasy
Your past is your future
Left behind, lost in time
Will you surrender?
[Verse 4]
Waiting for the revolution
Program the brain, not the heartbeat
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 5]
Deliver us to evil, deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populate
Virtual existence with a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation, destroyer of mankind
Termination of our youth
For we do not compute
No
[Instrumental Outro]
