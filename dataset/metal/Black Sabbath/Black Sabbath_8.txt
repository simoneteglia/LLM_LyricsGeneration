[Verse 1]
We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes, the black night sighs
The moon in silver dreams
Falls down in beams, light of the night
The Earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze in orbit always
[Verse 2]
While down below, the trees bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks dawn from night
And so, we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars as we travel the universe
[Instrumental Outro]
