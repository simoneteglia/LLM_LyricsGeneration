[Intro]
I am Iron Man
[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves, will he fall?
[Verse 2]
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind
[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 5]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again
[Instrumental Outro]
