[Verse 1]
Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of a shattered world
That's gonna die
In the age of reason
How do we survive?
The protocols of evil ravaging
So many lives
So many lives
So many lives
[Verse 2]
Mystifying silence
Talking peace on Earth
We should judge each other for ourselves
Not what we're worth
Sustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution disappears
Without a trace
Without a trace
Without a trace
Alright yeah!
[Bridge]
Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that donâ€™t bear fruit
[Outro]
Oh yeah
These times are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over, but the war goes on
Politics, religion, love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah
