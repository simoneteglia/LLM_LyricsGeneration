[Verse 1]
He's just a loner, he never says hello
A friend to no one, he's got no place to go
He don't look happy, he looks through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing, no one to sympathize
Alright now
He hides himself away, his secrets not revealed
As life just passes by, he keeps himself concealed
A solitary man, an enigmatic child
A riddle never solved, a prisoner exiled
Alright now
[Chorus]
I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A lifeless lived alone plays devil's advocate
Come on now
[Bridge]
Has he ever tried to be happy? Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting too late to recover, he won't stand a chance
And into his own hell, he'll descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
[Verse 2]
No understanding of things we already know
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go
Alright, yeah
[Chorus]
Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend, but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead
Come on, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
