If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah
Fade away, fade away
Vanish into smoke
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
It's the sign
Feels like the time
On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo doesn't answer
When it hears a certain song
Then the Beast is free to wander
But never seen around
And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross, alright
Sail away to the sign
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Give a knife to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of sighs
And it's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Fade away, fade away
Break the crystal ball
Fade away, fade away
I can't accept it anymore
On a real world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
When the summer falls
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten psalms
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
It's the sign of the southern cross
It's the sign of the southern cross
Don't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away
Eight miles high
, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The sign of the southern cross
Play on!
