[Verse 1]
People say my mind's all filled with things that you can't see me now
Why are you on my mind all day long? I can't think straight no more
Everyone is sayin' I'm mad because you're the only girl that I've ever had
I love you but you don't wanna know me but I think you're great and I wanna see
[Chorus]
I wanna see you
Smiling to my face
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
You and me are through I know but you're on my mind all day long
Guessin' me and you are going crazy because I can't see you
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
All I've said inside right now, I can't think to think and I can't go by
Everyone is saying to me, "Forget that girl, don't misery"
I've just one more thing to say before my mind's all set and I wanna stay
I'm of things and you don't know what you're doing to my mind, you're on inside
