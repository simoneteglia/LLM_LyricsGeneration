[Verse 1]
I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
She was my woman, I loved her so
But it's too late now, I've let her go
[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
[Verse 2]
We shared the years, we shared each day
In love, together, we found the way
But soon, the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray
[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
[Verse 3]
It took so long to realise
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now, all my days are filled with tears
Wish I could go back and change these years
[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
