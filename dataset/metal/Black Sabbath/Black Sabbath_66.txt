[Verse 1]
Look through the people and on through the mist
To the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet on a night such as this
And the power of darkness is host
[Verse 2]
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul
With an angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air are the screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die
[Chorus]
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross
At the headless cross
[Verse 3]
From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan
On a nation so brave and so proud
[Chorus]
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross
At the headless cross
[Verse 4]
How do you feel when the locks refuse the key
And the master is calling your name?
Does the luck of the charm really keep you from harm?
Does the talisman protect you from pain?
[Chorus]
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross
At the headless cross
[Verse 5]
From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's no escaping from the power of Satan
For a people so brave and so proud
[Chorus]
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross
At the headless cross
[Outro]
At the headless cross
At the headless cross
Where will you run to?
At the headless cross
Look to the headless cross
