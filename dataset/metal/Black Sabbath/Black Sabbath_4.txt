[Instrumental Intro]
[Riff]
[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!
[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Tellin' people their desire
Satan's sittin' there, he's smilin'
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no! No! Please, God, help me!
[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's comin' 'round the bend
People runnin' 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No! No! Please, no!
[Guitar Solo]
