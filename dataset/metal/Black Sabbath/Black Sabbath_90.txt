[Verse 1]
Just before you die
They say you'll see your life go flashing by
Cold dark endless nights
To burn in hell or bathe in heaven's light
[Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna live forever
But I don't want to die...
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie
[Verse 2]
Days pass by too soon
Waiting for the rising of the moon
No escape from here
Facing death, but is your conscience clear?
[Chorus]
I may be dreaming or whatever
Watching my life go by
And I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie
[Outro]
Don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
Don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
