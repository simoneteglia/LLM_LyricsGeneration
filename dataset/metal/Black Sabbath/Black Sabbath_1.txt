[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time
[Verse 2]
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify
[Bridge]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal
[Verse 5]
And so, as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late
