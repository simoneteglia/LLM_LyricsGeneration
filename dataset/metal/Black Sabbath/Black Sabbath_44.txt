[Verse 1]
Too much near the truth they say
Keep it till another day
Let them have their little game
Delusion helps to keep them sane
[Verse 2]
Let them have their little toys
Matchbox cars and mortgaged joys
Exciting in their plastic ways
Frozen food in a concrete maze
[Chorus]
You’re gonna go insane
I’m trying to save your brain
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
All right!
I don’t know what’s happening
My head’s all torn inside
People say I’m heavy
They don’t know what I hide
[Verse 4]
Take a life, it’s going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom’s yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use
[Chorus]
You’re gonna go insane
I’m trying to save your brain
