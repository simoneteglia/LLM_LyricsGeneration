[Verse 1]
Now, the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone
[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
[Verse 2]
You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to love ya
Tell me who have I to blame?
[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Now, the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong
[Interlude]
[Verse 4]
Now, the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
[Chorus]
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong
