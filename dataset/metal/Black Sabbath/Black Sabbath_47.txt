[Verse 1]
Told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking, but they'll never find it
[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright
[Verse 2]
Where to go and where to see?
It's always been that way and it can never be
[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright
[Verse 3]
Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
[Chorus]
That's it's alright, yes, it's alright
[Bridge]
Uh, uhhh-uhh
Uhh-uhh, uh-uh-uhhh
[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through
[Chorus]
But it's alright, yes, it's alright
[Verse 5]
Someone told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
[Chorus]
It's alright, yes, it's alright
[Outro]
Oh, ohhh-oh
Uh, uhhh-uhh
Uh, uhhh-uhh
