[Verse 1]
There's a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the wind won't blow
And they only speak in whispers of her name
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout, she'll search you out
And freeze you where you stand
[Chorus]
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil in my mind
She's the queen of the night
[Verse 2]
In a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the rain won't fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed, yeah
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness
She can't face the light
With an awful shout, she'll find you out
And have you before the night
[Chorus]
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's the queen of the night
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
So if you ever get to Witches' Valley
Don't dream or close your eyes
And never trust your shadow in the dark
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision
And turns it all around
The things you see are what to be, lost and never found
[Chorus]
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's the queen of the night
[Outro]
Gonna do you right
She's the queen of sin
Look out, she'll pull you in!
Lady wonder!
