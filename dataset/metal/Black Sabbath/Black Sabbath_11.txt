[Verse 1]
Reflex in the sky warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you better hide from the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay, radiation, minds decay
[Verse 2]
Robot minds of robot slaves, lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun, fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation, victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
like electric funeral pyre
[Bridge]
Buildings crashing down to earth's cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood, ice melt into blood
Earth lies in deathbed, clouds cry for the dead
Terrifying rain is a burning pain
Electric Funeral, Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral, Electric Funeral
[Verse 3]
And so, in the sky shines the electric eye
Supernatural king takes Earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings, Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to Hell, ever trapped in burning cells
[Instrumental Outro]
