[Verse 1]
Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or youâ€™re going to die
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes
[Bridge]
Good life is contradiction, because of crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seed
[Verse 2]
I've just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You've just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal, unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up the stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers send electric lies, lies
[Chorus]
We're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast?
Do we mind disturbing the priest?
Not at all, not at all, not in the least
Ohhhh!
Do we mind disturbing the priest?
Ohhhh!
Not at all, not at all, not in the least
[Verse 3]
The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set alight
The flames of doubt so deep inside, inside
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and night and day
The force of the devil, that's what we're all told to fear
Watch out for religion or when he gets too near, too near
[Chorus]
We're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast?
Do we mind disturbing the priest?
Not at all, not at all, not in the least
[Bridge]
Good life is contradiction, because of crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I'll take your soul and plant my seed-oh
[Verse 1]
Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
And when he cries, keep looking at the eyes
[Outro]
Oh, oh!
Disturbing the priest
Yeah-ah!
Disturbing the priest
Yeah!
*Laughter*
