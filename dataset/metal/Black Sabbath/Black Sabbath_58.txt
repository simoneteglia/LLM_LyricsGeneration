[Verse 1]
It’s complete, but obsolete
All tomorrows become yesterday
In demand, but second-hand
It’s been heard before you even play, yeah
Up to date, but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You’re so right, but overnight
You’re the one who has to take the blame, yeah
[Bridge]
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can’t believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried?
Yeah-ay-ay-ay, yeah!
[Verse 2]
Don’t delay, you’re in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday’s star is Monday’s scar
Out of date before you’re even seen, yeah
At the top so quick to flop
You’re so new, but rotting in decay
Like butterfly, so quick to die
But you’re only looking for today, yeah
[Bridge]
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can’t believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried?
Yeah-ay-ay-ay, yeah!
[Chorus]
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
[Verse 3]
Listen!
Glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but, oh, how quick it goes
Ten foot tall, but what a fall
Hard to open, yet so easy to close, yeah
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Overpaid, but soon you fade
Because you’re only looking for today, yeah
[Chorus]
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
Looking for today
