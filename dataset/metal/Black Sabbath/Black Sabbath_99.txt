[verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn
And sometimes I'm warm as fire
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
[Chorus]
And it goes over, and over, and over again, yeah
[verse 2]
Too many flames, with too much to burn
And life's only made of paper
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain
[Chorus]
But it goes over, and over, and over, and over again
[guitar solo 1]
[verse 3]
Yeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone
And for their dreams that will all be ashes
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
[Chorus]
And it goes over, and over, and over, and over again
[guitar solo 2]
[outro]
(Over)
(Over)
(Over)
(Again)
