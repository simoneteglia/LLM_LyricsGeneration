[Intro: Tony Iommi]
*Coughing*
[Verse 1]
Alright now
Won't you listen?
When I first met you, didn't realise
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh, yeah!
[Verse 2]
I love you
Oh, you know it
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you, sweet leaf
Though you can't hear
Oh, yeah!
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Come on now
Try it out
Straight people don't know
What you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world
Will love you, sweet leaf
Oh, yeah, baby!
[Outro]
Come on now! Oh, yeah!
Try me out, baby! Alright!
Oh, yeah-ah
I want you part of this sweet leaf
Oh, yeah! Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, try me out
I love you, sweet leaf, oh
