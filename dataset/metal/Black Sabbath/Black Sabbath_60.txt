[Intro]
I think about closing the door
And lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like I'm losing my mind
I should be at the table round
A servant of the crown
The keeper of the sign
To sparkle and to shine
[Verse 1]
Never, no never again!
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can
Never, this is the end
You know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man
Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, oh, take me away
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!
[Chorus]
I've got to be strong
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Look out, there's danger, nowhere to run!
Seems like desperate measures but sometimes it's got to be done
Over, it's over at last
And the message inside as we build a new life from the past
[Chorus]
We're falling off the edge of the world!
Yes, the edge of the world!
It's the end of the world!
