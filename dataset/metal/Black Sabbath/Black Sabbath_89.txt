[Verse 1]
There's a man who sees all there is to see
What the future holds for all
As the days grow dark, was his sole and final warning
Beware of the one with invisible friends
They will steal into your mind
And all too soon the signs begin to show
[Chorus]
Rise up to the shining
Live long, live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
[Verse 2]
As the page is turned and the story's told
Full of visions he had seen
The house on the hill with the haunting eyes that call
No one left as madness came out to play it's game
If you stay too long you'll finally go insane, yeah
[Chorus]
Rise up to the shining
Live long, live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
[Bridge]
Bells will take their toll on your way-oh
There's no way we're born to shine
Before our time, all your life
You're on your own
Lonely road, lost in a time
Let the light lead your way to the golden throne
It's the only way
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Rise up to the shining
Live long, live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Rise up to the shining
Live long, live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
[Outro]
Oh, rise up, to the shining
Rise up, they're gonna steal your mind
Rise up, the house is gonna haunt you
No one laughed, no one cried
You stayed too long
You're finally gonna stay
