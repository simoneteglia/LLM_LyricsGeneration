[Instrumental Intro 00:00-01:05]
[Verse 1]
The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People go to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead
[Verse 2]
A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's gotta go and die
They can put a man on the Moon quite easy
While people here on Earth are dying of old diseases
[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solo 02:00-03:28]
[Verse 3]
A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his father
[Instrumental Outro]
