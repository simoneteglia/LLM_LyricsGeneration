I am anger under pressure
Left in cages, a prisoner
The first to escape
I am wicked
I am legion
Strength in numbers, a lie
The number is one
I, I, I
Everything that I see is for me
Yes, I am giant
I'm a monster
Breaking windows in houses
Buildings of glass
Rebel, rebel, holy outlaw
Ride together, don't try it
The power's in one
I, I, I
I am standing alone
But I can rock you
I, I, I
On the edge of the blade
But the knife can't cut the hero down
I am virgin, I'm a whore
Giving nothing, the taker
The maker of war
I'll smash your face in
But with a smile
All together, you'll never be
Stronger than me
I, I, I
Right here on my own
But I still rock you
I, I, I
Don't follow behind
Just leave me on the outside
I, I, I
I am standing alone
But I can shock you
I, I, I
On the edge of the blade
But no-one makes the hero bleed
No, no, no, no, no, no
I am hunger, no, no, no
Feed my head, no, no, no
All together, you'll never
Never make the hero bleed
No, no, no
