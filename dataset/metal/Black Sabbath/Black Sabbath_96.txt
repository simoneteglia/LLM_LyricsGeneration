[Verse 1]
Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi
Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
Can you see me? Are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
Anno Mundi, can you wonder?
Truth of thunder, life or blame
[Verse 2]
Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh? Put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror? Do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing, they're all laughing at you
If only they could see what you're saying was true, oh yeah
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know? Don't they know?
No, no, no
[Chorus]
As winds of night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Anno Mundi yeah
[Verse 3]
Do you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war? Do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone
[Chorus]
As winds of night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
No, no, no
[Verse 4]
Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi
Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi
Can you see me now? Oh
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
Can you hear me now? Oh
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
(Spiritus Sanctus Anno Anno Mundi)
Runnin' in the rain
Truth of thunder, life or blame
[Verse 5]
There's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn? See a new day begun
No longer the fool, the vision is done
[Chorus]
As winds of night blow cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Your eyes are burning
And the winds of night blow cold
Your eyes are burning
And the sands of our time grow old
Your eyes are burning
