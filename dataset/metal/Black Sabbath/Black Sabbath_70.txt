[Verse 1]
Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel
[Chorus]
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Don't you know that I might be your wishing well?
Your wishing well!
[Verse 2]
Look in the water, tell me what do you see
Reflections of the love you give to me
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
So let me fill myself with tears you cry, and why?
[Bridge]
Time is a never ending journey
Love is a never ending smile
Give me a sign to build a
Dream on, dream on
[Guitar Solo]
(Dream on, dream on)
(Dream on, dream on)
[Verse 3]
Yeah, throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
Let me fill myself with tears you cry
[Chorus]
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say
Dream for a while of the things that make you smile
'Cause you know, don't you know?
Oh, you know that I'm your wishing well
Your wishing well, your wishing well
I wish you well, I'm your wishing well
