[Verse 1]
It's against my uniform
To be a civil judge
All the songs are history now
'Bout rock stars and their grudge
Let us cast our minds back
To thirty years or more
You talk of all the vandals
Well Hitler beat 'em all
[Chorus]
And we're sad and sorry
We're really sorry that it happened that way
Yes, we're so, so sorry
But why'd you have to treat us that way?
[Verse 2]
Compare ourselves with others
And cover them in sin
Oh God what a terrible
A terrible state we're in
There must be some way out of here
A compromise that's right
If we cannot work it out
We're gonna have to fight
[Chorus]
And we're so sorry
We're really sorry that it happened that way
Yes, we're sad and sorry
We cannot go on in those days
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I'm talking about my brothers
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout sisters as well
And I wish you good luck
Good luck
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Oh, but the world's still on fire
(You gotta believe it, you gotta believe it, you better believe it, you gotta believe it)
Chain the hope you take on, liar
(You better believe it, you gotta believe it, you better believe it, you gotta believe it)
This fire
(You gotta believe it, you better believe it, you gotta believe it, you gotta believe it)
We're on fire, we're on fire
(You better believe it, you gotta believe it, you gotta believe it, you gotta believe it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You better believe it, you gotta believe it, you gotta believe it, you gotta believe it...)
