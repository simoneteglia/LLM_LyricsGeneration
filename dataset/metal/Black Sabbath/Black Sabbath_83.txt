[Verse]
The epidemic from a crystal lie
Puts you in super overdrive
The methademic that is so hard to hide
Insanely staring with wide eyes
Hallucinating in a chemical hell
Ain't my idea of having fun
Synthetic overload, you're under its spell
Your super nightmare's just begun
[Chorus]
You try to stop, but it controls you
Your love affair with it won't last
You're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction
And in the end you're gonna crash
[Post-Chorus]
You live too fast
You live too fast
[Bridge]
You look just like a dead man alive
Losing the fight for survival
You sit and wait at hell's fiery gate
Waiting the devil's arrival, ha-ha-ha
[Chorus]
You live so fast, you need more methademic crystal
You never sleep, you just keep goin'
Just push the trigger on your hypodermic pistol
Each time you're dying without knowing
[Post-Chorus]
You live too fast
You live too fast
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
What's the point? It's killing you without you even knowing
I can tell you've sold your soul and hell is where you're going
Ha-ha-ha, I'll see you there
