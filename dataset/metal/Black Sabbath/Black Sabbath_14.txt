[Verse 1]
What you gonna do? Time's caught up with you
Now, you wait your turn, you know there's no return
Take your routine roles, you join the other fools
Turn to something new, now, it's killing you
[Verse 2]
First, it was the bomb, Vietnam, napalm
Disillusioning, you push the needle in
From life, you escape reality's black drape
Colours in your mind satisfy your time
[Bridge 1]
Oh, you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool, now
[Bridge 2]
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you, it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think, now
[Bridge 3]
You're having a good time, baby, but that won't last
Your mind's all full of things, you're living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself, don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you, stick the needle in, yeah
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Now, you know the scene, your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see life's reality
Push the needle in, face Death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin
[Verse 4]
Head starts spinning 'round, you fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave, Death hand starts to weave
It's too late to turn, you don't wanna learn
Price of life you hide, now, you're gonna die
