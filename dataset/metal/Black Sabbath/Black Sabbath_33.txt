[Part I]
[Verse 1]
Feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me loving every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away
[Chorus]
Someone to love me
You know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me
Love me every single night!
[Verse 2]
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman till the end of time
[Chorus]
Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time!
Makes me feel happy
Good to know that she's all mine
[Part II]
[Verse 3]
Lovely lady, make love all night long
Ooh, lovely lady, never do me wrong
Uh, I don’t wanna leave ya
I never wanna leave ya
Anymore
No more
[Verse 4]
Lovely lady, mystifying eyes
Lovely lady, she don’t tell me no lies
I know I’ll never leave ya
I’m never gonna leave you
Anymore
I said no more, I said no more!
[Outro]
Ooh, alright, yeah! Alright now, yeah
No more, yeah! I said, little woman, no more
I said, little woman, no more, I said no more
Ooh, yeah! Come on, now, baby
