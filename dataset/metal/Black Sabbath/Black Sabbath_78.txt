[Verse 1]
A rumble of thunder
I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver
I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover
I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeah
[Verse 2]
Regiment fooled you
You thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation
But that's gone too far
A time of suspension, a special condition
That we all know
So let it all go
[Chorus]
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so right
[Verse 3]
Nighttime sorrow, taken like the pain
Black will not become white
It's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement
Like a fire needs a spark to burn
[Verse 4]
A rumble of thunder
I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver
I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold
[Chorus]
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so bright
[Chorus]
Gotta turn up the night
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
It feels so right
[Outro]
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
Get out the light
Turn up the night
If it feels right
Turn up the night
If it feels right
Shut out the light
Turn up the night
Turn up the night
