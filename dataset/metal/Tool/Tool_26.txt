[Verse 1]
What was it like to see
The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone
Eleven is when we waved goodbye
Eleven is standing still (Waiting for me)
Waiting for me to free him by
Coming home
[Verse 2]
Moving me with a sound
Opening me within a gesture
Drawing me down and in
(Showing me where it all began)
Showing me where it all began
Eleven
He was too scarred to realize
You were the voice that's been calling me back home
[Verse 3]
Under a dead Ohio sky
Eleven has been and will be waiting
Defending his light and wondering
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb, I'm
So glad that I have found you
I am wide awake and heading home
[Bridge]
I wish that I could see you
Turn and run to play
Dreams are fading
Carry my ancient soul
Carry me into the light
Aim your body heavenly
Enduring a memory
I'll come to your light
Hold your light where I can see it
High
[Verse 4]
Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory, I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together
Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory
until
One and one are one, eleven
So glow, child, glow
I'm heading back home
