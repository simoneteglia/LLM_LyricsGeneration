[Intro]
Join in my—
Join in, my child, and listen
Digging through
My old numb shadow
[Verse 1]
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking scabs again
I'm down, digging through
My old muscles, looking for a clue
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in
I wanna feel the changes coming down
I wanna know what I've been hiding
[Chorus 1]
In my shadow
My shadow
Change is coming through
My shadow
My shadow
Shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again
[Spoken]
Join in my—
Join in my child
My shadow's
Closer to meaning
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
Insecure delusions
I wanna feel the change consume me
Feel the outside turning in
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured in
[Chorus 2]
My shadow
My shadow
Change is coming
Now is my time
Listen to my muscle memory
Contemplate what I've been clinging to
Forty-six and two ahead of me
[Bridge]
I choose to live and to grow
Take and give and to move
Learn and love and to cry
Kill and die and to be
Paranoid and to lie
Hate and fear and to do
What it takes to move through
I choose to live and to lie
Kill and give and to die
Learn and love and to do
What it takes to step through
[Interlude]
[Outro]
See my shadow changing
Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way by
Stepping through my shadow
Coming out the other side
Step into the shadow
Forty six and two are just ahead of me
