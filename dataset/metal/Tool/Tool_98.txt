[Hook]
Spec-Spec-Spectro Spectros on
Sp-Sp-Spectros on, yeah Spectros on
Spectros on,
Yeah I'm that dude
(Girl girl wanna get tool time screwed)
Wanna 69 Me?
Yeah I can tell
(Turned to the hammer then she turned to the nail)
[Verse 1]
Ok Spectros on yeah, I'm that dude
Flow nasty like old folks nude
And I'm so rude, cuss like a sailor
All Star flow, call me "Chuck Taylor"
And I go in, no pen, no paper
Had to do a second mixtape for the haters
Jerkin Can't Die, won't die, or will be
Even if you never touch me, you'll feel me
She heard 69 me yeah I could tell
'Cuz I turn to the hammer and she turns to the nail
And of course I beat it up like Ike or Chris
No bathroom but I'm the shit
Just got some brand new gear from the store
And they gave me 3 shoes but I still want more
I'm addicted,
fly, never ugly
No I don't dance but I hit 'em with my dougie, yeah
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Ok Spectros on, they feelin' my song
From LA all the way to Hong Kong
Brand new shoes I'm airplane fly
Yeah
I'm the one like 10 minus 9
No ice but she wanna chill all night
'Cuz her boyfriend left and I seen her do it right
Got fresh in my Nikes, shoe game sick
I'm the bomb no tick, chain, golden wrist
Beef 'cuz I might just take yo chick
She party like me but she love my kicks
Brand new Vlados poppin', acne
Number 1 runnin' this track, track meet
Got game on lock, been on for a minute
Makin' jerk songs, never shall I finish, I'm a menace
I'm addicted, fly, never ugly
No I don't dance but I hit 'em with my dougie, yeah
[Hook]
