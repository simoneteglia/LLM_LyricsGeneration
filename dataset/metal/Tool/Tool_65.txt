[Instrumental Intro]
[Chorus]
Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant? Oh..
[Verse]
Time heals, time congeals around us
Endless hours of wasted moments
Understanding's not demanding
Your eyes tell what you feel inside
[Chorus]
Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant?
[Outro]
You lied!
