[Intro: Tooley]
(
Ayy, run that shit up, Chase
)
Ayy
Ayy
[Chorus: Tooley]
Ain't no more car hoppin' and kickin' doors, I walk in buyin' shit
Deserve a plaque the way I work that vacuum seal, I'm too legit
Ho from high school hit my DM, I just left the bitch on read
Used to throw me curveballs, now it's why I ain't text her yet?
Ain't no trap spot, we got bags in the loft
Designer fabric, far from regular, this shit on me cost
Just put VVs in my mouth, I could've put down on a house
Took real risks for this, ain't doin' no tusslin', I'm shooting your ass down
[Verse 1: Tooley]
Can't believe you tried to "Sorry, baby," that's the past tense
Shot at you some years back, you played, bitch, it's over with
Twenty raw, VVSs, crack a smile, Aquafina
Sit back, I'm sippin' Keke Palmer, purple turn me to a demon
Scratch off in that Benz coupe, Palm Angels sweatsuit twenty blues
One too many times, I feel it's tension, chopper shake the room
Married to the streets, gift and a curse, but I'll still jump the broom
Seventy-five an eight, this ain't no zaza, this that silver spoon top shelf
I lied, keep pourin' up, hope I ain't fuckin' up my health
Just me and fifty shots, I'll clear this bitch out by myself
Got tired of hitting the road for it, told the plug just send it here
Collect calls ain't enough time, free my nigga out that jail
[Chorus: Tooley]
Ain't no more car hoppin' and kickin' doors, I walk in buyin' shit
Deserve a plaque the way I work that vacuum seal, I'm too legit
Ho from high school hit my DM, I just left the bitch on read
Used to throw me curveballs, now it's why I ain't text her yet?
Ain't no trap spot, we got bags in the loft
Designer fabric, far from regular, this shit on me cost
Just put VVs in my mouth, I could've put down on a house
Took real risks for this, ain't doin' no tusslin', I'm shooting your ass down
[Verse 2: Pooh Shiesty]
My draco clip stay fully loaded, I keep one off in the head
Big Shiesty the don dada, still won't answer to the feds
On my side it's code and regulations, you know how we play it
Two hundred thousand, all hundreds, I made this shit off the med
I made all this shit out the trap, exotic 'bows flow in and out
Go get the ho out the suburbs and make her post up in the South
Johnny Dang inside a white bitch, it's 90K in my mouth
The ATF ran in the spot, took like 90K out the couch (On God)
Oh, we lit, we stuck for life, still the same niggas from the South (We rich, we lit 4L)
We vacuum seal all the packs, make sure that the smell ain't leaking out (Make sure you hide that smell)
Addicted to that Wock', tap in with me when I'm up in your town (Tap in, you need the seal)
We ain't no rookies, I ain't no Ja Morant, twelve shots gon' shut him down, blrrrd
[Chorus: Tooley]
Ain't no more car hoppin' and kickin' doors, I walk in buyin' shit
Deserve a plaque the way I work that vacuum seal, I'm too legit
Ho from high school hit my DM, I just left the bitch on read
Used to throw me curveballs, now it's why I ain't text her yet?
Ain't no trap spot, we got bags in the loft
Designer fabric, far from regular, this shit on me cost
Just put VVs in my mouth, I could've put down on a house
Took real risks for this, ain't doin' no tusslin', I'm shooting your ass down
