[Intro: Timothy Leary]
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we're going in this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities Who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality
To think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness;
Chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself, question authority
Think for yourself
Think for yourself
Order, regulations, rules
Think for yourself, question authority
Order, regulations, rules, comfort us
[Verse 1]
Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes
[Verse 2]
On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye
[Refrain]
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out, in, out
In, out
[Verse 3]
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along
[Chorus 1]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?
[Bridge]
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
Blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
Pull the pieces from the sand
Try to attempt to reassemble
See just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song
[Chorus 1]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why you running away?
[Post-Chorus]
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
[Chorus 2]
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing the tail of dogma
[Pre-Chorus]
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were
[Chorus 2]
So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and reason
[Post-Chorus/Outro]
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
