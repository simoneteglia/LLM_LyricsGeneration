[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be hostile
I don't wanna be dismal
And I don't wanna rot in an apathetic existence
See, I wanna believe you
And I wanted to trust you
And I wanna have faith to put away the dagger
[Chorus]
But you lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
And I tolerate you
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
I cannot tolerate
[Verse 2]
Veil of virtue hung to hide your method
While I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your praise and glory
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
As I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your glory while
[Chorus]
You lie, cheat, and steal
Lie, cheat, and steal
Lie, cheat, and steal
How can I tolerate you?
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
I cannot tolerate
[Verse 3]
Our guilt, our blame, I've been far too sympathetic
Our blood, our fault, I've been far too sympathetic
I am not innocent
I am not innocent
You are not innocent
No one is innocent
[Bridge]
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
You lie, cheat, and steal
I cannot tolerate
[Outro]
I will not tolerate you
I will go down beside you
I must go down beside you
No one is innocent
