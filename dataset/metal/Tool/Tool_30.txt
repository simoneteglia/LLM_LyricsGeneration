[Verse 1]
Here from the king's mountain view
Here from the wild dream come true
Feast like a sultan, I do
On treasures and flesh never few
[Chorus]
But I, I would wish it all away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day
[Verse 2]
The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck, soon to drown
But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me 'round
[Chorus]
So I, I, I, I
I would, I would, I would wish this all away
[Verse 3]
Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long
Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along
[Chorus]
But I, I would
If I could, then I would
Wish it away, wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away
No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away my center
[Verse 4]
So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away
You, my peace of mind, my all, my center
Just tryin' to hold on one more day
Damn my eyes, damn my eyes
Damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum
If wants and needs divide me, then I might as well be gone
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun
Shine down upon the broken
Shine until the two become one
Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun
Shine down upon the severed
Shine until the two become one
Divided, withering away
Divided, withering away
Shine down upon the many
Light our way, benevolent sun
[Outro]
Breathe in union, breathe in union
Breathe in union, breathe in union
Breathe in union, so as one, survive
Another day and season
Silence, legion, save your poison
Silence, legion, stay out of my way
