[Intro]
​​​​​​
dwilly, I'm scared
[Chorus: 1nonly]
I've been riding 'round, with this
toolie beam
Word around town, I'm breakin' necks and shootin' things
C-call me outside bitch, I'm looking where ya at?
Posted creepin' wit' a .9, I got a chrome, upgrade the gat like
[Post-Chorus: 1nonly]
Open, open up, PCP and beans
Where the double cup? Double dutch
Posted at your spot, make them bullets jump, leave 'em stuck
I've seen you around for a minute, why you trippin'?
Hold it, I got plenty rounds for you bitches
[Chorus: 1nonly]
I've been riding 'round, with this toolie beam
Word around town, I'm breakin' necks and shootin' things
C-call me outside bitch, I'm looking wherе ya at?
Posted creepin' wit' a .9, I got a chrome, upgrade thе gat like
[Verse 1: Pouya]
Yeah, my only role model was a liquor bottle (Bottle)
I was prayin' but my mama never hit the lotto (Lotto)
Waiting for my Kodak, picture perfect moment, baby bone
Had to get off my ass and grip that chrome, and then get in my zone, yuh
Tell these hoes all around me to leave me the fuck alone
I'm 'bout my bread like ducks, ain't 'bout that paper, don't hit my phone
I've been sedated, isolated in my desolate room
Slit my wrist and fall into the black abyss, that is my tomb
Impending doom, looms around my mind I smell the fumes
Coming from my head, the reaper said, "Can't wait to meet you soon"
[Verse 2: 1nonly]
Ayy, ayy, I got that toolie on me
Getting up out my seat and breakin' the seal, what's the deal?
Soul keep burning the sheep, it is hiding my death in these mils
Why is you speaking to me, if your bank it not flooded?
Might push up and pop wit' the steal
He do the most, I get the bag and I go, I shoot not to hurt but to kill, like
Got blue hunnids on me bitch, she fucking on me, get a grip
You need to run it home, say you 'bout it show me, here's a tip
Wanna one up on me? Make a hit and blow up
Then go get a fuckin' bag and flip it, give me what you owe me
[Chorus: 1nonly]
I've been riding 'round, with this toolie beam
Word around town, I'm breakin' necks and shootin' things
C-call me outside bitch, I'm looking where ya at?

Open, open up, PCP and beans
Where the double cup? Double dutch
Posted at your spot, make them bullets jump, leave 'em stuck
I've seen you around for a minute, why you trippin'?
Hold it, I got plenty rounds for you bitches
[Chorus: 1nonly]
I've been riding 'round, with this toolie beam (Beam)
Word around town, I'm breakin' necks and shootin' things (Things)
C-call me outside bitch, I'm looking where ya at?
Posted creepin' wit' a .9, I got a chrome, upgrade the gat like (Like-like-like)
