[Intro]
Fuck you
[Verse 1]
I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm not serious
I can't say what I want to
Even if I'm not serious
Things like
Fuck yourself, fuck yourself
You piece of shit, why don't you just go kill yourself?
[Chorus]
I said
I can't say what I want to, even if I'm not serious
I can't say what I want to, even if I'm just kidding
[Verse 2]
People tell me what to say
What to think and what to play
I said, people tell me what to say
What to think, and what to play
Things like fuck yourself
Fuck yourself
You piece of shit, why don't you just go kill yourself?
[Chorus]
I said
I can't say what I want to, even if I'm not serious
I can't say what I want to, even if I'm just kidding
[Bridge]
Fuck yourself
Fuck yourself
You piece of shit
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
[Verse 3]
People tell me what to say
What to think, and what to play
I said, people tell me what to say
What to think and what to play
[Outro]
Just kidding
Just kidding
I'm just kidding
