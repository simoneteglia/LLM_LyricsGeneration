[Monolouge: Maynard James Keenan]
We've been, we've been trying something
A little different this tour
We've been looking at one of our songs
From a different angle, under a different light
So we can hopefully kind of
See it almost for the first time
We'd like to try that for you tonight, is that okay?
We're gonna need your help though
We need your help and your permission
So we need you to find a comfortable space
That's not only comfortable, but vulnerable
And to just shut your eyes and go there
And we'll meet you on the other side...
[Intro]
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do we both may disappear
If I do we both may disappear
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you as well, my dear
And you as well
Pushed you away, my dear
Pushed you away
Pushed you away
Pushed you away, my dear
[Verse 1]
I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What are you but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
[Refrain]
But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you
[Verse 2]
Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You'd better take care not to make me enter
If I do we both may disappear
If I do we both may disappear
[Refrain]
But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you
[Chorus]
You still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And we're pushing, and I'm shoving
And you still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And I'm pushing, and you're shoving me
[Verse 3]
And I'm slipping back into
The gap again
I feel alive when you touch me
I feel alive when you hold me
Down
Slipping back into
Slipping back into
[Bridge]
I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never wanna see that place again
[Verse 4]
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you as well, my dear
If when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way
Pushing and shoving
And pushing and shoving
And pushing me
There's no love in fear
[Outro]
Staring down the hole again
Hands are on my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come
Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way
It will end no other way
