[Verse 1]
Who are you to wave your
finger
?
You must've been out your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead
Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
Don't go tossin' your stones around
You must've been high
You must've been high
You must've been
[Bridge 1]
Foot in mouth and head up ass
So whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'Til you pull it out, boy
You must've been so high
You must've been so high
[Verse 2]
Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high
You must've been high, high
[Verse 3]
Who are you to wave your
finger
? So full of it
Eye balls deep in muddy waters, fuckin' hypocrite
Liar, lawyer, mirror, show me what's the difference?
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been
[Bridge 2]
So who are you to wave your
finger
?
Who are you to wave your
fatty fingers
at me?
You must have been out your mind
Weepin' shades of indigo
Shed without a reason
Weepin' shades of indigo
[Verse 4]
Liar, lawyer, mirror for ya, what's the difference?
Kangaroo be stoned, he's guilty as the government
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
Now when you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high, high, high
[Outro]
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
You're balls deep in muddy waters
Ganja? Please!
You must have been out your mind
