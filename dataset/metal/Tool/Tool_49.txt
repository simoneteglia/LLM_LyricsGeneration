[Verse 1]
Pure as we begin
Pure as we come in
Pure as we begin
Move by will alone
[Verse 2]
Pure as we begin
Here we have a stone
Gather, place and raise, so
Shelter turns to home
[Verse 3]
Pure as we begin
Here we have a stone
Throw to stay the stranger
Swore to crush his bones
[Chorus]
Move by will alone
[Verse 4]
Spark becomes a flame
Flame becomes a fire
Light the way or warm this
Home we occupy
[Verse 5]
Spark becomes a flame
Flame becomes a fire
Forge a blade to slay the stranger
Take whatever we desire
[Chorus]
Move by will alone
Pure as we begin
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Pure as we begin
Move by will alone
Leave as we come in
Pure as light, return to one
Move by will alone
Move by will alone
