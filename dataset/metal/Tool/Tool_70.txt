[Verse 1]
I'm sweating
And breathing
And staring and thinking
And sinking
Deeper
And it's almost like I'm swimming
The sun is burning hot again
On the hunter
And the fisherman
And I'm trying to remember when
But it makes me dizzy
[Chorus]
Seems like I've been here before
Seems so familiar
Seems like I'm slipping
Into a dream within a dream
It's the way you whisper
[Verse 2]
The sun is setting cool again
I'm a thinker
And a fisherman
And I'm trying to remember when
But it makes me dizzy
And I'm sweating
And breathing
And staring and thinking
And sinking deeper
And it's almost like I'm swimming
[Chorus]
Seems like I've been here before
Seems so familiar
Seems like I'm slipping
Into a dream within a dream
It's the way you whisper
Drags me under
Takes me home
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Seems like I've been here before
Seems so familiar
Seems like I'm slipping
Into a dream within a dream
It's the way you whisper
Drags me under
Takes me home
