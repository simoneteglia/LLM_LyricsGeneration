[Intro]
“Throw that Bob-Marley-wannabe motherfucker out of here”
[Refrain]
Fade
[Verse 1]
Underneath the skin and jewelry
Hidden in her words and eyes
Is a wall that's cold and ugly
And she's scared as hell
[Chorus]
Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her
'Cause she's scared as hell
I am frightened too
I am frightened
Oh no, oh-oh
[Chorus]
Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her
'Cause she's scared as hell
I am frightened too
I am frightened
[Bridge]
Wide awake and
Keeping distance from my soul
Wide awake and
Keeping distance from my soul
[Refrain]
Fade
[Verse 1]
Underneath the skin and jewelry
Hidden in her words and eyes
Is a wall that's cold and ugly
And she's scared as hell
[Chorus]
Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her
'Cause she's scared as hell
I am frightened too
I am frightened too
I am scared like you
I am frightened
