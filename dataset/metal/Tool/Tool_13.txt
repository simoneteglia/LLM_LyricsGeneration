[Verse 1]
It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then
You know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Got my hands bound
And my head down and my eyes closed
My throat's wide open
[Refrain]
Do unto others what has been done to me
Do unto others what has been done to you
[Verse 2]
I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr, you look so precious
Won't you, won't you come on a bit closer?
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Release in sodomy
For one sweet moment I am whole
[Refrain]
Do unto you now what has been done to me
Do unto you now what has been done
[Verse 3]
You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise
Won't you, won't you come on a bit closer?
Close enough so I can smell you
I need you to feel this
I need this to make me whole
Release in sodomy
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted?
And only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind
[Verse 4]
Got your hands bound
And your head down
And your eyes closed
You look so precious now
[Bridge]
I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit, blood, and cum on my hands
I've come 'round full circle
[Outro]
My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon
You look so precious, you look so precious
You look so precious, you look so precious
You look so precious now
You look so precious
