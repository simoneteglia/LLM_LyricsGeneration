[Verse]
We barely remember
Who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside
[Pre-Chorus]
This holy reality
This holy experience
Choosing to be here in
[Chorus]
This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me
Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion
[Post-Chorus]
Alive
[Pre-Chorus]
In this holy reality
In this holy experience
Choosing to be here in
[Chorus]
This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in
This body, this body holding me
Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion
[Bridge]
Twirling 'round with this familiar parable
Spinning, weaving 'round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and
Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
A chance to be alive and breathing
[Outro]
This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality
Embrace this moment, remember
We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion
