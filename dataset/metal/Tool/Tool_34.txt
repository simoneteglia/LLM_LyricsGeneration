[Part I: Opiate]
[Intro]
Choices always were a problem for you
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Like me
Like me
Like me
Like me
[Verse 1]
If you want to get your soul to Heaven
Trust in me now, don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do
[Chorus]
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
What you need is someone strong to guide you
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you
[Post-Chorus]
My God's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you
[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
[Verse 2]
If you want to get your soul to Heaven
Trust in me, now don't you judge or question
You are broken now, but faith can heal you
Just do everything I tell you to do
[Chorus]
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now?
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow
Let me lay my holy hand up, hand upon you
[Post-Chorus]
My God's will
Becomes me
When he speaks
He speaks through me
He has needs
Like I do
We both want
To rape you
[Part II: The Gaping Lotus Experience]
[Verse 1]
I had a friend once, he took some acid
Now he thinks he's a fire engine
It's okay until he pisses on your lighter
Kinda smells, kinda cool, kinda funny anyway
[Refrain]
Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan
[Verse 2]
I had a friend once, he took some ecstasy
Tried to marry me and every one in the room
He was sort of loving, kinda caring
Kinda tried to fuck my La-Z-Boy
It got a bit messy all over the curtains
Arm chair covers, throw pillows, and carpeting
[Outro]
I'm getting bored, I'm getting bored
I'm getting bored, I'm getting bored
I'm getting bored, I'm getting bored
I'm getting bored, I'm getting bored
