[Intro]
I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear
[Verse 1]
Know that I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
[Chorus]
But you're
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me
You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me
[Verse 2]
Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You better take care not to make me enter
'Cause if I do, we both may disappear
[Chorus]
But you're
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
You still love me, you still love me
But you didn't need to push it on me
You're pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
[Verse 3]
I'm slipping back into the gap again
I'm alive when you're touching me
Alive when you're shoving me down, yeah
But I'd trade it all
For just a little peace of mind
[Chorus]
Push it on me, push it on me
Push it on me, push it on me
You're pushing, and shoving, and scrambling
To keep my feet flat on the ground
[Bridge]
I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
You put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never want to see that place again
[Verse 4]
Saw that gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you, as well, my dear
And if when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way
[Outro]
Pushing and shoving
Pushing and shoving
Pushing me
There's no love in fear
Yeah, I'm staring down the hole again
Hands around my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come, yeah
Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way
It will end no other way
