[Intro]
Here comes the water
[Verse 1]
All I knew
All I believed
Crumbling images
No longer comfort me
Scramble to
Reach higher ground
Order and sanity
Something to comfort me
[Chorus]
Take what is mine, hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, bury what's mine
Soon the water will come and claim what is mine
I must leave it behind and climb to a new place now
[Post-Chorus]
This ground is not the rock I thought it to be
[Verse 2]
Thought I was high
Thought I was free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny
I was wrong
This changes everything
[Bridge]
Running away
Running away now
Running away
Running away now
Running away
Running away
[Chorus]
Take what is mine, hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, bury what's mine
Soon the water will come and claim what is mine
I must leave it behind and climb to a new place
The water is rising up on me
Said the water rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead
[Outro]
Grounds break down right under me
Cleanse and purge me in the water
