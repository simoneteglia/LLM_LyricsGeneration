When you get that check, spread that cash
When you get that check
Ooh
When you get that check, spread that cash
Yeah
[Chorus: Quavo &
Takeoff
]
When you get that check, ooh, spread that cash, yeah, yeah
She don't need no man, she got OnlyFans, yeah, yeah
I just stuffed a stick in my brand new pants, yeah, yeah
He didn't take the stand, straight out the can, he straight to bands, yeah (Hey)
So much stain on this Glock, mmm
She been through pain, she ain't no thot, mmm (She been through pain)
Is it jealousy, is it not? Mmm (You tell me)
Nothin' but money on my mind, mmm (
Takeoff
)
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
12 comin' to raid the spot, clear it out (12)
Got the drop from one of your thots, she showed the spot and he got popped
Frank Lucas mink, six tails, it's a fox (Fox)
Pourin' up drank 'cause it's still in stock (Drank)
Skeleton Cartier, see through the clock
Parkin' my yacht with the plug on the dock
We got the streets, they still on lock (Still)
I can make a mill' off top (Mill')
You saw me and lookin' in shock
You know I'm in the club with the Glock
Chrome on the jeans (Chrome), fuck it (Fuck it), I put the chrome on your heart (Brr)
I cuddle and talk to the bag at night, nothing can break us apart (Never)
I can make the back arch, just like the pussy, make the bag fart (How?)
The chains and change the only thing changed, I've been this way from the start (Still)
New money, I like it blue (Hundreds)
I take a bitch to Peru (Phew)
Let her drink out a fruit
She brought a friend, that came with two (Twins)
Now back on the subject
We ballin' on niggas, they thought it was gon' be an upset (No)
They look at us like
leprechauns
, like, "Damn, them niggas ain't run out of luck yet?" (No)
All of the obstacles and all the opposition and they still ain't give up yet? (No)
Lookin' at my net worth, how 'bout you go get you a check first? (Get it)
[Chorus: Quavo]
When you get that check, ooh, spread that cash, yeah, yeah
She don't need no man, she got OnlyFans, yeah, yeah
I just stuffed a stick in my brand new pants, yeah, yeah
He didn't take the stand, straight out the can, he straight to bands, yeah (Hey)
So much stain on this Glock, mmm
She been through pain, she ain't no thot, mmm (She been through pain)
Is it jealousy, is it not? Mmm (You tell me)
Nothin' but money on my mind, mmm
[Verse 2: Quavo]
Never down bad, we breakin' bags, mmm (Bags)
Build it up to a paper tag, mmm (Skrr)
Dedicated to that dirty cash, mmm (Dedicated)
Is you jealousy, is you mad? Mmm (Su, su, su, su)
Fuck a thot, bitch, we look for top shelf, yeah, yeah
We'll set the trend, then we on somethin' else, yeah, yeah
Eat it up, here go the full course chef (Yeah, eat it up)
He fuckin' up the profit, then he back to steppin' (Yes, sir)
How be playin' in the field with the stripes and refs? (Ooh, stripes)
This shit solid, move in silence, quiet as kept (Yeah, yeah)
I left that money sittin', it's pilin' by itself (Watch it pile)
I left that money sittin', it's pilin' by itself
[Chorus: Quavo]
When you get that check, ooh, spread that cash, yeah, yeah
She don't need no man, she got OnlyFans, yeah, yeah
I just stuffed a stick in my brand new pants, yeah, yeah
He didn't take the stand, straight out the can, he straight to bands, yeah (Hey)
So much stain on this Glock, mmm
She been through pain, she ain't no thot, mmm (She been through pain)
Is it jealousy, is it not? Mmm (You tell me)
Nothin' but money on my mind, mmm
