[Verse 1]
Eye on the TV, 'cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be like
"Killed by the husband"
"Drowned by the ocean"
"Shot by his own son"
"She used a poison in his tea
Then kissed him goodbye"
That's my kind of story
It's no fun 'til someone dies
Don't look at me like I am a monster
Frown out your one face, but with the other
Stare like a junkie into the TV
Stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child
Watches him die
Hands to the sky cryin', "Why, oh why?"
[Chorus]
'Cause I need to watch things die
From a distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all need it too, don't lie
[Verse 2]
Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
Neither the brave nor bold
Nor brightest of stories told
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
[Chorus]
I need to watch things die
From a good safe distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same, so
Why can't we just admit it?
[Bridge]
Blood like rain come down
Drum on grave and ground
Part vampire, part warrior
Carnivore and voyeur
Stare at the transmittal
Sing to the death rattle
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
[Verse 3]
Credulous at best, your desire to believe in
Angels in the hearts of men
Pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen
Shouldn't have to say it all again
The universe is hostile, so impersonal
Devour to survive, so it is, so it's always been
[Outro]
We all feed on tragedy
It's like blood to a vampire
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
Much better you than I
