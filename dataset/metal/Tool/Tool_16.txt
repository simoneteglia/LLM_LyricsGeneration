[Verse 1]
Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in
[Pre-Chorus]
Warrior struggling to remain consequential
[Chorus]
Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am
[Verse 2]
Beating chest and drums
Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine
Weapon out and belly in
[Interlude]
Tales told of battles won
Of things we've done
Caligula would grin
[Verse 3]
Beating tired bones
Tripping through remember when
Once invincible
Now the armor's wearing thin
Heavy shield down
[Pre-Chorus]
Warrior struggling to remain relevant
Warrior struggling to remain consequential
[Chorus]
Cry aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am
Where I end
[Pre-Chorus]
Warrior struggling to remain relevant
Warrior struggling to remain consequential
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Refrain]
Tears in my eyes
Chasing Ponce de Leon's phantoms
So filled with hope
I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps
But the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting
Feeling time bearing down
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
Tears in my eyes
Chasing Ponce de Leon's phantoms
So filled with hope
I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps
But the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting
Feeling time bearing down
[Outro]
False hope, perhaps
But the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting
Feeling time bearing down
Bearing down
