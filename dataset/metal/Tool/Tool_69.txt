[Verse 1]
Lock all the doors and kill the lights
No one's coming home tonight
The sun beats down and don't you know?
All our lives are growing cold, oh
They bring news that must get through
Dying dreams in me and you, oh
They're locked in a place where no one goes
[Chorus]
We ask no quarter, we hold no quarter, hey-oh
[Verse 2]
Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight
[Bridge]
It's getting colder, it's getting colder
It's getting colder, it's getting colder
It's getting colder, it's getting colder
Well, it's getting colder
I'm locked in a place where no one goes
[Verse 3]
Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight
[Verse 4]
They'll have news that must get through
Dying dreams in me and you, oh
They're locked in a place where no one goes
They have no quarter, we have no quarter, we ask no quarter
[Chorus]
They have no quarter, we have no quarter, we ask no quarter
