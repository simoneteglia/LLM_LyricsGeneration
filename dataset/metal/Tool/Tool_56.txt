Come on out, come on out
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I don't mean to play here
Figure out, figure out
What you know? What you know?
Figure out how to say it clear
'Cause you’re more likely to get cut with a dull tool
Than a sharp one
You, you stuck around
You stuck around
You stuck around
Until you got me
Then, then you dropped me
[Hook]
You don't kiss when you kiss
You don't fuck when you fuck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk loud enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible
You forgot the difference between equanimity and passivity
You forgot you have to try, you have to try, you have to try
You forgot that glorious feeling that you get when you get the truth
So tell that girl you don't love her
And if you do, tell her two times
'Cause you're more likely to get cut with a dull tool
Than a sharp one
You don't kiss when you kiss
You don't fuck when you fuck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible when
You don’t kiss when you kiss
You don’t fuck when you fuck
You don’t say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible
You don't kiss when you kiss
You don't fuck when you fuck
You don't say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible when
You don’t kiss when you kiss
You don’t fuck when you fuck
You don’t say what you mean
You don't talk, not enough
No pulse in your impulse
Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible
Celebration's impossible
