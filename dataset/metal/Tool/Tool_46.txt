Opens up and lets the wind lift him away
It doesn't have to feel a woman
It's just a place that feels right with him
I kinda like the way you're breathing
I kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to glide on
Slide a mile six inches at a time

There's a shyness found in reason
Apprehensive influence swallow away
You seem to feel abysmal take it
In your careful grace for sure
Kinda like the way you're breathing
Kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to glide on
Glide a mile six inches at a time on
Maynard's dick
Maynard's dick
Maynard's dick
Maynard's dick, yeah

Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Knock you right on top of your forehead
Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Now you know what you're fucking with
Maynard's dick
Maynard's dick
Maynard's dick
Maynard's dick, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
