[Intro]
"Used to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here. But we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach."
[Verse 1]
Someone told me once that there's a right and wrong
Punishment was sure for those who dare to cross the line
But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you, and
Maybe it takes longer
To catch a total asshole
But I'm tired of waiting
[Verse 2]
Someone told me once that there's a right and wrong
Punishment was sure for those who dare to cross the line
But it must not be true
For jerk-offs just like you, and
Maybe it's just bullshit
I should play God
And shoot you myself
Tired of waiting, oh
[Verse 3]
Consequences dictate
Our course of action and it
Doesn't matter what's right
It's only wrong if you get caught
If consequences dictate
My course of action, I should
I should play God and just
Shoot you myself
Tired of waiting
[Outro]
Die, die
Shoot it
Kick it
Fuck it
Shoot you in your fucking head
