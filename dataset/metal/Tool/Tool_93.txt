[Verse 1]
I'm crazy, but I do know what to do
I feel like I have got a screw loose
There’s just one thing to do and that's to tighten it up with you
I wanna be your everything
You need a fix, I got just the thing
You need some help, I can lend a hand
Just let me be your handy man
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a leak, I can stop it
You got a hole, I can fill it
You got a crack, let me seal it
You need to screw
[Chorus]
I wanna be a tool for you
I wanna be the one you use
You know I'll be a tool for you, tool for you, tool for you
’Cause baby, I'm a fool for you, yeah
[Verse 2]
In power tools, I pick the rules
In power games, I always lose
No need to rush and no need to panic
'Cause baby, I can be your mechanic
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a leak, I can stop it
You got a hole, I can fill it
You got a crack, let me seal it
You need a screw?
[Chorus]
I wanna be a tool for you
I wanna be the one you use
You know I'll be a tool for you, tool for you, tool for you
'Cause baby, I'm a fool for you, yeah
[Bridge]
I'm a tool for you, I'm a tool for you
Use me, use me, baby
(I wanna be) I wanna be, I wanna be, I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
I wanna be for you
I wanna be, I wanna be, I (I wanna be a tool)
I wanna be, I wanna be, I
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
A tool for you
[Chorus]
Tool for you
I wanna be the one you use
You know I’ll be a tool for you, tool for you, tool for you
’Cause baby, I'm a fool for you, yeah
