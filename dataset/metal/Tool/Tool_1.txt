[Verse 1]
There's a shadow just behind me
Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the
finger
rests
Murder now the pattern, must we
Just because the son has come
[Pre-Chorus
]
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past and done?
[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over
[Verse 2]
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down
[Pre-Chorus]
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past and done?
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past and done?
[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
[Bridge]
I am just a worthless liar
I am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
Trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me, trust me
[Chorus]
Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over
[Outro]
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
