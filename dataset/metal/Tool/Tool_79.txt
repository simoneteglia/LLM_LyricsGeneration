[Chorus]
"Where'd you get the tool?"
I just got it from the store
It was $3.75, now you saw it, now you die
"Please don't hurt me", I don't care, now say goodbye
Start to count your fuckin' blessings
Now your soul's in the sky
[Verse]
I like brain, I'm insane
And I'm here to take your reign
I'm the king, Freddie sing
Watch your body slowly swing
Wore a ring just because, and I'm fucking with the Bloods
You a dud, ain't my bud
Blood flowing like a flood
Two-tone, hollow tips
I'm the devil, you's a bitch
Tell me you ain't with the shits
Freddie threw a fucking fit
When I tie you up you acting silly, you insane
Beggin', pleadin' for your life
I cannot hear what you are saying
Crying way too god damn much
You are such a fucking lame
Talking all that stupid shit
Until that Freddie's in your lane
Look at my shiny hammer
I think I'ma name it slammer
Bash into your head
Now you dead
Time to go to bed
[Chorus]
"Where'd you get the tool?"
I just got it from the store
It was $3.75, now you saw it, now you die
"Please don't hurt me", I don't care, now say goodbye
Start to count your fuckin' blessings
Now your soul's in the sky
"Where'd you get the tool?"
I just got it from the store
It was $3.75, now you saw it, now you die
"Please don't hurt me", I don't care, now say goodbye
Start to count your fuckin' blessings
Now your soul's in the sky
