[Verse]
I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s
And a dope Beastie tee, nipple rings, new tattoos
That claimed that he was OGT
Back from '92, from the first EP
And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Layin' down, suckin' up to the man
[Chorus]
Well now, I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger, you should know that I'm the man
I'm the man and you're the man and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
[Post-Chorus]
All you know about me is what I've sold ya, dumb fuck
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
And then you bought one
[Chorus]
I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger, you should know that I'm the man
If I'm the fuckin' man, then you're the fuckin' man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass
[Post-Chorus]
All you know about me is what I've sold ya, dumb fuck
I sold out long before you'd ever even heard my name
I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit
And then you bought one
[Outro]
All you read and wear or see and hear on TV
Is a product begging for your fat-ass, dirty dollar
Shut up and buy, buy, buy my new record
And buy, buy, buy, send more money
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
Fuck you, buddy
