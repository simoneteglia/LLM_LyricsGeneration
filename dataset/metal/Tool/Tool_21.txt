[Verse 1]
Free fall through our midnight
This epilogue of our own fable
Heedless in our slumber
Floating
nescient
, we
[Verse 2]
Free fall through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making
Falling isn't flying
Floating isn't infinite
[Pre-Chorus]
Come, our end, suddenly
All hail our lethargy
Concede suddenly
[Interlude]
To the quickened dissolution
Pray we mitigate the ruin
Calling all to arms and order
[Verse 3]
Drifting through this boundlessness
This madness of our own making
[Pre-Chorus]
Sound our dire reveille
Rouse all from our apathy
Lest we
Cease to be
[Chorus]
Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order
[Bridge]
Sound the dread alarm
Through the primal body
Sound the reveille
To be or not to be
Rise
Stay the grand finale
Stay the reading of our swan song and epilogue
One drive to stay alive
Elementary
Muster every fiber
Mobilize
Stay alive
[Chorus]
Stir us from our
Wanton slumber
Mitigate our ruin
Call us all to arms and order
