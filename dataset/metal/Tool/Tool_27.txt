[Verse 1]
I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole
Defeated
I concede and move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me
[Verse 2]
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt
Don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism, I
Must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out
[Refrain]
Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away
[Verse 3]
So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable
So let the light touch you so that the words spill through
And let the past break through, bringing out our hope and reason
[Refrain]
Before we pine away (Pine away)
Before we pine away (Pine away)
Before we pine away (Pine away)
Before we pine away
