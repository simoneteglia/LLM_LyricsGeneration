[Intro]
You
You believed
You believed in movements none could see
You believed in me
[Verse 1]
A passionate spirit
Uncompromised
Boundless and open
A light in your eyes
Then immobilized
[Refrain]
Broken
, broken
Fell at the hands of those movements that I wouldn't see
Yet it was you who prayed for me
So what have I done
To be a son to an angel?
What have I done
To be worthy?
[Interlude]
[Outro]
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?
"She never told a lie, well, might have told a lie
But never lived one
Didn't have a life, didn't have a life
But surely saved one"
See? I'm alright
Now
it's time for us to let you go
