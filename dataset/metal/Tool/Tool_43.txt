[Verse]
I, I don't have a whole lot of time
Um, okay, I'm a former employee of Area 51
I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and...
I've kind of been running across the country
Damn, I don't know where to start, they are
They are gonna, um, they'll triangulate on this position really really soon
Okay, um, um, okay
What we're thinking of as, as aliens
They are extra-dimensional beings
That, an earlier precursor of the, um, space program they made contact with
They, they are not what they claim to be
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment
Particularly the Area 51
Uh, the disasters that are coming, they, the military
I'm sorry, the government knows about them
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving the population to now
They are not, they want those major population centers wiped out
So that the few that are left will be more easily controllable
