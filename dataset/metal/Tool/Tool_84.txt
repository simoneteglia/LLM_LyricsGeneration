[Intro]
Startin' to piss me the fuck off
[Verse]
Yuh, that boy got me fucked up
He talk hella reckless, lil' nigga, tough luck
I'll show you some tough love
We fuckin on yo' slut deep in the tour bus
I'Il bet he won't talk tough
I put down my Tre and I'm lettin' that four bust
He wanna get sauced up
And thought he could get away pussy for sure fucked, huh
When are you niggas gon' notice
I am the one who was chosen
Lil' ho just fucked up my focus
All of you bitches is bogus
Throwin' my dick in the open
Fuck that it stay in my pants, ayy
You niggas wan' play wit' plans, ah
Just watch it how spray out my hands, yuh

Bet he break like a branch when I make my commands
I can't make that boy dance, but the Draco it can
If I take off my cape no one safe you all damned
Yuh, I am like Slayer, I stand

Yuh, a nigga want fade, I got hands
And lightsaber in hand, daddy Vader I can

Uh, no switch I pull up wit' that stick
Uh, lil' nigga talk tough, but he bitch

Ayy, now tell 'em watch out in the pit
