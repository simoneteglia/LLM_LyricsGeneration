[Verse 1]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication
[Bridge]
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication
[Verse 2]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication
[Bridge]
The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance
[Verse 3]
There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second-guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication
[Bridge]
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers
[Outro]
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
And I know the pieces fit
