[Verse 1]
Angels on the sideline
Puzzled and amused
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused
[Chorus 1]
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
Where there's one you're bound to divide it
Right in two
[Verse 2]
Angels on the sideline
Baffled and confused
Father blessed them all with reason
And this is what they choose?
(This is what they choose)
[Chorus 2]
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys
,
give them thumbs, they forge a blade
And where there's one they're bound to divide it
Right in two
Right in two
[Chorus 3]
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they make a club and beat their brother down
How they've survived so misguided is a mystery
Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here
[Bridge 1]
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
[Interlude]
[Bridge 2]
Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky and
Fight over life, over blood, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another
Fight for the time, for the one, for the rise and
[Verse 3]
Angels on the sideline again
Benched along with patience and reason
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering where this tug of war will end
[Outro]
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Right in two
Right in two
