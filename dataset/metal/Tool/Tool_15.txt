[Verse 1]
What's coming through is alive
What's holding up is a mirror
But what's singing songs is a snake, it is
Lookin' to turn my piss to wine
They're both totally void of hate, and
Killin' me just the same
[Refrain]
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again
And I feel this coming over like a storm again
Considerately
[Verse 2]
Venomous voice, tempts me
And drains me, bleeds me
Leaves me cracked and empty
Drags me down like some sweet gravity
[Refrain]
The snake behind me hisses
What my damage could have been
My blood before me begs me
Open up my heart again
And I feel this coming over like a storm again, now
And I feel this coming over like a storm again, now
[Chorus]
I am too connected to you
To slip away, to fade away
Days away, I still feel you
Touching me, changing me
[Post-Chorus]
And considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
Considerately killing me
[Verse 3]
Without the skin, here
Beneath the storm
Under these tears, now
The walls came down
Once the snake is drowned
And as I look in his eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I could have cried then
I should have cried then
As the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
And will die
It's alright
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
[Chorus]
I am too connected to you
To slip away and fade away
Days away, I still feel you
Touching me, changing me
[Post-Chorus]
And considerately killing me
Considerately killing me, yeah
Considerately killing me
