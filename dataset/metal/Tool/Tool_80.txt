[Intro]
*static noise*
Play right side
Sn- sn- sn- sn-sn-sn-sn-sna
p
that song
Snap that song, and we're back
Who's house? You know how I like those ladies when I got some feed in the hen house. All the gangsters and hoes say 'hey'!
Alright, now we got a promotion tonight, up at G-Strings. K, ALME, don't forget about...
Come in, Grizzy, 5-2, last time the girls where like, "what?", and I was all slapping that ass, son!
*static noise*
Transmitting...
Signal's coming through?
Okay
[Verse 1: Brer Rabbit]
Echo echo one-nine
Hear the call through fault lines
Smoke signals, old rhymes
Shorted lights in store signs
Spelled in broken code
, find that it is time to
Breathe, build, bend, and refine you
We sky tenants, give it all but won't give up
Radio soul antennas, radio to lift spirits
Call sign commando
M.O. is independence
Scream till the walls fall
Dissolve all the limits
[Verse 2: Jonny 5]
Occupied minds, unemployed skills
Desolation, worn out, torn down just for now
Thrill seekers, slanging
Test tube babies in beakers
Where gun blasts pump straight from the speakers
The system where the poor get poorly paid to hold the ladder
Where the rich get ricocheted into the stratosphere
And in between people are rushin' like Vladimir
With metals to make their status clear
Get us out of here
[Chorus]
We need heroes, build them
Don't put your fists up, fill them
Fight with our hopes and our hearts and our hands
We're the architects of our last stand
We need heroes, build them
Don't put your fists up, fill them
Fight with our hopes and our hearts and our hands
We're the architects of our last stand
[Interlude]
There's a war going on for your mind
Those who seek to occupy it will stop at nothing
The battlefield is everywhere
There is no sanctuary, there are no civilians
You have two choices: surrender or enlist
[Verse 3: Jonny 5]
What kind of person are you? Always the first to argue
Or never down to stick your neck out cause it hurts you far too much
To see your rep suffer, set you up a buffer
Well neither is enough for us, cut from a tougher brand of
Duct tape; the propaganda's stuffing us like sock pyjamas
Spread like a virus through accepted thoughts and proper manners
But off the cameras, something's simmering across the land
About to bubble up and knock the lids off of the pots and pans
[Verse 4: Brer Rabbit]
We are non-stop juggernauts, stomp ziggurats
Spit manifestos by terabytes and gigawatts
Shock paradigms, give sense to a score
Throw thoughts through the sky and activate twenty more
In these high and dry times, expectorate on dogma
Pragmatic sycophants divide and conquer
We build bridges, offer hard work, and prosper
As hand-made heroes brought to you by no sponsors
[Chorus]
We need heroes, build them
Don't put your fists up, fill them
Fight with our hopes and our hearts and our hands
We're the architects of our last stand
We need heroes, build them
Don't put your fists up, fill them
Fight with our hopes and our hearts and our hands
We're the architects of our last stand
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
We need heroes, build them
Don't put your fists up, fill them
Fight with our hopes and our hearts and our hands
We're the architects of our last stand
We need heroes, build them
Don't put your fists up, fill them
Fight with our hopes and our hearts and our hands
We're the architects of our last stand
[Outro: Jonny 5]
All free minds to the front
All free minds to the front
We call upon women, we call upon children
We call upon the handicapped, the infirm
The weak of heart
We need your courage, your dedication
Your passion, your conviction
Gather up your platinum, melt it down
Gather up your gold, melt it down
Gather up your silver, your bronze, your aluminum
Melt it down
Melt it down
Melt it down!
