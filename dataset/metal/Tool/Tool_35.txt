[Verse 1]
Disembodied voices deepen my
Suspicious tendencies
Conversations we've never had
Imagined interplay
[Chorus]
Psychopathy
Don't you dare point that at me
[Verse 2]
Heated altercations we've never had
So I'm told, yet guided by them all
Every single one
[Chorus]
Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over
[Verse 3]
Judge, condemn, and banish any and everyone
Without evidence
Only the whispers from within
[Chorus]
Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over
Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over
[Interlude]
Imaginal interplay
Imaginal interplay
Imaginal interplay
[Refrain]
Don't you dare point that at me
Don't you dare point that at me
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Refrain]
Don't you dare point that at me
Don't you dare point that at
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Refrain]
Don't you dare point that at me
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you dare point that at
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you dare point that at
