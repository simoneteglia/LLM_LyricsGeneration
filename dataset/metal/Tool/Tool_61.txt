[Intro: Sematary &
God's Wisdom
]
Oh
Sematary (
Oh
)
Ahh, I keep some big knives in my toolbox
Haugh
Oh
[Chorus: Sematary]
I keep some big knives in my toolbox (In my toolbox)
In the forest, you will meet my chainsaw (Meet my chainsaw)
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (Haugh)
[Verse 1: Sematary]
I got Babadook hands like a Skellington
I’m a Nazgûl dressed in True Religion
I got bloodstains on my
Affliction
I see shadows, I been off benadryl
Yeah, hot girl, she likes BDSM
You know me, I like DSBM
Ghost Mountain, Sematary, God's Wisdom
We’ll bring you down 'cross the Rainbow Bridge
[Chorus: Sematary &
Ghost Mountain
]
I keep some big knives in my toolbox (In my toolbox)
In the forest, you will meet my chainsaw (Meet my chainsaw)
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (Ha)
I keep some big knives in my toolbox (In my toolbox)
Angel, I'ma cut your face off
When they see me, they like "Oh god" (
Oh god
)
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (
Ha-ah
)
[Verse 2: Ghost Mountain &
Sematary
]
Ghost Mountain, Sematary
God's Wisdom
I'ma slice your throat out in your family kitchen
Sledgehammer, buzzsaw, blades glisten
I swear to god this gon' be your crucifixion (Crucifixion)
Follow the night, passin' by out of the window
Bury the light, witches fly, I'm a scarecrow
Curtains arise, glowin' eyes out of the shadow (
Ah
)
Catch you with my toolbox full of rusty metal
[Chorus: Sematary &
God's Wisdom
]
I keep some big knives in my toolbox
In the forest, you will meet my chainsaw
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (Ha)
I keep some big knives in my toolbox (In my toolbox)
Angel, I'ma cut your face off
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (
Oh
)
[Verse 3:
God's Wisdom
]
G-O-D-S-W-I-S-D-O-M (M-M)
MTV, I'm up next, bitch
I'm a dog, so you know I need a vet, bitch
Off the leash and you know I'm feelin' reckless
I don't want neck, but I really want some sex, bitch
Ah, 'cause I love it when you cum
I'm your Papi, hit me up
With your lips, with your tongue, yeah
Punch me in the face, baby, baby, beat me up
That's dumb, that's dumb
God's Wisdom is a
masochist
Don't like attachment
Condoms in my toolbox, uh
Down to hit it raw for a bad bitch
Got a cam for an actress
Got the wham for a bad bitch
I don't mean no disrespect
Bitch, I like to flex, bitch
[Chorus: Sematary]
I keep some big knives in my toolbox (In my toolbox)
In the forest, you will meet my chainsaw (Meet my chainsaw)
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (Ha)
I keep some big knives in my toolbox (In my toolbox)
Angel, I'ma cut your face off
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (Ha)
[Outro: Sematary &
God's Wisdom
]
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha" (
Oh
)
When they see me, they like "Oh god"
And when they run, I'm like "Ha, ha"
Oh
