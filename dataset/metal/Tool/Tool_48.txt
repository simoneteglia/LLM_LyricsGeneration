[Verse 1]
Crawled away from me
Slipped away from me
Tried to keep a hold
But there was nothing I could say
Slid away from me
Crept away from me
Tried to keep you down
But there was nothing I could say
[Chorus]
What you're trying to say
Is you don't wanna play
What you want and what you need
Don't mean that much to me
I can see your
Back is turning
If I could I'd
Stick a knife in
[Verse 2]
Crawled away from me
Slipped away from me
Tried to keep a hold
But there was nothing I could say
Slid away from me
Crept away from me
Tried to keep you down
But there was nothing I could say
[Chorus]
What you're trying to say
Is you don't wanna play
What you want and what you need
Don't mean that much to me
I can see your
Back is turning
If I could I'd
Stick a knife in
[Bridge]
This is love
This is love
This is my love for you
This is my love for you
This is my love for you
This is my love for you (My love for you)
This is my love for you
This is my love
Say you won't go
Get up stronger
Say it, say it
Get up
Say it
Get you in a stranglehold, baby
Get up, get up, get up, oh
[Chorus]
What you're trying to say
Is you don't wanna play
But what you want and what you need
Don't mean a fuck to me
I can see your
Back is turning
If I could Iâ€™d
Stick a knife in
