[Intro: Serj Tankian]
I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I know weather's gonna be fine
But I can't see you 'cross the streamline
My love waits for me in daytime
But I can't see you through the snowblind
[Chorus: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
But I wasn't there for you,
you are gone
And I wasn't there for you,
goodbyes are long
Goodbye
And I wasn't there for you,
goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
Well, I know time reveals in hindsight
I can wrestle with the stormy night
Because your love lasts a lifetime
But I can see you through the snowblind
[Chorus: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
But I wasn't there for you,
you are gone
And I wasn't there for you,
goodbyes are long
You are gone
And I wasn't there for you,
goodbyes are long
And I wasn't there for you,
goodbye!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there
I wasn't there for you
[Chorus: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
I wasn't there for you,
you are gone
And I wasn't there for you,
goodbyes are long
Goodbye!
