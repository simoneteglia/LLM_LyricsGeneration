[Verse 1: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
The big gun tells you what your life is worth
What do we deserve before we end the Earth?
If they will try to push you far away
Would you stay and take a stand?
Would you stay with gun in hand?
[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
They protect the land
They protect the land
Those who protect the land
Those who protect the land
Those who protect
[Verse 2: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
The enemy of man is his own decay
If they're evil now, then evil they will stay
If they will try to push you far away
Would you stay and take a stand?
Would you stay with gun in hand?
[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
They protect the land
They protect the land
They protect the land
Our history and victory and legacy we send
From scavengers and invaders, those who protect the land
Those who protect the land
Those who protect
Those who protect the land
Those who protect
[Bridge:
Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian]
Some were forced to foreign lands
Some would lay dead on the sand
Would you stay and take command?
Would you stay with gun in hand?
With gun in hand
[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
They protect the land
They protect the land
They protect the land
Our history and victory and legacy we send
From scavengers and invaders, those who protect the land
Our history and victory and legacy we send
From scavengers and invaders, those who protect
Those who protect the land
Those who protect the land
Those who protect
Those who protect the land
Those who protect
