[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Whoa
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
My cock is much bigger than yours
My cock can walk right through the door
With a feeling so pure
It's got you screaming back for
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
My shit stinks much better than yours
My shit stinks right down to the floor
With a feeling so pure
It's got you coming back for
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
Can't you see that I love my cock?
Can't you see that you love my cock?
Can't you see that we love my cock?
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We're the regulators that deregulate
We're the animators that de-animate
We're the propagators of all genocide
Burning through the world's resources, then we turn and hide
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We're cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We're the regulators that deregulate
We're the animators that de-animate
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We're cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
[Outro: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
My cock is much bigger than yours
My cock can walk right through the door
With a feeling so pure
It's got you screaming back for more
