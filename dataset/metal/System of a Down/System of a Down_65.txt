[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
And the little boy stared to the eyes of the night
Button collects price of his time
Little girl glared, sheets of denial
Bullet connects to the price of her crime
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
What have we said, wasn't in their bed
What of presence haven't we paid penance
For the nüguns
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Now, the little boy sees through the eyes of delight
Levers erect note of his rhyme
Little girl bled, sheets of the night
Lovers connect to the price of his dime
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
What have we said, wasn't in their bed
What of presence haven't we paid penance
For the nüguns, for the nüguns
[Oud Solo]
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
What have we said, wasn't in their bed
What of presence haven't we paid penance
What have we said, wasn't in their bed
What of presence haven't we paid penance
For the nüguns, for the nüguns (To you)
