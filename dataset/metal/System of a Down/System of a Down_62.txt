[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Fish that don't drown, life in a bubble jungle
I wouldn't frown, not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground, but I was in there for you
Now, leaving town, life in a bubble jungle
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Wearing the crown, life in a bubble jungle
Chasing a clown, not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground, but I was waiting for you
Now, we have found, life in a bubble jungle
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Left with no arms in the power struggle
Left with no arms in the power struggle
[Bridge: Serj Tankian &
Arto Tunçboyacıyan

May I remind you, may I remind you, may I remind you
May I remind you, may I remind you, may I remind you
(
Bad men would have told us the lie
)
May I remind you, may I remind you, may I remind you
May I remind you, may I remind you, may I remind you
Your life is in a bubble jungle
(
Bad men would have told us the lie
)
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Seeing you believing, us adhering, we're the power struck
Believing, then kneeling, appeasing, the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
We're left with no arms right in the power struggle
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Left with no arms in the power struggle
Left with no arms right here in the power struggle
