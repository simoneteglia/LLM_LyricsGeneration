[Verse 1]
â€”grace
Living in my room, and looking out through my door
Is there a reason to be or else think like me?
And hear the people around were not known to be bound
Being embraced out of President's grace, then they come and batter you
[Pre-Chorus]
All around me, people, well are they killed?
Hold me 'round the throat, well are they killed?
All around me, people, are they killed?
Killed? Killed? Killed? Killed?
[Chorus]
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake!
[Verse 2]
The ghost with a heart of darkness
Pierces the hardened soul
Kneel to the killing by me
Bow down to the governor of all
Listening to freedom, do another disgrace
When they hear that the president beats me
Listening to freedom, do another disgrace
When I hear that the [?] beats me
[Pre-Chorus]
All around me, people, well are they killed?
Hold me 'round the throat, well are they killed?
All around me, people, are they killed?
Killed? Killed? Killed? Killed?
[Chorus]
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake!
[Bridge]
I hear my betrayal and I now feel I can't see you in here
I fear my friend and I now feel I can't see you inside here
[Outro]
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You flake! You flake! You're gonna fuckin' flake!
You'll die! You're die! You'll die! You're die!
You'll die! You're die! You'll die! You flake!
