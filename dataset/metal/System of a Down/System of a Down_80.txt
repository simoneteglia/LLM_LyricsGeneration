[Chorus]
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
[Verse 1]
I don't see nothing but pain and misery
Because you are the one for me
Why can't it all be true?
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie
Why can't it all be true, why can't it all be true?
[Chorus]
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
[Verse 2]
Suddenly I believe, you were the one for me
Graciously, you go through my closed heart's artery
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie
Why can't it all be true, why can't it all be true?
[Bridge]
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
[Verse 3]
I don't see nothing but pain and misery
Because you are the one for me
Why can't it all be true?
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie
Why can't it all be true, why can't it all be true?
[Chorus]
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
I'm wishing and wishing away at you, God
Wishing and wishing away at you, God
Wishing and wishing away at you, God
Wishing and wishing away at you, God
Wishing and wishing away at you, God
At you, God, at you, God
At you, God, at you, God
