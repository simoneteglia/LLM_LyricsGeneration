[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Kemper, Kemper solved it all
He fooled the shrinks, fooled the shrinks
Then it appears the proclamation
Had fooled the shrinks, fooled the shrinks
Kemper, Kemper solved it all
He fooled the shrinks, fooled the shrinks
It then appears the proclamation
Had fooled the shrinks, fooled the shrinks
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The fortress of forever been forsaken
Man-made pond is polluted with blue dye
Air, water, trees, life
Man-made pond is polluted with blue dye
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Can we tamper, we have gained
Outer space, outer space
A million years, the devastation of
Outer space, outer space
Can we tamper, we have gained
Outer space, outer space
That's not true, that's not true!
The human race, the human race
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The fortress of forever been forsaken
Man-made pond is polluted with blue dye
Air, water, trees, life
Man-made pond is polluted with blue dye
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Fortress of forever been mistaken
Man-made pond is polluting of the skies
Fortress of forever been mistaken
Man-made pond is polluting of the skies
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The fortress of forever been forsaken
Man-made pond is polluted with blue dye
Air, water, trees, life
Man-made pond is polluted with blue dye
