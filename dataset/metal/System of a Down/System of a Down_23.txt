[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Sweet berries ready for two,
ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you,
are you?
Sweet berries ready for two,
ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you,
are you dreaming?
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Dreaming the night
Dreaming alright
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Sweet berries ready for two,
ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you,
are you?
Sweet berries ready for two,
ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you,
are you dreaming?
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Dreaming the night
Dreaming alright
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?
Yeah (It'll be alright)
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?
Yeah
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
