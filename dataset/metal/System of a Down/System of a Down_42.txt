[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Dark is the light, the man you fight with all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold this bounty soul, a gentile or a priest?
Who victored over the Seljuks when the holy land was taken?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Was it the riches of the land, powers of bright darkness
That lead the nobles to the East to fight the heathens
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
[Post-Chorus]
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it
No International security, no call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill a man, history teaches us so
The reason he must attain must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war
[Pre-Chorus]
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
[Chorus]
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
[Outro]
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
Now, we will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
