[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
The unsettled mind as it climbs in the light
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
The senses collect from the valuable data
Of beta carotene and Thetawaves
The unsettled mind as it climbs in the light
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves, then
The senses wander the sky
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Is there life in waiting for you
Is there life in waiting for you
Waiting for you
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
The national debt as it climbs in the light
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
The people collect of the undeniable data
Of eyeballs weapons and microwaves
The national debt as it climbs in the light
Leaving the people to fend for themselves, then
The people found out the lie
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Is there life in waiting for you
Is there life in waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you...
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Waiting to get you high
Waiting to touch the sky
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Is there life in waiting for you
Is there life in waiting for you
Is there life in waiting for you
Is there life in waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you...
