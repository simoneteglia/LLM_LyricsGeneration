[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian,
with Daron Malakian
]
Hey you, see me, pictures, crazy
All the world I've seen before me passing by
I've got nothing; to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me passing by
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel it anymore
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Anymore, na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian,
with Daron Malakian
]
Hey, you are me, not so pretty
All the world I've seen before me passing by
Silent, my voice, I've got no choice
All the world I've seen before me passing by
[Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel it
anymore
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
I don't see (
Anymore
)
I don't hear (
Anymore
)
I don't speak (
Anymore
)
I don't feel...
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Hey you, see me, pictures, crazy
All the world I've seen before me passing by
I've got nothing; to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me passing by
[Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel it
anymore
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
I don't sleep (
Anymore
)
I don't eat (
Anymore
)
I don't live (
Anymore
)
I don't feel (
Anymore
)
