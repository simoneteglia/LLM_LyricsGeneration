[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I cannot disguise
All the stomach pains and the walking of the canes
When you do come out
And you whisper up to me in your life of tragedy
But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me, oh, when will I be free?
And you, a parasite
Just find another host, just another fool to roast
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
'Cause you, my tapeworm tells me what to do
You, my tapeworm tells me where to go
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
I cannot deny
All the evil traits and the filling of the crates
When you,
you
, do come out,
out
And you slither up to me in your pimpin' majesty
But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me, oh, when will I be free?
And you,
you
, a parasite,
site
Just find another host just another stool to post
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
'Cause you, my tapeworm tells me what to do
You, my tapeworm tells me where to go
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of me, out of me
[Bridge: Daron Malakian
with Serj Tankian
]
I'm sitting in my room with a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man
Sitting in my room with a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb of some old dying man!
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
You, my tapeworm tells me what to do
You, my tapeworm tells me where to go
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Fuck me
