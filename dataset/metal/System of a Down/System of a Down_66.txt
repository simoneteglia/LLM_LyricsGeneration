[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Flaunt your will at every wheel
Perish it, your chocolate soul
Cobblestones under your wheels
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Circumvent your thick ego
When in fights, they're on the go
You can't tell me that I'm real
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
[Bridge: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
Fear waits,
fear waits
For us,
for us
When the present can't be sealed
Away,
away
Gold dust,
gold dust
Now the dishes can be cleared
Fear waits,
fear waits
For us,
for us
Until the moment is revealed,
revealed
Then turns,
then turns
To rust,
to rust
For the mighty conquered meal
[Verse 3: Serj Tankian]
Can't you look at my shaved ass
Ounce is gone, and God is once
You can't see me suddenly
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
I got pictures on my mind
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
I got pictures on my mind
