[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Can you feel their haunting presence?
Can you feel their haunting presence?
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Liar, killer, demon! Back to the river Aras
Someone's blank stare deemed it warfare
Liar, killer, demon! Back to the river Aras
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Freedom, freedom
We're free, we're free
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Can you hear the holy mountains?
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Liar, killer, demon! Back to the river Aras
Someone's mouth said, "Paint them all red"
Liar, killer, demon! Back to the river Aras
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Freedom, freedom
We're free, we're free
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
They have all returned, resting on the mountainside
We have learned that you have no
They have returned, resting on the mountainside
We have learned that you have no
[Pre-Chorus]
Honor, murderer, sodomizer!
Back to the river Aras
They have returned, resting on the mountainside
We have learned that you have no
Honor, murderer, sodomizer!
Back to the river Aras
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Freedom, freedom
We're free, free
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
