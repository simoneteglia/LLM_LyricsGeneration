[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Superstition taking all of us for a ride
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight
While you are talking all detached, so tell us
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where you going? To the bottom?
Do you hear us? We are rotting
[Chorus: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
We're going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
Ceremonies have killed religions,
for they provide
The masked comforts to delusionals,
they're all in fright
The true believer's head was bathed and in
sunlight
While you are walking all detached, so tell us
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where you going? To the bottom?
Do you hear us? We are rotting
[Chorus: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
We're going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now
Not even God, no one saved us
No one's gonna save us
[Bridge: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall? Ah, ah
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall?
Ah
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
[Verse 3: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
Superstition taking all of us
for a ride
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right
The bombs are falling overhead
with no sight
While you are talking all detached
Detached, detached, detached, detached
[Chorus: Serj Tankian,
Daron Malakian
,
Both
]
Going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now
Not even God, n
o one saved us,
no one saved us
No one saved us, no one's gonna save us now
[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
