[Verse 1: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Dead man lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when savior comes, is he gonna be saved?
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved?
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
They were crying when their sons left, God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope, he's never coming back
They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Welcome to the soldier side, where there's no one here but me
People all grow up to die, there is no one here but me
Welcome to the soldier side, there is no one here but me
People on the soldier side, there is no one here but me
