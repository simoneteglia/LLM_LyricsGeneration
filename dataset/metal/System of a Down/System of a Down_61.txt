[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic, flag-waving, ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Come join the cause, come join the cause
Who wants to come with me and come join the cause?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic, flag-waving, ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic, flag-waving, ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Realize you're blind and we're out of time
It'll show your mind
Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em beat 'em
All pathetic, flag-waving, ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
You and me should go outside
And beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em beat 'em
All pathetic, flag-waving, ignorant geeks
And we'll eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
[Outro: Daron Malakian with Serj Tankian]
It'll show your mind
That you have a mind
