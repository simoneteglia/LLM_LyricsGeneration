[Verse 1:
Serj Tankian
]
I had an out of body experience
The other day, her name was Jesus
And for her, everyone cried
Everyone cried, everyone cried
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Try her philosophy, try her philosophy
Try her philosophy, try
You die for her philosophy, die for her philosophy
Die her philosophy, die
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Crossed and terrored ravages of architecture
Lend me thy blades
We're crossed and terrored ravages of architecture
Hoist around the spade
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Try her philosophy, try her philosophy
Try her philosophy, try
You die for her philosophy, die for her philosophy
Die her philosophy, die
[Bridge: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
Die! Die! Die! Why!?
Lie naked on the floor and
Let the Messiah go through our souls
Lie naked on the floor and
Let the Messiah go all through our souls
Die! (
Like a motherfucker
)
Die! (
Like a motherfucker
)
Die! (
Like a motherfucker
)
Why!? (
Like a motherfucker
)
I wanna fuck my way to the garden
'Cause everyone needs a mother... fucker
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
