[Verse 1: Daron Malakian]
Damn you
Stay away from me
I got a disease
Everyone is sleeping
[Verse 2: Daron Malakian]
Hate you
For putting hate in me
For putting faith in me
Everyone is sleeping
[Outro: Daron Malakian]
Everyone is sleeping
Everyone is sleeping
Everyone is sleeping
Everyone is sleeping!
