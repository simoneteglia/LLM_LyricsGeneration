[Verse 1]
Education, fornication, in you are; go
Education, subjugation, now you're out; go
Education, fornication, in you are; go
Don't be late for school again, boy
[Chorus]
I think me, I want a life
I think me, I want a house and a wife
I want to shimmy-shimmy-shimmy
Through the break of dawn, yeah
[Verse 2]
Education, fornication, in you are; go
Education, subjugation, now you're out; go
Education, fornication, in you are; go
Don't be late for school again, girl
[Chorus]
I think me, I want a life
I think me, I want a house and a wife
I want to shimmy-shimmy-shimmy
Through the break of dawn, yeah
I think me, I want a life
I think me, I want a house and a wife
I want to shimmy-shimmy-shimmy
Through the break of dawn, yeah

Indoctrination of a nation
Indoctrination of a nation
Subjugation of damnation
Subjugation of damna-

Don't be late for school again, boy
Don't be late for school again, girl
Don't be late for school again, boy
Don't be late for school again, girl
