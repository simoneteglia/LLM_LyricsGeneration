[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Tell the people, tell the people that arrive
Tell the people, tell the people that arrive
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
Die
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Show your people, show your people how we died
Show your people, show your people how we died
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
No need to nullify
No need to nullify
No need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
Die
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
We don't need to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We don't need to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We don't need to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We don't need to
[Verse 3: Serj Tankian]
Ask your people, ask your people what is right
Ask your people, ask your people what is right
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
No need to multiply
No need to multiply
No need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
