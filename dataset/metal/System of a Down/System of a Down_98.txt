[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I need not fear the love, you love to love the fear
I never want to be alone, I've forgotten too
The road keeps moving the clouds, the clouds become unreal
I guess I'll always be at home
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Do you want me to try?
Directing your night
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
An exit lights the sky, the sky becomes complete
Traveling hearts divine the throne, I've forgotten too
Friction, lines, bumps, the highway song complete
The signs are all turning right
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Do you want me to try?
Directing your night
Want me to try
Directing your life
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time
Our days are never coming back
The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time
Our days are never ever coming back
[Guitar Solo]
