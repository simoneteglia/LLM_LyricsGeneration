[Intro: Daron Malakian]
You!
Why do they always send the poor?
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
Victorious Victorias kneel for brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection,
yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
blowing up the sunshine
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion,
still, you feed us lies from the table cloth
[Chorus: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
blowing up the sunshine
[Bridge: Daron Malakian]
Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?
[Refrain: Daron Malakian
with Serj Tankian
]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why they always send the poor?
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion,
still, you feed us lies from the table cloth
[Chorus: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
blowing up the sun
[Refrain: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
They always send the poor, they always send the poor
