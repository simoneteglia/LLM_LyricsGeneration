[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Let me desecrate your child
Let me penetrate your world
Let me penetrate your mind
Let me desecrate you
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Little boy stared into the eyes of the night
Button collects price of his time
Little girl bled, sheets of the night
Bullet connects to the price of its crime
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love
I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love
