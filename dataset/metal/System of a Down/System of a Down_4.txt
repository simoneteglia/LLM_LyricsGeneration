[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all
'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play, but you never wanna lose, oh
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize
[Outro: Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, om
