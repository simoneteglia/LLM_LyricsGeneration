[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
The phoenix he helped create
Out of control, boy without a dad
Shot the gun that startled my life
While I drove him with a
forty-five
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Friends for years images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, death, insecurity
The men fall unrealized
[Post-Chorus]
Unrealized, unrealized
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Making a decision of death while everyone around you plead
Now, you fly in peace I hope, my friend
A man can't avoid what he's meant to do when he's meant to do it
Even if he doesn't really want to
My memories are of fun and friendship
Of weakness within the strength of youth
For reasons undefined, reasons undefined
Reasons undefined, reasons undefined
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Friends for years images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, death, insecurity
The men fall unrealized
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Don't you realize evil lives in the motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil lives in the motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil lives in the motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil lives in the skin
Unrealized
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Don't you realize evil lives in the motherfucking skin
Don't you realize that evil lives in the motherfucking skin
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Why the fuck did you take him away from us you motherfucker?
Fucker, fucker
