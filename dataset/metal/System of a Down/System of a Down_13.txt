[Verse 1]
Circumventing circuses, lamenting in protest
To visible police, presence-sponsored fear
Battalions of riot police with rubber bullet kisses
Baton courtesy,
service with a smile
[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence
[Chorus]
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
[Verse 2]
A rush of words, pleading to disperse
Upon your naked walls, alive
A political call, the fall guy accord
We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train
[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence
[Chorus]
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
[Bridge]
Push them around
A deer dance, invitation to peace
War staring you in the face
Dressed in black
With a helmet, fierce
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents
For the disproportioned malcontents
A little boy smiled, it'll all be well
And say a little boy smiled, it'll all be well
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
[Chorus]
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children with their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
[Outro]
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
They like to push the weak around
