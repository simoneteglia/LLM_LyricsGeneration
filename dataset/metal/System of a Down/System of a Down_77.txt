[Verse 1]
What’s my problem, here’s my problem
My problem is that I’m too visual to be blind
Too audiological to be deaf, too ideological to be in peace
Too compassionate to be in war, too crazy to be sane
Too sane to be lazy, too emotional to be you
[Pre-Chorus]
If I could only stop my head
From going into constant infection
Then maybe I could swim back
To my own version of consistent sanity
Angelic demons, liquid dreams
Transparent mountains of our own reality
[Chorus]
Burning oceans, melting faces
Melting faces, why?
[Pre-Chorus]
If I could only stop my head
From going into constant infection
Then maybe I could swim back
To my own version of consistent sanity
Angelic demons, liquid dreams
Transparent mountains of our own reality
[Chorus]
Burning oceans, melting faces
Melting faces, why?
Lying Glaciers, swimming Meadows
Mind control
[Bridge]
Amnesia! Hysteria! Insomnia!
Can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t shit
Cause you’re in the hospital and they’re fucking
Why!?
[Chorus]
Burning oceans, melting faces
Melting faces, why?
Flying Glaciers! Swimming Meadows!
Mind control
[Outro]
Maybe my mind’s not at all in control
Maybe I’m not in control
