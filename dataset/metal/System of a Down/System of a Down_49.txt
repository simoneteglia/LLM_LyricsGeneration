[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Elimination
Elimination
Elimination
Die!
Why?
Walk down! (Walk down!)
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
A whole race, genocide
Taken away, all of our pride
A whole race, genocide
Taken away,
watch them all fall down!
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Revolution, the only solution
The armed response of an entire nation
Revolution, the only solution
We've taken all their shit, now it's time for restitution
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
Recognition, restoration, reparation
Recognition, restoration, reparation,
watch them all fall down!
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Revolution, the only solution
The armed response of an entire nation
Revolution, the only solution
We've taken all their shit, now it's time for restitution
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
The plan was mastered and called genocide
(
Never want to see you 'round
)
You took all the children and they died
(
Never want to see you 'round
)
The few that remained were never found
(
Never want to see you 'round
)
All in a system
[Breakdown: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
Down! Down! Down!
Walk down! Walk down! Walk down!
Watch them all fall down!
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Revolution, the only solution
The armed response of an entire nation
Revolution, the only solution
We've taken all their shit, now it's time for restitution!
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
The plan was mastered and called genocide
(
Never want to see you 'round
)
You took all the children and they died
(
Never want to see you 'round
)
The few that remained were never found
(
Never want to see you 'round
)
All in a system, down
