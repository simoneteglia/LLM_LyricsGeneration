[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
We fought your wars with all our hearts
You sent us back in body parts
You took our wills with the truth you stole
We offer prayers for your long lost soul
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The remainder is an unjustifiable
Egotistical power struggle
At the expense of the American dream
Of the American dream, of the American
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a damn about your world
Right now, right now
We don't give a fuck about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a fuck about your world
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
There is no flag that is large enough
To hide the shame of a man in cuffs
You switched the signs then you closed their blinds
You changed the channels and you changed their minds
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The remainder is an unjustifiable
Egotistical power struggle
At the expense of the American dream
Of the American dream, of the American
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a damn about your world
Right now, right now
We don't give a fuck about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a fuck about your world
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
No flag large enough
Shame on the men in cuffs
Close their blinds
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The remainder is an unjustifiable
Egotistical power struggle
At the expense of the American dream
Of the American dream, of the American
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a damn about your world
Right now, right now
We don't give a fuck about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls
We don't give a fuck about your world
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now-now-now-now
