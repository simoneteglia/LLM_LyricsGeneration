[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Hey, Mr. Jack
Is that the mouthwash in your eyes?
Hey, Mr. Jack
Is that the cause of your surprise?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Hey, where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car?

[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Your prospect of living gone
You ran the light at dawn
Protectors on your back

Put your hands up, get out of the car
Fuck you, pig
Fuck you, pig
Fuck you, pig
Fuck you, pig
Put your hands up, get out of the car
