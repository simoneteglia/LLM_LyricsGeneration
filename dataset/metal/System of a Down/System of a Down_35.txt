[Verse 1: Serj Tankian,
Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian
]
Conquest to the lover and your love to the fire
Permanence unfolding in the absolute
Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror
The pictures of time and space are rearranged
In this little piece of typical tragedy
Justified candy,
brandy for the nerves
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian,
Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian
]
I forgot to, I forgot to let you know that
Justified candy,
brandy for the nerves
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror
Conquest to the lover and your love to the fire
Permanence unfolding in the absolute
Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
Generation
(Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah)
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
What is in us that turns a deaf ear
To the cries of human suffering?
Suffering, now
Woah
Suffering, now
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
You and me, we'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
Generation
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
