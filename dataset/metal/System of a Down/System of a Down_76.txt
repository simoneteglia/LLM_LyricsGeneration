[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Now, we want peace with Patriot missiles
Blown to bits are civilian targets
Parade, laugh, rejoice, sing
We're the victors of nothing
Spend more money on a war
Your people starving, turned to whores
Slaves of the chosen ones
Paying millions for each bomb
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Country without a race
Formed from people you disgrace
White right conservative might
Killers of Kennedy's with no fright
The American way
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Freedom cried the marching man
Flags ripped out of their black hands
Beaten, slain, tortured, killed
Their only mistake was being born here
Invade countries just for oil
Send your troops all down to boil
Iraq, Grenada, 'Nam and Chile
Truman doctrine, our own way
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Country without a race
Formed from people you disgrace
White right conservative might
Killers of Kennedy's with no fright
The American way
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Serj Tankian]
The government here can suck my balls
Policing the world in overalls
Armed rebellion, minority
Disrespected race, color mind
Crazed loonies all walk the streets
Missing children on milk cartons
Mother selling child for crack
Mr. President, check your back
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Country without a race
Formed from people you disgrace
White right conservative might
Killers of Kennedy's with no fright
The American way
The American way
The American way
