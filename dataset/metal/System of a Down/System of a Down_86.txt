[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Time is always now here forever
Time is always now gone, never
God is now the ruler of the present
His son a lesson, born of a peasant
Here, now, forever
Happiness ends at the end of a beautiful tunnel
Now, forever
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Run, run, run away, to a land far away
Where the hills are green and the water is gray
Maria ran with passion, not seen in women
Thanks for the bigger life and it's forceful
Daddy, no longer the man, no matter
Due is her freedom for loneliness with the dollar
No longer the man, no matter
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
I've been poisoned by God
The devil is money
I will never marry, 'til I'm ready
To be a perfect man
Mommy, I love you
I hate you
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Well, honey, the babysitter's here
Honey, it's 8 o'clock
Sweet honey, the babysitter's here, honey?
Honey! The babysitter's here!
Honey! It's 8 o'clock!
Honey! It's 8 o'clock! It's 8 o'clock!
