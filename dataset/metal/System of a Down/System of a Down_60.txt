[Verse 1]
Plagiarized existence exist among the writers of the word
Shake your spear at Shakespeare, shake your spear at Shakespeare
[Chorus]
Loud and noisy, strong refrigerators
Gaining independence, gaining independence
[Verse 2]
Stupid people do stupid things, smart people outsmart each other
Then themselves, then themselves, then themselves, then themselves
[Chorus]
Take me down there, photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy, the devil is so lovely
[Post-Chorus]
The devil is so lovely
The devil is so lovely
So lovely, so lovely
[Verse 3]
My blue moon rivets in exits,
forewarned customary spirits
By myself, by myself, by myself, by myself
[Chorus]
Take me down there, photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy, the devil is so lovely
Take me down there, photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy, the devil is so lovely
