[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Oh, baby, come close to me
Let me love you
Oh, baby, come close to me
Let me feel you
Look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other
Look at each other, look at each other
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Go away, go away
Go away, go away!
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Well now mutually, mentally molested children of a Mother
Mutually, mentally molested children of Sin
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that took you under
Oh no, the ever so popular beating that broke your skin
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame! Hate!
For Fate's Seed!
Go away, go away
Go away, go away!
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Now, you need the ones you love, love the ones that you need
Need the ones you love and love the ones you bleed
Lives rearranged and lives in my range, can you see?
Lives rearranged and lives in my range, can you see?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Free thinkers are dangerous
Blame! Hate!
For Fate's Seed!
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!
Gonna let you mother fuckers die!
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other
Look at each other
