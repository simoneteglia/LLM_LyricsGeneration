[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Stretching, filing, against her skin
Blessed are those who are not kin
In sin, we breathe; in sex, we tie
Duct tape her legs to the red sky
Foolsome flesh allowances
The pansies raided the pantry of
Gabardine dreams, promiscuous
Delight, deny not the flavor
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Custard dreams
Abusing, musing
Marmalade flesh
Naked spread am I, am I
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Actors of the tragic phantom
Extend your legs for great Saturn
Brown table tops scream for cover
At the sight of your new lover
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
If today I die
And can't deny
The poison chosen
For tonight, tonight
Woo!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Serj Tankian]
Borrowed dreams, hollowed reveries
Metal pillows, pewter yellows
Furry roadkill, house on the hill
Pouring gravy on her thighs still
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
If today I die
And can't deny
The poison chosen
For tonight, tonight
