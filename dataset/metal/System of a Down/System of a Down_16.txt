[Intro: Daron Malakian]
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
[Verse 1: Daron Malakian
with Serj Tankian
]
I'll wait here, you're crazy
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You should've never gone to Hollywood
They find you, two-time you
Say you're the best they've ever seen
You should've never trusted Hollywood
[Verse 2: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
I wrote you and told you
You were the biggest fish out here
You should've never gone to Hollywood
They take you and make you
They look at you in disgusting ways
You should've never trusted Hollywood
[Chorus: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian

(
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
)
(
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
)
(
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
)
I was standing on the wall, feeling ten feet tall
(
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
)
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
(
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
)
This is my front page, this is my new age
(
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
)
All you bitches, put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
(
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
)
(
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
)
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
(
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
)
(
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
)
All you bitches, put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
[Bridge: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian

(
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
)
Phony people come to pray, ah, ah
(
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
)
Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray
(
Ah, ah, the lines in the letter said
"We have gone to Hackensack"
)
Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray
[Chorus: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian

Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard

All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard

All you maggots smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard
(
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

You should have never trusted Hollywood

Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah

You should have never gone to Hollywood
(
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

All you bitches, put your hands in the air

You should've never trusted Hollywood
