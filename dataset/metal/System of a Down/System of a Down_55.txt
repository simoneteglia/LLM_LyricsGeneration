[Intro: Daron Malakian]
Yeah
All right
Yeah, all right
[Verse 1:
Serj Tankian
with Daron Malakian
]
Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies living it all fading
Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies fading, one's abating
Two suns living it all, dying
Two suns fighting, one's abiding
Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns seeing them both dying
Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns fighting, one's abiding
Two skies seeing them b
oth dying
Two skies fading, one's abating
Ah, ah, ah
[Verse 2: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian
]
Crack pipes, needles, PCP, and fast cars
Kind of mix really well in a dead movie star
When I feel like talking, I never be wrong
If I feel like walking, you best come along
I close my windows, crank the heat up high
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Till my palms are wet and my tongue is dry
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
[Chorus: Daron Malakian
with
Serj Tankian
]
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Just a stupid motherfucker; if I die, I die
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
I'm a midnight fistfight
Looking for a mother that will
get
me high
Just a stupid motherfucker; if I die, I die
I'm a midnight fistfight
Looking
for
a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker; if I die, I die
All right
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker; if I die, I die
All right
(Two suns fighting, one's abiding)
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker; if I die, I die
(Two skies fading, one's abating)
'Cause I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker; if I die, I die
(Two suns fighting, one's abiding)
Yeah, I am looking for a mother that will get me high
I'm a stupid motherfucker; if I die, I die
All right
(Two skies, two suns, watching them all go)
[Outro: Daron Malakian]
Yeah
All right
Yeah, all right
