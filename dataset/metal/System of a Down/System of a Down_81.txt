[Intro]
Die! Die! Die! Die!
[Verse 1]
Your prospect of living gone
You ran the light at dawn
Protectors on your back
Lights are on their track
You must now face authority
You're nothing like me
You must now face authority
You're nothing like me
[Chorus]
Put your hands up, get out of the car!
Put your hands up, get out of the car!
Put your hands up, get out of the car!
Fuck you pig!
[Verse 2]
Get them reported
Let them just fucking run
The man that I broke
He still fits in his sleep
Evil is written paper on
Looks like he made what you are
Evil is written paper on
Let them fuck with your rights
[Chorus]
Put your hands up, get out of the car!
Put your hands up, get out of the car!
Put your hands up, get out of the car!
Fuck you pig!
[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
Seven A.M. morning came to take us away
Little men, big guns, pointed at our heads
Seven A.M. morning came to take us away
Little men, big guns, pointed at our heads
Ah
[Verse 4]
Prepare yourself for death, your life is under attack
You die for life, you die for life, it's all just an [?]
Prepare yourself for death, your life is under attack
You die for life, you die for life, it's all just an [?]
Prepare yourself for death, your life is under attack
You die for life, you die for life, it's all just an [?]
[Outro]
I don't know why you're talking to me
I don't know why you're talking to me
I don't know why you're talking to me
Why, why, why?
I don't know why you're talking to me
I don't know why you're talking to me
I don't know why you're talking to me
Fuck you in your face! Face! Face!
Fuck you in your face! Face! Face!
