[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Watching from a post up high
From where you see the ships afar
From a well trained eye
The waves all keep on crashing by
If you are the light post
Then you own the working class
But if you want the answers
You better give a piece of your ass!
Give a piece of your ass
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Warning, post-hypnotic suggestions
Running the ships ashore
The orange light that follows
Will soon proclaim itself a god
If you point your questions
The fog will surely chew you up
But if you want the answers
You better get ready for the fire!
Ready for the fire
[Outro:
Serj Tankian
]
The ships are multiplying day after day, sir
And they're coming close to the shore, sir; shore, sir
We need to evacuate the light post
It's all over, over
It's all over
