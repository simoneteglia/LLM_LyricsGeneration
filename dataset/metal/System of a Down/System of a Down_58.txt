[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
May I please remain in this space
For darts screech by my desires
May I please remain in this space
For darts screech by my desires
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Art thou, not human man
Art thou, not human man
Art thou, not human man
Art thou, not human man
Art thou, not human man
Art thou, not human man
Art thou, not human man
Art thou, not human man art thou
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Life-threatening lifestyles
A hitman, a nun; lovers
Life-threatening lifestyles
A hitman, a nun; lovers
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
And Ishkur
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Clock men, for they will (Fail!)
Fear not the gods that come from the (Sky!)
Long not for the one who've lost their (Way!)
Long not for the one who've lost their (Way!)
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
And Ishkur, Ishkur, motherfucker
