[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Peter's pecker picked another pickle bearing pussy pepper
Peter's pecker picked another pickle bearing pussy pepper, why?
Meeting John at Dale's Jr, winked an eye and point a finger
Meeting John at Dale's Jr, winked an eye and point a finger, why?
A former cop, undercover, just got shot, now recovered
A former cop, undercover, just got shot, now recovered, why?
Fighting crime with a partner, Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter
Fighting crime with a partner, Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter, *siren*
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
As we light up the sky
[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Peter's pecker picked another pickle bearing pussy pepper
Peter's pecker picked another pickle bearing pussy pepper, why?
Meeting John at Dale's Jr, winked an eye and point a finger
Meeting John at Dale's Jr, winked an eye and point a finger, why?
A former cop, undercover, just got shot, now recovered
A former cop, undercover, just got shot, now recovered, why?
Fighting crime with a partner, Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter
Fighting crime with a partner, Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter, *siren*
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
As we light up the sky
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
As we light up the sky
[Bridge]
Mind illusions acquainted, bubbles erotica
Plutonium wedding rings, icicle stretchings
Bicycles, shoestrings, one flag, flaggy but one
Painting the paintings of the alive
[Chorus]
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
As we light up the sky
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
On the 4th of July-y!
