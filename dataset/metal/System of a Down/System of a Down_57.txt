[Verse 1: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Life is but a dream
Drifting on a stream, a stream
Consciously it seems
All of what remains
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Ego Brain, man made shame
Shame love after it rains
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the Fall
As I turn to sand, you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I am just a man
Fighting other men for land, for land
While I turn to sand
In Spite of the pain
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Ego Brain, man made shame
Shame love after it rains
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the Fall
As I turn to sand, you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
All of what remains...
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Ego Brain, man made shame
Shame love after it rains
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the Fall
As I turn to sand, you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Love after it rains
