[Verse 1: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
She's like heroin, sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help, I need someone to save her ass
Chinese tricks in rooms with ghosts of hooker girly dudes
Me and heroin, maybe we can make some cash selling
[Chorus: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian
]
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
[Verse 2: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
She wants nothing more but to be a little
whore
He wants nothing less but to wear a little dress
She's like heroin, sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help, I need someone to make some cash selling
[Chorus: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian
]
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
Ass!
Selling ass for heroin
[Interlude: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la, la, la-la
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Bridge: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
She's like heroin, sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help, I need someone to save her ass
She wants nothing more but to be a little whore
He wants nothing less but to wear a little dress
She's like heroin, sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help, I need someone to save her ass
Chinese tricks in rooms with ghosts of hooker girly dudes
Me and heroin, maybe we can make some cash
[Outro: Daron Malakian]
She's like heroin, sipping through a little glass
I'm looking for some help, I need someone to save my ass
