[Intro: Serj Tankian]
I don't know why she called
But it was her strange way
Of tellin' me about her
Fuck!
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
She told me she was the one and then everything was done
And then I looked around, what did I see?
She told me she was the one and then everything was done
And then I looked around and, what did I see?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Well I fucked her
Right underneath the tree
And I can't believe I took her virginity
Virginity
, virginity
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
And then I just woke up, what a strange nightmare
My eyes couldn't focus, was it her?
Was it a friend or foe? I didn't really know
But as I turned around, what did I see?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Well I fucked her
Right underneath the tree
And I can't believe I took her virginity
Virginity, virginity
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Virgin tea, virgin tea
Virgin tea, virgin tea
Won't you buy some virgin tea?
Won't you buy some virgin tea?
Won't you buy some virgin tea?
Won't you buy some virgin tea?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Well I fucked her
Right underneath the tree
And I can't believe I took her virginity
Virginity, virginity
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
And then I just woke up
What a strange nightmare
My eyes couldn't focus
Was it her?
