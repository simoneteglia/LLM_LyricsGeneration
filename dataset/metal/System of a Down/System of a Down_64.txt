[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Preflight delight
Defaced street lights
A pyramid mind fuck
Don't leave your seats now
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Popcorn everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Corn everywhere canned
Cliché people cannot dare, dare, dare, dare
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
I want to be
A fallen ruby
Guest vibrations
Don't leave your seats now
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people cannot dare, dare, dare, dare
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Dare, dare
Dare, dare
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people cannot dare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliché people cannot dare, dare, dare, dare
