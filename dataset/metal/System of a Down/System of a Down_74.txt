[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
The spine align, the fetus is mine
Don't forget me, don't forget me, don't forget me, don't forget
Revolt, revolt, revolution, counter-revolution, counter-counter
Revolution, the mind
Mind the mind that feeds the blind and helps you find and makes you bind
The game is on
The game is on, the game is on, the game is on, the game is on
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine!
The spine align, the fetus is mine
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
A life, denied
Comatosis, comatosis, comatosis, comment on my
Word, define
My words define, my words define, my words define, my words define
The line, the line
Revolution, counterrevolution, counter-counter revolution
Solution
Disillusioned by pollution, resolution starting with...
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine
The spine align, the fetus is mine!
