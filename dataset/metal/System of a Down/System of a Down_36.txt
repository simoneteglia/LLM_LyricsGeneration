[Intro: Serj Tankian]
For today, we will take their body parts
And put them on the wall
[Verse: Serj Tankian]
For treated indigenously, digenously
Human right is private blue chip, pry
For treated indigenously, digenously
(We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry
(Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)
[Chorus: Daron Malakian & Serj Tankian]
You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond, you saw it all
Why did you?
[Verse: Serj Tankian]
For treated indigenously, digenously
(We lost consumer confidence in casual karma, casual karma)
Human right is private blue chip, pry
(Confetti, camouflage, camouflage, the flage, the flage)
For treated indigenously, digenously
(We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry
(Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)
[Chorus: Daron Malakian
with Serj Tankian
]
You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond, you saw it all
Why did you
go there?
[Bridge: Daron Malakian
with Serj Tankian
]
She lost her mind
Someone kicked her into the back of the line
She lost her head
When they called and said that they thought he was dead
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind, I hate these thoughts I can't deny
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind,
I hate these thoughts I can't deâ€“

[Post-Chorus: Daron Malakian]
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Ah, ah, ah-ah
[Bridge: Daron Malakian
with Serj Tankian

Dreamin' of screamin'
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny
Dreamin' of screamin'
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
You will take the body parts and put them on the wall
And bring the dark disaster
