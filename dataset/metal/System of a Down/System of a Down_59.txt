[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I need, I feel, a love, you love to love the fear
I never want to be alone, I've forgotten to
The road keeps moving the clouds, the clouds become unreal
I guess I'll always be at home
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Do you want me to try?
Directing your night
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
An exit lights the sky, the sky becomes complete
Traveling hearts divide the throne
, I've forgotten to
Friction, lines, bumps, the "Highway Song" complete
The signs are all turning right
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Do you want me to try?
Directing your night
Want me to try?
Directing your light
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time
Our days are never coming back
The purest forms of life
Our days are never coming back
The cannons of our time
Our days are never ever coming back
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Our days are never coming back
Our days are never coming back
Our days are never coming back
