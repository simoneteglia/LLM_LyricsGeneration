[Intro: Serj Tankian]
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
Oh
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Following the rights movements, you clamped down with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids
Following the rights movements, you clamped down with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
I buy my crack, I smack my bitch
Right here in Hollywood
Nearly two million Americans are incarcerated
In the prison system, prison system of the U.S
[Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
For you and me to live in
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and me
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Minor drug offenders fill your prisons, you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich
Minor drug offenders fill your prisons, you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
I buy my crack, I smack my bitch
Right here in Hollywood
The percentage of Americans in the prison system
Prison system has doubled since 1985
[Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
For you and me to live in
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and me
For you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison for you and me
Oh, baby, you and me
[Bridge: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
Oh, oh
All research and successful drug policy
Shows that treatment should be increased
Oh
And law enforcement decreased
While abolishing mandatory minimum sentences
Oh
All research and successful drug policy
Shows that treatment should be increased
Oh
And law enforcement decreased
While abolishing mandatory minimum sentences
Utilizing drugs to pay for secret wars around the world
Drugs are now your global policy, now you police the globe
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch
Right here in Hollywood
Drug money is used to rig elections and train brutal
Corporate sponsored dictators around the world
[Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
They're tryna' build a prison
For you and me to live in
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and me
For you and I, you and I, you and I, you and me
They're tryna build a prison
They're tryna build a prison
They're tryna build a prison for you and me
Oh, baby, you and me
