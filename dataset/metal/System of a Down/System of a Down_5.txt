The Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day
Who can believe you? Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar
Sugar
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian
]
I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people call it insane
Yeah, they call it insane (
Sugar
)
I play Russian Roulette every day, a man's sport
With a bullet called life
Yeah, mama called life (
Sugar
)
Yeah and every time I try to go where I really want to be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there
[Chorus: Serj Tankian &
Daron Malakian

The Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day
Who could believe you? Who could believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian &

I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, it's small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket (
Sugar
)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her
And then, ooh baby, she's okay (
Sugar
)
People are always chasing me down
Tryna push my face to the ground
Where all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains
My brains (
Sugar
)
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
The Kombucha mushroom people, sitting around all day
Who can believe you? Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
I sit in my desolate room
No lights, no music
Just anger, I killed everyone
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end, it all goes away
In the end, it all goes away
In the end, it all goes away
In the end, it all goes away
In the end, it all goes away
