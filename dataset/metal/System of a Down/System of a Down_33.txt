[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link, killing with a stink
Just your mother's ho
Bleeding in a sink, poisoning a drink
Burning up, my sweet Clementine
Trampling a shrink, bleeding in a sink
Hallelujah wink, getting on the brink
Just your mother's ho
Hallelujah wink, murdering a shrink, burning up
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
On my sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby
, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Killing with a stink, bleeding in a sink
Poisoning a drink, getting on the brink
Just your mother's ho
Bleeding in a sink, trampling a shrink
Burning up, my sweet Clementine
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link, killing with a stink
Just your mother's ho
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink, burning up
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, oh
[Bridge: Daron Malakian
with Serj Tankian
]
I saw her laugh
Then she said,
"Go away"
I saw her laugh
Then she said,
then she said
"Go away, away"
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
My sweet revenge will be yours, it's in the making
It's in the taking, making, baking, taking, faking
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Ho, my sweet Clementine
Ho, shoulda been, coulda been
Woulda been, woulda been you
Shoulda been, coulda been
Woulda been, woulda been you
