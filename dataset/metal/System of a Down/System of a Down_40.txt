[Verse: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian
]
So I felt like the biggest asshole
(Felt like the biggest asshole)
When I killed your rock 'n' roll
(Mow down the sexy people
)
[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
Every time I look in your eyes
Every day, I'm watching you die
All the thoughts I see in you
About how I
[Verse: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian
]
So I felt like the biggest asshole
(Felt like the biggest asshole)
When I killed your rock 'n' roll
(Mow down the sexy people
)
[Chorus: Serj Tankian with Daron Malakian]
Every time I look in your eyes
Every day, I'm watching you die
All the thoughts I see in you
About how I
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Why?
Why?
[Bridge: Daron Malakian &
Serj Tankian
]
Eat all the grass
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen in the dark
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen in the dark
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen in the dark
Eat all the grass that you want
Accidents happen
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
Every time I look in your eyes
Every day, I'm watching you die
All the thoughts I see in you
About how I
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Why?
Why?
[Outro: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
So, I felt like the biggest asshole
When I killed rock 'n' roll
And I felt like the biggest asshole
When I killed rock 'n' roll
