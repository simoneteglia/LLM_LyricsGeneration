[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Making two possibilities a reality
Predicting the future of things we all know
Fighting off the diseased programming
Of centuries, centuries, centuries, centuries
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Science fails to recognize the single most
Potent element of human existence
Letting the reins go to the unfolding
Is faith, faith, faith, faith
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Science has failed our world
Science has failed our Mother Earth
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Science fails to recognize the single most
Potent element of human existence
Letting the reins go to the unfolding
Is faith, faith, faith, faith
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Science has failed our world
Science has failed our Mother Earth
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
[Instrumental Bridge]
Sim hayastani de anush de im, arevaham barr nem sirum
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Letting the reins go to the unfolding
Is faith, faith, faith, faith
Letting the reins go to the unfolding
Is faith, faith, faith, faith
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Science has failed our world
Science has failed our Mother Earth
[Post-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
Spirit moves through all things
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Science has failed our Mother Earth
