[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Television is disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race
Can you break out, can you break out
Will you live at your own pace?
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Life, so, unnecessary
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Television is disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race
Can you break out, can you break out
Will you live at your own pace?
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
Now will you live at your own pace?
Will you live at your own pace?
