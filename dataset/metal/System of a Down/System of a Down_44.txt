[Verse: Serj Tankian]
I'm, but a little bit-bit-bit, show
But a little bit-bit-bit, shame
But a little bit-bit-bit
Bit! Bit! Bit!
I'm, but a little bit-bit-bit, show
But a little bit-bit-bit, shame
But a little bit-bit-bit
Bit! Bit! Bit!
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I'm just the man in the back
Just the man in the back
Just the man in the back
"tchu tcha tcha"
!
I'm just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the paaaaaaaack!
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
War! Fuck the system
War! Fuck the system, fuck the system
War! Fuck the system
War! I need to fuck the sys, I need to fuck the sys, I need to fuck the sys
[Verse: Serj Tankian]
I'm, but a little bit-bit-bit, show
But a little bit-bit-bit, shame
But a little bit-bit-bit
Bit! Bit! Bit!
I'm, but a little bit-bit-bit, show
But a little bit-bit-bit, shame
But a little bit-bit-bit
Bit! Bit! Bit!
[Pre-Chorus: Serj Tankian]
I'm just the man in the back
Just the man in the back
Just the man in the back
"tchu tcha tcha"
!
I'm just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the paaaaaaaack
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
War! Fuck the system
War! Fuck the system, fuck the system
War! Fuck the system
War! I need to fuck the sys, I need to fuck the sys, I need to fuck the sys
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
"Tum tchic-pah!
Tum tchic-pah!
Tum tchic-pah!
Tum tchic-pah!"
You need to fuck the sys
You need to fuck the sys
You need to fuck the sys
You need to fuck the sys
[Verse: Serj Tankian]
I'm, but a little bit-bit-bit, show
But a little bit-bit-bit, shame
But a little bit-bit-bit
Bit! Bit! Bit!
[Outro: Serj Tankian]
I need to fuck the system
I need to
fuck the sys
I need to fuck the system
We all need to fuck the system!
