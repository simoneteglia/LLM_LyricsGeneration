[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Cursed Earth!
Cursed Earth!
Cursed Earth!
Cursed Earth!
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I will never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart
All because we all live in the valley of the walls
When they speak we can peek from the windows of their mouths
To see the land the women chant as they fly up to the sun
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
You never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, ever think you know why
Know, know, know
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Books all say different things while people flap their yellow wings
Tryna soar, being a whore, life and almost everything
Sheep that ran off from the herd, maybe dead, but now's a bird
Able to fly, able to die, able to fuck your mother's earth
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
You never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, ever think you know why
Know
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
On the other side, the other side, the other side
Do you ever try to fly? Do you ever try to fly?
Have you ever wanted to die? Have you ever wanted to die?
Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly
Don't ever try to fly unless you leave your body on the other side
Never try to die, did you ever try to die?
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Know, you never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, you never think you know why
Know, ever think you know why
Know
