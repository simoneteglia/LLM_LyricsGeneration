[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Peter's pecker picked another pickle bearin' pussy pepper
Peter's pecker picked another pickle bearin' pussy pepper, why?
Meetin' John at Dale's Jr, winked an eye an' point a finger
Meetin' John at Dale's Jr, winked an eye an' point a finger, why?
A former cop, undercover, just got shot, now recovered
A former cop, undercover, just got shot, now recovered, why?
Fightin' crime with a partner, Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter
Fightin' crime with a partner, Lois Lane, Jimmy Carter, *siren*
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
And we light up the sky
[Verse: Serj Tankian]
Peter's pecker picked another pickle bearin' pussy pepper

And we light up the sky
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
And we light up the sky
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Mind illusions acquainted, bubbles erotica
Plutonium wedding rings, icicle stretchings
Bicycles, shoestrings, one flag, flaggy but one
Painting the paintings of the alive
[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
And we light up the sky
I-E-A-I-A-I-O
I-E-A-I-A-I-O, why?
And we light up the sky
