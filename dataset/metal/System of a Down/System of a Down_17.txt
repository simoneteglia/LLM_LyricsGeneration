[Intro: Serj Tankian]
Jump! Bounce! Down! Up!
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Jump! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Bounce! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Down! (Pogo, pogo, pogo) Up! (Pogo, pogo, pogo)
Jump! (Pogo) Bounce! (Pogo) Up! (Pogo) Down! (Pogo)
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I went out on a date with a girl, a bit late
She had so many friends (Gliding through many hands)
I brought my pogo stick just to show her a trick
She had so many friends (Gliding through many hands)
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Jump! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Bounce! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Down! (Pogo, pogo, pogo) Up! (Pogo, pogo, pogo)
Jump! (Pogo) Bounce! (Pogo) Up! (Pogo) Down! (Pogo)
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Unannounced Twister games, all players with no names
They lined up, double quick (But just one pogo stick)
Everyone gets to play,
runaway, expos√©
It was so exotic (But just one pogo stick)
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Jump! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Bounce! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Down! (Pogo, pogo, pogo) Up! (Pogo, pogo, pogo)
Jump! (Pogo) Bounce! (Pogo) Up! (Pogo) Down! (Pogo)
[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Oh, I like to spread you out
Touching whoever's behind
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Jump! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Bounce! (Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
Down! (Pogo, pogo, pogo) Up! (Pogo, pogo, pogo)
Jump! (Pogo) Bounce! (Pogo) Up! (Pogo) Down! (Pogo)
