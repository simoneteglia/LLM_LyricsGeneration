[Verse 1]
Virginia death threat
Virginia creeper vine
The hands that feed intent
Choke the purpose of this time
Take all that you can give
And I will make it mine
No care for what you've spent
Even fool's gold has its shine
[Chorus]
Never held down, never restrained
Virtue's foot to the throat, free of broken chains
Thus always to tyrants
Laugh at the conquered, the victims now betray
[Verse 2]
And in this Commonwealth
There's merely a common concern for self
We hold these lies to be self-evident
As the dividends will reflect
And in this Commonwealth
There's merely a common concern for self
The coffers have long run dry
[Chorus]
Never held down, never restrained
Virtue's foot to the throat, free of broken chains
Thus always to tyrants
Laugh at the conquered, the victims now betray
The victims now betray!
[Bridge]
Like a bull in a china shop
But the shelves have all been cleared
A thief in an empty vault
The sheep
already sheared!
[Verse 3]
Like a bull in a china shop
But the shelves have all been cleared
A thief in an empty vault
The sheep already sheared!
A screen door on a submarine
An eagle with a broken wing
Hope in a dead man's dream
The sound of a bell that will never ring!
[Outro]
Oh, you're just wasting time!
Oh, you're just wasting time!
You're wasting time
