[Verse 1]
The river I'm bound to be found in
(Found in)
A rope chosen, bound for the hang
When I'm blind and I think I see everything
(Everything)
Convincing myself again
[Pre-Chorus]
This god that I worship
(A faded reflection)
This demon I blame
(A flickering flame)
Conspire as one, exactly the same
It's exactly the same
[Chorus]
Descending
To never recover the pieces
To all that we've lost
[Post-Chorus]
Recover
The pieces lost
The pieces
To all we've lost
[Verse 2]
I shudder to think of the consequence
It's blasphemy, simple and true
The tragic protagonist torments
Convincing myself again
[Pre-Chorus]
This god that I worship
(A faded reflection)
This demon I blame
(A flickering flame)
Conspire as one, exactly the same
It's exactly the same
[Chorus]
Descending
To never recover the pieces
To all that we've lost
[Chorus]
Descending
To never recover the pieces
To all that we've lost
[Post-Chorus]
Recover
The pieces lost
The pieces
To all we've lost
[Outro]
This god that I worship
This demon I blame
Conspire as one, exactly the same
It's exactly the same
It's exactly the same
It's exactly the same
