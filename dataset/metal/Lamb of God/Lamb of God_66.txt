[Verse 1]
A human leech
Foul, you crawl into my field of vision
An empty speech
Breaking the skin of concentration
Jesus Christ, you make me sick
Bloated and corpulent from disregard
What you discard
Your presence is leaving a scar
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the night?
[Chorus]
Put you out like the setting sun
Four more words, and then I'm done
How the fuck did you think this would end?
[Verse 2]
A filthy prick
Foul, parasitic imposition
A dirty trick
A seasonal war of attrition
So thoughtless, you're such a pig
Loaded and indolent
And you assume what you consume
Is other's business to reap and remove
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the night?
[Chorus]
Put you out like the setting sun
Four more words, and then I'm done
A violent need to speak the truth
Tired of bone and long of tooth
Let's be clear: you're not welcome here again
How the fuck did you think this would end?
[Post-Chorus]
This is where it ends
This is where it ends
[Bridge]
The swollen fingers
Of the modern age
The human condition
In a gross display
Are covered in the grease of indulgence
Anemic and weak with intemperance
Clutching at the latest distraction
Bleeding the most savage reaction
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the night?
[Chorus]
Put you out like the setting sun
Four more words, and then I'm done
(Get the fuck out)
A violent need to speak the truth
Tired of bone and long of tooth
Let's be clear: you're not wanted here, my friend
How the fuck did you think this would end?
[Outro]
How the fuck did you think this would end?
How the fuck did you think this would end?
