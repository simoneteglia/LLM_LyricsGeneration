[Verse 1]
A sacred cash cow with sickly tits
Dripping temptation for hypocrites
To death, she's beaten; the prosperous
Endlessly stating the obvious
[Pre-Chorus]
Caught in your words, sever the knot this time
Somebody show me their true...
[Chorus]
Face me once as I leave all that I despise
Face me as I unleash this hate refined
[Verse 2]
Indict the blameless, transparent designs
Pathetic and shameless, crucified!
A legend in his own mind, enthroned by lies
A cheap Machiavelli plots his demise
[Pre-Chorus]
Caught in your words, sever the knot this time
Somebody show me their true...
[Chorus]
Face me once as I leave all that I despise
Face me as I unleash this hate refined
Face me as I leave all this far behind
Face me as I unleash this hate refined!
[Bridge]
What once gave life
Now infested with plague
The lamb lies with maggots
Blinded, gagged, betrayed
What once gave life
Now infested with plague
The lamb lies with maggots
The corpse bloated with rage
[Outro]
Face these eyes
Hate refined
