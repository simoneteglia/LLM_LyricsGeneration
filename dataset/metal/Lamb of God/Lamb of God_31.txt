[Verse 1]
No one lives forever, but you can't escape from life
Every day could be your last, so consider your demise
Mine has drawn so near, stare into the eyes of the end
Leaping now without fear, the time that's left to spend
[Pre-Chorus]
The time that's left to spend!
The time that's left to…
[Chorus]
Look up in the night, see me ride across the sky
Hanging there above, far away, but so nearby
I am the smoke on the wind, burning in your eyes
Cast aside an empty shell, but I will never die
[Verse 2]
This world has grown too small, I can't stay much longer
My body begins to fail as my spirit grows stronger
It's time for me to go, the circle closed as the snake eats its tail
Lay my burden down, walking free beyond the veil
[Pre-Chorus]
No time is left to spend!
The time that's left to…
[Chorus]
Look up in the night, see me ride across the sky
Hanging there above, far away, but so nearby
I am the smoke on the wind, burning in your eyes
Cast aside an empty shell, but I will never die
[Bridge]
I will never die
I will never die
I will never die
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Look up in the night, see me ride across the sky
Hanging there above, far away, but so nearby
I am the smoke on the wind, burning in your eyes
Cast aside an empty shell, but I will never die
[Outro]
I will never die
Never die
I will never die
