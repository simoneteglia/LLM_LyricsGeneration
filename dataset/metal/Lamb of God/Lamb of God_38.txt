[Intro]
Bled of all you had to lose
[Verse 1]
I can feel your fear and weakness
I see my own in the mirrors of your eyes
Carved into a corner hopeless
There's death ahead and doom behind
There's a bad storm blowing in
And most of us won't make it
The wreckage of your past
Means nothing now, forsake it
[Refrain]
The memories cripple you
You're torn apart, your doubt must
[Chorus]
Die
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken hands
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken hands
[Verse 2]
Well, there's those that do
And those that just do talking
We're all going through hell
It's burn or keep on walking
The blackguards sing their shanty
Pure death riding the wind
Right now, it's do-or-die
How will you choose to live?
[Refrain]
The memories that ruin you
You're torn apart, your doubt must
[Chorus]
Die
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken hands
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken hands
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
You best delay self-pity
Locked in devastation's throes
The noose awaits you swinging
A blade of malice cuts the rope
Hostility ensues
No attempt to repent
Your struggles vindicate
The illest of intent
[Chorus]
Die
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken hands
It only fell apart 'cause you let it
Bled of all you had to lose
Pick up the pieces with your broken hands
[Outro]
With your broken hands
