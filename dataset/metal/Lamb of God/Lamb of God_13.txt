[Verse 1: Lyrics by Steve Austin]
All the fucked-up things
Trap and punish me
I cannot explain
My problem
Kill my hopeless life
I cannot be hypnotized
You owed me, you owe me
[Verse 2: Lyrics by David Randall Blythe]
Push and force aside the veil to
Welcome in the visitors
Eyes like halogen
Illuminate the
Soma peering out
Of spherical night mask
Paleolithic
Subconscious icons
Lumber through dream
Scape (?) archetype of archangel
Terror and hubris
Terror and hubris
Infants painted gauze
Peer through murky jars
Soon, I'm wearing the skin
Of the morning star
Green locks my name
Fills an empty banner
Frank, what have you gotten me into now?
[Verse 3: Lyrics by Steve Austin, then David Randall Blythe]
I am not afraid to speak my heart and mind
It cannot be saved, sell me over
Fuck your hopeless world
I am blacker than the sun
Tragedy, tragedy
Have you seen the speedy, yes?
Bleeds through sleep onto the page
I'm sailin'...
I'm sailin'...
I'm sailin'...
I'm sailin'...
It must be done!
It must be done!
It must be done!
It must be done!
