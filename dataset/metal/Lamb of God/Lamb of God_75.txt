[Verse 1]
You always needed people like me
Directions for your fingers to point
A crooked dealer's blaming spree
I'm guaranteed to disappoint
You're weak and scared and cutting raw deals
But fortune always favors the bold
I'll bet it all and crush your bluff
I'll never yield nor ever fold
[Refrain]
And I won't shoulder the blame
[Chorus]
I am the one who's left to take the fall
I fight the constant undertow
[Verse 2]
You always needed a distraction
A target for the stones that you throw
To draw attention from your actions
I'm tailor-made, so lock and load
Oh, you're telling tales
You spineless coward
Your word's not worth its weight in shit
Back against the wall, belligerent
[Refrain]
I won't shoulder the blame
[Pre-Chorus]
So high and mighty
But when the bottom drops out
You're gonna find me
Standing where you left me
[Chorus]
I am the one who's left to take the fall
I fight the constant undertow
[Bridge]
I fight the constant undertow
I fight the constant undertow!
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Deal the last hand
Let the cards fall where they may
From your castle made of sand
You're looking down at me
So high and mighty
But when the bottom drops out
You'll have to face me
Waiting where you left me!
[Chorus]
I am the one who's left to take the fall
I fight the constant undertow
[Outro]
The undertow
The undertow
