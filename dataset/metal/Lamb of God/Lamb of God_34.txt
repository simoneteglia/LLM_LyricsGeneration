[Intro]
Endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
Whipping the nightmares to a froth
Endless questions with no answers
No replacement for what's been lost
Lost
[Verse 1]
Everything suffocates in the dust
Of past fortunes squandered
The empire of lies
To whom you pandered
Suffer a self-imposed exile
The bitter fruits of denial
In the presence of greatness
The humble can only bow
[Chorus]
Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
For an eternal winter
[Verse 2]
Tell me a lie
With the best of intentions
Mute in the age
Of mass communication
Dark days lead to darker nights
Frozen, out of time
Id dies for blessed ego
The once mighty laid low
[Chorus]
Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
[Post-Chorus]
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter
[Outro]
You taught me hate, I'll teach you fear
(Fear, fear, fear, fear)
Open the eyes, kill despair
You tried to squeeze the life from me
(From me, from me)
Son of a bitch, I'm going to break you
Son of a bitch, I'm going to break you!
Break you, I'm going to break you
Break you!
