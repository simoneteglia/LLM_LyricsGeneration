[Verse 1]
You came from heavens throne
Acquainted with our sorrow
To trade the debt we owe
Your suffering for our freedom
[Chorus]
The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out, my sin erased
It was my death You died, I am raised to life
Hallelujah, the lamb of God
[Verse 2]
My name upon Your heart
My shame upon Your shoulders
The power of sin undone
The cross for my salvation
[Chorus]
The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out, my sin erased
It was my death You died, I am raised to life
Hallelujah, the lamb of God
[Bridge]
There is no greater love
There is no greater love
The Savior lifted up
There is no greater love, no
There is no greater love
There is no greater love
The Savior lifted up
There is no greater love!
[Chorus]
The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out, my sin erased
It was my death You died, I am raised to life
Hallelujah, the lamb of God, oh, yeah
The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out, my sin erased
It was my death You died, I am raised to life
Hallelujah, the lamb of God
