[Verse 1]
A celebration to swell the system
Mass casualties, Earth's war of attrition
A slate-colored moment in an amber time
Nothing to do but move the needle down the line
[Refrain]
Move it down the line
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ride the plague winds
Back to where we were before
Moving through the night
Illuminate the killing floor
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Breathing here
Bleeding here
[Chorus]
Divided here together
To sing a dеadly song
Divided here togеther
To sing a deadly song
September
[Verse 2]
A confrontation over existence
Past tragedies creating resistance
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more
Where poison is the balm and endless dead ignored
[Refrain]
The dead ignored
[Pre-Chorus 1]
The lights upon the blacktop
Raise a toast of arsenic
Fill the coffers, roll the dice
Amusements for the sick
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Breathing here
Bleeding here
[Chorus]
Divided here together
To sing a deadly song
Divided here together
To sing a deadly song
September!
We sing a deadly song
Divided here together
We sing a deadly song
September
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Bridge]
We're broken in half, mindset split
Stitched together, this game of Russian roulette
One in the chamber, head full of doubt
More food for the crows who ride it out
We'll ride it out
[Outro]
Divided here together (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Breathing here together (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Divided here together (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bleeding here together
September
