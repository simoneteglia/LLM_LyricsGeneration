[Verse 1]
The knowledge
That seeking
The favor of another
Means the murder of self
[Chorus]
This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away
[Verse 2]
Silence speeds the path to your streams of solace
That run so few and narrow
Brooks that babble the sounds of torture
The sounds of torture, you will one day rise
To flood the banks of the chosen
[Chorus]
This is the art of ruin
This is the resolution
The end of all progress
The death of evolution
It bleeds all life away
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
It bleeds all life away!
Go!
[Outro]
I will show you
All that I have mastered
Fear, pain, hatred, power!
This is the art of ruin
This is the art of ruin
This is the art of ruin
