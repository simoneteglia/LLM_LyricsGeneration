[Verse 1]
Allocate your future to the delegates
Relegate your muses to the surrogates
Long, green apron strings that end in hooks
Sunk deep, written off, and on the books
Ripped off, a weak, derivative culture
Disposable, nothing's built to last
Whipped dogs, a bleak cognitive future
Ineptitude is reaching critical mass
[Pre-Chorus]
A generation of mockingbirds
You are being herded by the wolves
A generation of mockingbirds
Feeding yourself to the wolves
[Chorus]
This is the rise of our demise
Fucked up and uncivilized
This is the rise of our demise
You paint a target right between your eyes
[Verse 2]
Collateral damage in the aggregates
Structural analysis of duplicates
Errors of illusion, clouded perspectives
Terrorized delusions and endgame objectives
Locked out, a stiff tactical suture
A victim complex now reality
Blocked ground, a swift statistical maneuver
Persecution of the self-made weak
[Pre-Chorus]
A generation of mockingbirds
You are being herded by the wolves
A generation of mockingbirds
Feeding yourself to the wolves
[Chorus]
This is the rise of our demise
Fucked up and uncivilized
This is the rise of our demise
You paint a target right between your eyes
[Bridge: Spoken]
And now is the moment when everything can change
You are completely responsible for your own life
And no one is coming to save you from yourself
So, stop blaming your problems on any and everything else
It does not matter one tiny fucking bit
How unfair you think the world is
It's only what you do right here, right now!
Right this fucking instant that matters, it's your choice to...
[Breakdown]
Sink or swim, sink or swim
Sink or swim, sink or swim
[Outro]
It's imminent, the rise of your demise
Sink or swim
It's all around, the rise of your demise
Sink or swim!
