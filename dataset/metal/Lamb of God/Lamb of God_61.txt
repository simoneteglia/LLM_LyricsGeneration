[Verse 1: Randy Blythe]
A black snake beneath the ground
Extinction dripping from his mouth
Poisons water, hearts of men
Who choke the sky and rape the land
A legacy of endless greed
And manifested destiny
Draws a map of stolen names
The truth is known but nothing's changed
[Chorus: Randy Blythe
with Chuck Billy
]
But on the bitter winds
We fly
I come to you
I come to you
To where
the seven fires
burn
We ride
To stand with you
To stand with you
[Verse 2: Randy Blythe]
One hundred years and more have passed
Since
blood was spilled that greased the grass
Across the river hired guns
Are standing on a hill of bones
They built a deadly liquid road
A deed to that which can't be owned
Beneath the eyes of iron hawks
I stand with those who won't be bought
[Chorus: Randy Blythe
with Chuck Billy
]
Yes, on the bitter winds
We fly
I come to you
I come to you
To where the seven fires burn
We ride
To stand with you
We ride
To stand with you
[Bridge: Randy Blythe]
A black snake beneath the ground
Extinction dripping from his mouth
Poisons water, hearts of men
Who choke the sky and rape the land
[Refrain: Randy Blythe]
I stand with you
[Outro: Randy Blythe
with Chuck Billy
]
To the sky
Voices singing
On and on
Never ending
In the night
Drums are beating
On and on
Never ending
