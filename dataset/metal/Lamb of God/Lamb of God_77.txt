[Verse 1]
Everything you've ever begged me to be
Could never have meant any less to me
Everything you've ever asked me to say
It's so far away from the truth
[Pre-Chorus]
So far away from the truth
So far away
[Chorus]
Fake messiah
Stitches sewn in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
[Verse 2]
Over and over and ever again
Defending your insignificance
Useless intent hidden behind your mask
A coward's face, anonymous
[Pre-Chorus]
So far away from the truth
So far away
[Chorus]
Fake messiah
Stitches sewn in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Fake messiah
Open mouth, drawing flies
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Denied
[Bridge]
Generation failure
Suspended in irrelevance
Slit you wide open
Just to see what you're made of
Just to see what you're made of
[Pre-Chorus]
So far away from the truth
[Chorus]
Fake messiah
Stitches sewn in your eyes
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
Fake messiah
Open mouth, drawing flies
Fake messiah
Prophecy now denied
[Outro]
Messiah
Fake messiah
Fake messiah
