[Verse 1]
Broken bones and the will
Capacity to disappear in misery saves
Soaking, pain as a thrill, hate to instill
Compassion's a cage
[Chorus]
Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again
[Verse 2]
Sunken, sooner or later
We crawl our way back into our favorite hole
Drunken, swallow the savior
And follow him to hang from the highest pole
[Chorus]
Forgiving the father
Read the story on my skin
Tell me more about the man I should have been
I'll be the martyr
Falling from his grace again
Falling from his grace again
[Bridge]
This is where the end begins
The end begins
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Falling from his grace again
Falling from his grace again
This is where the end begins
