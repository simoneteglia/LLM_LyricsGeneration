[Verse 1]
How precious is the One who bore my sin
How beautiful the hands that drew me in
The Savior of the world
The One who's not contained by time or space
The One who lit the stars and knows my name
The Savior of the world, the Savior of the world
[Chorus]
Behold the risen Lamb of God
The Cornerstone, our solid rock
Jesus, Your name will echo through eternity
The One that Hell could not contain
The One who left an empty grave
Jеsus, Your name will echo through etеrnity
[Verse 2]
How beautiful the song that Heaven sings
Forever lifted high, we let it ring
Oh the song of the redeemed, oh the song of the redeemed
[Chorus]
Behold the risen Lamb of God
The Cornerstone, our solid rock
Jesus, Your name will echo through eternity
The One that Hell could not contain
The One who left an empty grave
Jesus, Your name will echo through eternity
[Bridge]
Fire in His eyes, love in His veins
Conquering King, who's mighty to save
Demons acknowledge the powerful name of Jesus
Fire in His eyes, love in His veins
Conquering King, who's mighty to save
Creation bows down to the powerful name of Jesus
Fire in His eyes, love in His veins
Conquering King, who's mighty to save
Forever and ever we sing out the name of Jesus
[Chorus]
Behold the risen Lamb of God
The Cornerstone, our solid rock
Jesus, Your name will echo through eternity
The One that Hell could not contain
The One who left an empty grave
Jesus, Your name will echo through eternity
Jesus, Your name will echo through eternity
Jesus, Your name will echo through eternity
