[Verse 1]
Bearing westward, hell-bound on old 66
I'm out for answers, wind up with just bloody kicks
A pocket Jesus to light your path
A techno-messiah, enraptured crash
[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't make this shit up
The truth is bad enough
Out in the heartlands, a smoking wreck
Of ill-raised children and lost respect
[Chorus]
Let me sell you illusions of concern
An endless loop of drown and burn
Worship while we tell you lies to your face
The bottom line, a cheap disgrace
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Electro-lemmings line up to storm the cliff
The paying victims create a rapid shift
To empty commerce and wasted words
A celebration of the thinning herd
[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't make this shit up
The truth is bad enough
Out in the heartlands, a smoking wreck
Of ill-raised children and lost respect
[Chorus]
Let me sell you illusions of concern
An endless loop of drown and burn
Worship while we tell you lies to your face
The bottom line, a cheap disgrace
[Bridge]
It's a fucking disgrace
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't make this shit up
The truth is bad enough
Out in the heartlands, a smoking wreck
Of ill-raised children and lost respect
[Chorus]
Let me sell you illusions of concern
An endless loop of drown and burn
Worship while we tell you lies to your face
The bottom line, a cheap disgrace
Bearing westward
, I couldn't make this shit up
I'm out for answers
Worship while we tell you lies to your face
The bottom line, a cheap disgrace
[Outro]
It's a cheap disgrace
