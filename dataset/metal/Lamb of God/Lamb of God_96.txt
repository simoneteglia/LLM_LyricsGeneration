[Verse 1]
A moment in time worthy only of solitude
Its grandeur not meant for another to see
Are we the abandoned? Are we the deserter?
Liveth thee not so as wicked as we
The tracers light up their screens
As the wealthy cash in on the war
As the body counts rise, the ratings will soar (Ratings will soar)
Another deceiver, the liar, the patriot
Counting the lies and keeping the score, the score
[Pre-Chorus]
Look in the light
Face the fate that deserves you
You are the hunted, the victim
The prey and the fallen
[Chorus]
We die alone
We die alone
We die alone
We die alone
[Verse 2]
A lamb in the line of the led to the slaughter
Another to join all the ghosts from before (Join all the ghosts from before)
Another believer, another casualty
Can't tell the way out from a chain to the floor, the floor
[Pre-Chorus]
Look in the light
Face the fate that deserves you
You are the hunted, the victim
The prey and the fallen
[Chorus]
We die alone
We die alone
We die alone
We die alone
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
We die alone
We die alone
We die alone
We die alone
