[Intro]
Witness shame's parade
The pain of blame repaid
It's fucking hopeless
Accusations and denial
[Verse 1]
Hopeless...
Demon of another day
Colorless...
Stoned, solid gray
Emptiness...
Of promises I made
So faithless...
The tenants long betrayed
[Chorus]
Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Silence
The only promise ever kept
[Verse 2]
Familiar touch
A ritual to numb the cut
Salvation in vice
Anguish is realizing
What could have been but never was
It's emptiness that fills the cup
Devotion in
The method of my fall
Pointless...
Futility continuing
Endless...
Flowing corrupted vein
[Chorus]
Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Silence
The only promise ever kept
[Outro]
It's fucking hopeless
Hopeless
Hopeless
It's fucking hopeless
Hopeless!
