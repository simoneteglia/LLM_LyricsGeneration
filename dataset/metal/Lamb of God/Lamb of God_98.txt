[Verse 1]
Satellite transmission
Spit spores into the atmosphere
Signal wave distortion
Corrupted files reengineered
Digital conception
Electric god's eye overseer
Redacted mass deception
Fractured glowing glass veneer
[Chorus]
State of unrest, witness what you've created
Pathogenic, unabated
We are chaos detonated
State of unrest, witness what you've created
We are chaos detonated
[Verse 2]
Intravenous network
Plunger push keep us sedate
Data mass collector
Pull the plug and wipe the slate
Executive defector
Fear and hate indoctrinate
Globally infected
Inseminated mass mutate
[Chorus]
State of unrest, witness what you've created
Pathogenic, unabated
We are chaos detonated
State of unrest, witness what you've created
We are chaos detonated
[Post-Chorus]
We are chaos detonated
[Outro]
We are chaos detonated
We are chaos detonated
We are chaos detonated
