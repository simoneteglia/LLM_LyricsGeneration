[Intro]
That's cool
I got the DI
I didn't do it yet
I got the DI
I didn't do it yet
It's to a click, Mark!
Alright, sweet
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Watch the gears grind off their teeth, the screeching halt machine
Digging heels in disbelief
Two reactional identities, opposing policies
A bait and switch routine
Double takes and double-speak
Still scripting the facade
Asphyxiate and choke the truth
All hail the money god
[Chorus]
Repeat, echo, refrain
It's all the same, so deafening
Repeat, echo, refrain
A consequence, we asked for this
Repeat, echo, refrain
No, never again
The American scream
[Verse 2]
A
coup d'état
on full display, a liar's sick charade
A traitor's grand parade
Narcissistic masquerades for those without a say
Systematic disarray
Divide and conquer and close them in
And bury secrets deep
Make America hate again
And bleed the sheep to sleep
[Chorus]
Repeat, echo, refrain
It's all the same, so deafening
Repeat, echo, refrain
A consequence, we asked for this
Repeat, echo, refrain
No, never again
The American scream
(Scream)
[Bridge]
You try to pick the lesser of
But evil doesn't come in twos
Bellicose and Balkanized
A sinking ship of fools
So kiss the hangman as you drop
The rotting corpse of decency
Just another casualty of the American scream
Scream
The American scream
[Chorus]
Repeat, echo, refrain
It's all the same, so deafening
Repeat, echo, refrain
A consequence, we asked for this
Repeat, echo, refrain
No, never again
The American scream
Never again
