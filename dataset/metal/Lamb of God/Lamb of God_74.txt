[Verse 1]
Sloth is the enemy of greatness
Reflection, a scalpel to my mind
We strive as you leisurely criticize
A free ride, until you find that
You've dug your own grave
Lie by lie
[Chorus]
Just a running mouth
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan
[Post-Chorus]
You've dug your own grave
With your spite
You've dug your own grave
Lie by lie
[Verse 2]
A cancer that needs to be cut out
Sweet slander, the razor to your throat
Trim the fat, a loose end
To be tied up and cast aside
Left to find that
You've dug your own grave
With your spite
[Chorus]
Just a running mouth
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six
Leviathan
[Bridge]
A relentless imposition
By a self-fulfilling travesty
From one who is just rotting there
In slut's wool and zero history
Aesthetic condemning
Erratic condescending!
An empty barrel always makes the most noise
And I begin to feel my hands
My hands
around your throat!
Your throat!
Erratic condescending!
[Pre-Chorus]
You've dug your own grave
With your spite
You've dug your own grave
Lie by lie
[Chorus]
Just a running mouth
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six, leviathan
Poison words you throw about
Drag you to your end
The number six, leviathan
[Outro]
You've dug your own grave
You've dug your own grave
The number six
Leviathan!
You've dug your own grave
A running mouth!
You've dug your own grave
And poison words!
You've dug your own grave
Will be your end!
The number six
Leviathan!
