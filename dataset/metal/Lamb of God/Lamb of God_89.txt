[Verse 1]
Greet the day smiling with a hateful heart
Run to finish before I ever start
Stalk through paradise with a gun in my hand
Following to pieces in the promised land
[Pre-Chorus]
I've done my part to make the world like this
A glass that's filled to the rim with wine and piss
[Chorus]
Hit or miss
It's a roll of the dice
It's pain or bliss
Whatever arrives
You can't stop the tide
It's hit or miss
[Verse 2]
I'm collapsing beneath joy and pain
Grotesquely clean but beautifully stained
Resentment keeps rebuilding me inside
Feels like I'm drinking poison but expecting you to die
[Pre-Chorus]
I've done my part to make the world like this
A glass that's filled to the rim with wine and piss
[Chorus]
Hit or miss
It's a roll of the dice
It's pain or bliss
Whatever arrives
You can't stop the tide
It's hit or miss
[Bridge]
I came to make amends
To do the right thing
I came to corrupt your children
To kill the king
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
I've done my part to make the world like this
Now a glass that's filled to the rim with wine and piss
[Chorus]
Hit or miss
It's a roll of the dice
It's pain or bliss
Whatever arrives
You can't stop the tide
It's hit or miss
[Outro]
Hit or miss
Hit or miss
Whatever arrives
You can't stop the tide
A roll of the dice
It's hit or miss
