[Verse 1]
Down South soldier
Third World soldier
My vengeance will be swift and terrible
Many will die
I am the distance between two points
Forgotten, a void
I dig holes, brother
Well, I've got a bone to pick
And a nerve to pluck
A skin to get under
And a home to wreck
I've got ends to meet
So I've got a job to do
[Chorus]
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will
[Bridge]
Stick to your guns
The difference is mine are loaded
Taste the sting of your arrogance
Stuck in this screeching bitch called life
Drop the coins
And send you down to
Charon
[Verse 2]
I will have my vengeance
In this life or the next
Well, I've got a sucker to punch
And a back to stab
A head to kick in
And a throat to slit
[Pre-Chorus]
I've got a job to do
Harsh and unrepentant
I've got a job to do
Harsh and unrepentant
[Chorus]
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will
[Outro]
Step back before you're the next to get served
With some Southern hospitality
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will
Step back before you're the next to get served
With some Southern hospitality
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will
