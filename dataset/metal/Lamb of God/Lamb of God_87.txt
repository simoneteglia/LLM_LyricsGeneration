[Verse 1]
Can the pestilence within you be bled out?
May I have the honor of this amputation?
Know that you have made an enemy
To show you the meaning of indignity
I live now solely for the pleasure
Of your slow decay
[Bridge]
Feel the pain of
Vengeance burn you
Soon, you shall know
Silence, silence
[Verse 2]
With trembling hands, you'll beg for mercy
I'll show you none, I'll show you none
[Bridge]
Purified by my hand
In this, my world
In this, my world
It is salvation
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Your futile existence
Draws to a close
A cloak of lies drops
The lies drop
The lies drop
