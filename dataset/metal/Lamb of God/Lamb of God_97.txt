[Verse 1]
There's a war going on inside my head
Shadows sewn of golden thread
I sip the sweetest tastes until their bitter ends
I feel the greatest love inside the worst revenge
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cold rain falls on my face
And the light in my hand
I’m turning inside out
I don't know who I am
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And do I want it to stop?
[Chorus]
Grayscale eyes slide
From black to white
Lived through dark days
Stillness in a crashing wave
Died in bright nights
Fall into an angry sky
Grayscale eyes slide
From black to white
[Post-Chorus]
In a grayscale tide
[Verse 2]
There's a war going on inside of me
Questions echo endlessly
I paid a thief to steal away my one escape
I bought a broken mirror just to try and see my face
[Pre-Chorus]
Cold winds blow from the hills
There’s eyes on my back
In sinking, shifting sands
I don't know where I am
[Chorus]
Grayscale eyes slide
From black to white
Lived through dark days
Stillness in a crashing wave
Died in bright nights
Fall into an angry sky
Grayscale eyes slide
From black to white
[Post-Chorus]
In a grayscale tide
In a grayscale tide
[Bridge]
I thought I'd know better now
The world is upside down
I thought I'd know better now
The weight is crashing down
[Chorus]
Grayscale eyes slide
From black to white
Lived through dark days
Stillness in a crashing wave
Died in bright nights
Fall into an angry sky
Grayscale eyes slide
From black to white
[Post-Chorus]
In a grayscale tide
