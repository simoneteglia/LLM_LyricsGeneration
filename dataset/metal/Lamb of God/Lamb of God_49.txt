[Intro]
Omens
Omens
[Verse 1]
I cut the weight of connection
And lead myself astray
The end will justify the means
But in the end, it stays the same
There's nothing left at all
Nothing left to see
A restrictive, empty exercise
Within a hollow scheme
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you see the...
[Chorus]
Omens? Omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
Omens, omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
[Pre-Verse]
An endless recitation thrown
Right through the looking glass
I’m trappеd inside a parody
A fabricated past
[Verse 2]
Searching for rеlease
From all this rising stress
Charted past the point of caring
With a broken compass
Motes in the eye of God
Indulging Armageddon
The devil slits the muse's throat
And drinks her last confession
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you see the...
[Chorus]
Omens? Omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
Omens, omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Bridge]
I've fallen out of touch
With who you think I am
I can’t pretend to care
Or bother to condemn
All this rising apathy
It's growing every day
I can't pretend to care
About how this will end
[Pre-Chorus]
All I see...
[Chorus]
Are omens, omens
Fuck it all, ignore the omens
I see omens, I hear omens
I say, fuck it all, ignore the omens
