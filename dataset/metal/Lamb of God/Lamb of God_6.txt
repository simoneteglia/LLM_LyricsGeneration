[Intro]
Six bars laid across the sky
Four empty walls to fill the time
One careless word, you lose your life
A grave new world awaits inside
[Verse 1]
Lycanthropic survival instincts
Embrace the beast and shun the weak
Awake the primal one that sleeps inside
Or feel the shiver running through your spine
[Refrain]
The time is slipping by, no peace in sight
But the teeth of time still hold their bite
[Chorus]
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself, I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
,
my hands are painted red
[Verse 2]
Schizophrenic amnesia
Bid goodbye to all you knew and loved
Forget the only life that you knew outside
They bought the ticket, now you take the ride
[Refrain]
The time is slipping by, no peace in sight
But the teeth of time still hold their bite
[Chorus]
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself, I've become someone else
My hands are painted red, my hands are painted red
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Another number quickly learns the rules
A hidden burner waits to point at you
A subtle gesture, and you're ventilated
Talk isn't cheap here, bleed out in payment
Six bars laid across the sky
Four empty walls to fill the time!
[Chorus]
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself, I've become someone else
My hands are painted red, my hands are painted
Red, red, red, red!
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself, I've become someone else
My hands are painted red, my hands are painted red
