[Intro]
One, two, three
[Verse 1]
Do you remember when word was bond?
A fleeting promise in the light of the dawn
Barren December under a falling sky
The end of days and a reason to die
[Pre-Chorus]
Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time
[Chorus]
You lived through hell
Now you're trying to die
The skin is healed
But you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
[Verse 2]
Night blind on the shining path
Ghost walking in the aftermath
Hypnotized, 60-cycle hum
The broken cadence of a distant drum
Twenty-one to one, I'm liking the odds
A blood junkie with a lightning rod
A dirty rig and a heavenly nod
And still, you wind up nowhere
[Pre-Chorus]
Obliteration never looked so divine
Holding your breath for the moment in time
[Chorus]
You lived through hell
Now you're trying to die
The skin is healed
But you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
[Post-Chorus]
There's no one left to save
There's no one left to save
[Bridge]
You
You chased the dragon, but it followed you home
You
You're lost the fever dreams and broken hope
Lost
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Desolation never looked so divine
Promise yourself for the very last time
[Chorus]
You lived through hell
Now you're trying to die
The skin is healed
But you're bleeding inside
Shots fired just to numb the pain
There's no one left to save
[Post-Chorus]
There's no one left to save
There's no one left
A fever dream
There's no one left to save
Shots forever end the pain
There's no one left to save
