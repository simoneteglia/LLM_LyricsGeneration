[Intro]
Welcome home to my reality
So, you taste yourself every time?
Bitter must be your pleasure
This, your
swan song
, I'll sing for you
[Verse 1]
I'll cut the words from your mouth
You'll never speak my name again
Locked up and sold the fuck out
Don't think you won't see me again
[Refrain]
It'll come back three times
Once in the name of deceit
Twice for your malice
Three times when I take you away
[Verse 2]
This is a homicide daydream
I won't waste my hate on you
All that you've claimed not to be
Has now come to define you
[Refrain]
It'll come back three times
Once in the name of regret
Twice for your envy
Three times when I take you away
[Bridge]
Turn on my heels and
Spit apathy on
This bridge you have burnt
[Verse 3]
Feast on my own blood
I'll drain myself to sleep
I'll rise from death to knife this beast
These last regrets, the ones I keep
[Refrain]
It'll come back three times
Once in the name of deceit
Twice for your malice
Three times when I take you away
[Outro]
Three times when I take you away
Three times when I take you away
Three times when I take you away
