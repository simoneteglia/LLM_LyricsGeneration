[Verse 1]
A message in the bottle
Smashed right across your head
All those years of screaming out
The words you never read
Sucking on a xenon tit
All hail the cretin king
Apprentice to an idiot
A sycophantic dream
[Pre-Chorus]
They say jump, you ask how high
And watch your freedom die...
[Chorus]
What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What will you believe? Who will you betray?
What's the cost of victory?
[Verse 2]
You always took the easy road
You always compromised
You never put the effort in
To read between the lines
Rutting in a garbage pit
Embracе the weaker breed
Join thе pack of rabid dogs
And lick the hand that beats
[Pre-Chorus]
On the cattle car, full speed ahead
Your ticket to regret
[Chorus]
What will you believe?
Who will you betray?
What will you believe? Who will you betray?
What's the cost of victory?
[Bridge]
A screaming paradigm of dysfunction
A superficial sea of reaction
A violent passion surrogate
You tied the noose around your own neck
[Outro]
What will you believe? Who will you betray?
What is the cost of victory?
What will you believe? Who will you betray?
What is the cost of victory?
The cost of victory!
