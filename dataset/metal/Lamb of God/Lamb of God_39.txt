[Verse 1]
Somewhere between an excuse and a lie
You found something that you believe
So proud, I guess I can't imagine why
Three cheers for what we used to be
[Chorus]
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
[Post-Chorus]
Sleepwalking the minefield
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around
[Verse 2]
Somewhere between illusion and denial
You'll drown in your own sympathy
Profound, at least you thought so at the time
A ghost of who you used to be
[Chorus]
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
[Post-Chorus]
Sleepwalking the minefield
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around, it comes back around
Sleepwalking the minefield
Shit talking, it crumbles around you
It comes back around
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
[Breakdown]
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised
Pathetic, wasted
Soulless, compromised!
