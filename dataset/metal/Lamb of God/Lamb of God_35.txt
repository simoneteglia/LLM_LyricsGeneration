[Verse 1]
Anxious steps every day through the halls of learning
She's watching every corner, she's praying for a warning
She's just a child of eight years old already scared to die
And no one's done a fucking thing but watch the bullets fly
Our nerves are cobwebbed with the dust of atrocity
The deadly daily spectacle erodes humanity
Jaded and desensitized, a spreading apathy
Fast forgotten thoughts and prayers for numbers on a screen
(For numbers on a screen)
[Chorus]
Another massacre, another day gone by
Is this the new abnormal?
Pursuing illusions as we turn a blind eye
This is the new abnormal
[Verse 2]
Anguished steps through the ashes of a blackened plain
He used to walk the jungle there in perfect harmony
He's an old man of eighty years, last of a different world
Progress has wiped his people out, they never will return
Out of sight, out of our minds, four thousand miles away
Our willful ignorance will turn this home into a grave
The air is getting thinner, our lungs are set ablaze
We've consumed ourselves to death, catastrophe
(More numbers on a screen)
[Chorus]
Another massacre, another day gone by
Is this the new abnormal?
Pursuing illusions as we turn a blind eye
This is the new abnormal
[Bridge]
Slip so easily into dull indifference
When horror has been normalized, a cynical defense
But I can't sit there silently and watch it all go by
The strongest hearts will raise their voice against the murderous tide
(No!) No, it can't go on like this
Millions of voices echo in the darkness, screaming
No (No!), I won't accept this
The faint of heart will fall in line but I will not submit
[Chorus]
Another massacre, another day gone by
Is this the new abnormal?
Pursuing illusions as we turn a blind eye
This is the new abnormal
[Outro]
(More numbers on a screen)
Reject the new abnormal
