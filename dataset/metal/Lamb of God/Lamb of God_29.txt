[Verse]
Behold the Lamb of God
Who takes away our sin
Behold the Lamb of God
The life and light of men
Behold the Lamb of God
Who died and rose again
Behold the Lamb of God who comes
To take away our sin
[Chorus]
Broken hearts (Behold our broken hearts)
Fallen far (We need You)
Behold the sin of man
[Verse]
Behold the Lamb of God
Who takes away our sin
Behold the Lamb of God
The life and light of men
Behold the Lamb of God
Who died and rose again
Behold the Lamb of God who comes
To take away our sin
[Chorus]
Son of God (Emmanuel)
Son of Man (We praise You)
Behold the Lamb, the hope of man
Behold the Lamb
[Verse]
Behold the Lamb of God
Who takes away our sin
Behold the Lamb of God
The life and light of men
Behold the Lamb of God
Who died and rose again
Behold the Lamb of God who comes
To take away our sin
