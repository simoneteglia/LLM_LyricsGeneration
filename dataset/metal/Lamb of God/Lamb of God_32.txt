[Intro]
Rise!
[Verse 1]
Store-bought attitude and spit
A sugarcoated piece of shit
An instant rebel, just add greed
Another useless commodity
Broken glass and a broken jaw
Lies are told in a Southern drawl
Poorhouse poverty's your schtick
The real thing would kill you quick
[Chorus]
Rise!
Again, we will rise!
Rise!
Again, we will rise!
[Verse 2]
Blood and fire used to fill the night
Burned and drowned by our very lives
You missed a sinking boat by years
Dollar signs, crocodile tears
It's over now and long has been
Those days are gone, won't come again
Another name crossed off the list
The real thing would kill you quick
[Chorus]
Rise!
Again, we will rise!
Rise!
Again, we will rise!
[Post-Chorus]
There's nothing for you to fight against
You're so unreal, it's evident
You'll never be one of our kind
This ain't yours, fuck you, don't try
[Bridge]
Ain't yours, fuck you, don't try
Ain't yours, fuck you, don't try
This ain't yours, so fuck you, don't try
This ain't yours, fuck you, don't try!
This was never yours, fuck you, don't try!
[Verse 3]
The bridge was burnt before you could cross
You reap the benefits of what's lost
Go home, son; hang your costume up
A goddamn insult to the rest of us
A thousand-yard stare across the South
A full belly and a lying mouth
Momma's boy plays heretic
The real thing would kill you quick, bitch
[Chorus]
Rise!
Again, we will rise!
Rise!
Again, we will rise!
[Post-Chorus]
There's nothing for you to fight against
You're so unreal it's evident
You'll never be one of our kind
This ain't yours, fuck you, don't try
[Outro]
Rise!
Well, fuck you, don't even try
Rise!
Well, fuck you, your time is nigh
Rise!
Fuck you, I've had enough
Rise!
Well, fuck you, your time is up
Rise!
Well, fuck you, don't even try
Rise!
Well, fuck you, your time is nigh!
Rise!
Fuck you, I've had enough
Rise!
Well, fuck you, your time is up
