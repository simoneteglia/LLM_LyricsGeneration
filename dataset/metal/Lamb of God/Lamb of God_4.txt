[Intro]
Woah!
[Verse 1]
So goddamn easy to write this
You make it spill on the page
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous
The laughingstock of your own fucking stage
[Pre-Chorus]
But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me
[Chorus]
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me
[Verse 2]
Just one time, you got a reason
Heard you had nothing to lose
A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation
It must be easy to lose
[Pre-Chorus]
But I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me
[Chorus]
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
You can tell the same lie a thousand times
But it never gets any more true
So, close your eyes once more
And once more believe
That they all still believe in you
[Pre-Chorus]
Just one time
[Chorus]
This is a motherfucking invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfucking invitation
Just one time
This is a motherfucking invitation
You try me
[Outro]
Just one time
You try me
Just one time
You try me
You try me
