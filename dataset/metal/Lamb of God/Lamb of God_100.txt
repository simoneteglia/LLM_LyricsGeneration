[Verse 1]
The path I set out on
Took a turn when the axis shifted
This is not the life I envisioned
What's done is done, the crime is committed
Now the beast has come home to roost
He returns with blood on his hands
Caught in the trap
Of meeting the laws of supply and reprimand
[Pre-Chorus]
My blood is boiling
[Chorus]
I can't feel my own skin
Though I can see it crawling
Can't expose all these sins
But I can see them falling
[Verse 2]
There's no escape from
building tension
The pressure valve has been refitted
A lost plot in constant revision
A rising storm that's never abated
You can't know enough till too much
The envelope is decimated
Too far gone now
To reverse my course and be subjugated
[Pre-Chorus]
And my blood keeps boiling
[Chorus]
I can't feel my own skin
Though I can see it crawling
Can't expose all these sins
But I can see them falling down
[Post-Chorus]
This is a labor of hate
Falling down
This is a labor of hate
Falling down
[Bridge]
This is how I choose to survive
The only way I know to exist
The road is hard, the cost is high
But I was built for this
But I was built for this
My labor of hate
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I can't feel my own skin
Though I can see it crawling
Can't expose all these sins
But I can see them falling down
[Post-Chorus]
This is a labor of hate
Falling down
This is a labor of hate
Falling down
