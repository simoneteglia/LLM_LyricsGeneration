[Verse 1]
When the walls fall around you
Is when you begin to find
That the depths you have found
Have become now too hard to climb
So, you reconcile your pain
In the loneliest refrain
And crawl, tied and bound
To the one thing you can't leave behind
[Pre-Chorus]
You can't leave behind
(You can't leave behind!)
You can't leave behind
[Chorus]
And start over again
This insurrection
The same reflection
Perpetual
And start over again and again
And again and again
[Post-Chorus]
This insurrection
[Verse 2]
A broken voice without a word to live by
Eyes slammed shut watch the world go by
It should have been way better than this
You can't anticipate the things that you miss
And how long till you let it go?
Master unreality, nothing to show
And in the end, top of the mountain of nowhere
First in the line dying to get back there
[Pre-Chorus]
You can't get back there
You can't get back there
[Chorus]
And start over again
This insurrection
The same reflection
Perpetual
And start over again and again
And again and again
[Post-Chorus]
This insurrection
And start over again
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
First in the line
To catch a glimpse of the shrine
The closest we ever got to divine
Irrefutable, indisputable
Infallible, impossible to deny
Impossible to deny
[Chorus]
And start over again
This insurrection
The same reflection
Perpetual
And start over again and again
And again and again
[Post-Chorus]
This insurrection
And start over again
