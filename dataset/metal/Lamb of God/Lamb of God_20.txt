[Verse 1]
The hour of reckoning draws near
Judgment Day is here and gone
Sweetly, she draws me into her arms
A liquid embrace to chase the day away
[Pre-Chorus]
Sedate, numb
Deaf and dumb
[Chorus]
Stumbling into solitude
A clouded Judgment Day is fueled
Take me under your black wings
Mark my words and remember me
[Verse 2]
So sweetly, she sucks away at my time
So sweetly, she draws me nigh
Closer and closer towards never-ending sleep
Spin the bottle, kiss only the bottle
The dark mistress of many, beholden to none
Slips a ring of needles
Around your arm
in an engagement
Eternal engagement,
never consummated
[Chorus]
Never consummated!
Take me under your black wings
Mark my words and remember me
[Bridge]
Destroyer of senses
So, take as needed for the pain
Another gray morning dawns across an ashen sky
My sweet demoness
Beckons me
Ever again and again and again and again!
[Outro]
The dark mistress of many, beholden to none
My sweet demoness
Beckons me ever again and again and again and again
Take me under your black wings
Jacked up on the taste of self-destruction
