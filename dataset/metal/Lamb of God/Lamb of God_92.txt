[Intro]
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
[Verse 1]
Betrayed electric winds that blow into the night
Relay the truth, a harbinger of hidden strife
And on the jungle's edge, I feel my anger start to rise
Awake the colder man I thought I left behind to die
[Pre-Chorus 1]
No morе peace
Inside a warring hеad
Sharp release
The shift begins to spread
So many questions but the only answer's death
Mercy bows its battered head to take a dying breath
[Chorus]
A broken vow and shattered trust
Know now this will be the death of us
A thoughtless path, the foulest lust
Know now this will be the death of us
[Post-Chorus]
(Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath)
[Verse 2]
Depart on bitter winds above the crashing waves
Returning iron will to face the coming days
And in the deepest rut I feel the pain begin to fade
A hopeless, helpless wreck reborn inside a burning flame
[Pre-Chorus 2]
No belief
When all is compromised
Silently
I sit and bide the time
Grease the hinge and turn the key
Move in the darkest night
Rouse a sleeping monster
Bring it forth into the light
[Chorus]
A broken vow and shattered trust
Know now this will be the death of us
A thoughtless path, the foulest lust
Know now this will be the death of us
[Post-Chorus]
(Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath)
[Bridge]
The death of us
The death of us
[Chorus]
A broken vow and shattered trust
Know now this will be the death of us
A thoughtless path, the foulest lust
Know now this will be the death of us
[Post-Chorus]
(Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath)
[Outro]
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
Hopeless, helpless, dying breath
