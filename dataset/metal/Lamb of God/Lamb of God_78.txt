[Verse 1]
Returning to solace
So sweet like honeysuckle on the tongue
The sound of silence blesses my ears
Enveloping like the earth
I will one day lie in
Metropolis is bad to wither the soul
Roaring concrete and steel
Washes you in blood
[Verse 2]
So, let you point and laugh
Provincial ain't so bad
Take me back down to where I belong
To rust and rivers
I do not covet any man's life
I know my place all too well
One man's paradise
Is another man's living hell
To each their own
Generations ago made this place my own
The roots are deep and strong
Carry them wherever I go
[Chorus]
Never wanted your approval
Never wanted your acceptance
Never wanted to be anything but me
Never wanted to be anywhere but here
Carry me Southeast-bound home
To speak in defense of our good name
Lay me to rest with my kin
In the ground of God's country
[Verse 3]
Lash out at any who
Would smear you with hate
Deify no one, never crawl ashamed
The past screams injustice on
A Southern night, wind whips
Manacles, chains, musket balls
A dark history never forgotten
Only misconception remains
[Bridge]
Speak in defense of our good name
The blood of kin grants absolution
I'll join them soon enough
In the ground of God's country
Speak in defense of our good name
The blood of kin grants absolution
I'll join them soon enough
In the ground of God's country
[Chorus]
Never wanted your acceptance
Never wanted your approval
Never wanted to be anything but me
Never wanted to be anywhere but right here
