[Verse 1]
I know a place under the sun
Where my memories of you will burn
You'll be too easy to forget
Erased by the light, you'll never cast a shadow
A ghost on the wind, it's like I never knew you
I burnt that bridge down to the ground
I'm on the other side
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd say it's all your fault but we know that's not true
Still, I don't care enough to make it up to you
[Chorus]
Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
You're everything I left behind
I won't reconcile, you've lost your mind
I'm leaving you behind
Bloodshot
[Verse 2]
A sad cliché of love and hate
Deserving everything we get
Not worth a moment of regret
I open my eyes and see the dream is long dead
I turned my back and quit the war in my head
I left our Eden dead and to the weeds
So tired of wasting time
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'd say there's still a chance but we know that's not true
I'm never coming back to suffer there with you
[Chorus]
Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
You're everything I left behind
I won't reconcile, you've lost your mind
I'm leaving you behind
Bloodshot
[Post-Chorus]
(Bloodshot eyes)
[Bridge]
I don't give a fuck what you have to say
I cut my losses and I walked away
I don't give a fuck about what you have to say
You don't matter at all
You're nothing to me
[Chorus]
Bloodshot eyes and wasted time
You're everything I left behind
I won't reconcile, you've lost your mind
I'm leaving you behind
Bloodshot eyes
[Outro]
I'd say it's all your fault but we know that's not true
I don't give a fuck about what you have to say
Bloodshot eyes
Still, I don't care enough to make it up to you
Bloodshot
