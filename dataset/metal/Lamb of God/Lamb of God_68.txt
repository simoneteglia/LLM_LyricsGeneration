I want some hatred on through
This pain to feel you're fading
They say, "Stop, be more gentle"
It seems I walk this hard trail alone
Come, danger, take them all
Then throw them at the walls
Lost
Why won't you let me go?
What does your father feel?
There is no point, is your papa not living now?
I'm gonna tear off the legs of the one that killed
Me, the most powerful human of all
Woe
[Guitar Solo]
I, a missing father
An empty role
Why did this immortal good child forget me
Why'd a man's own father blow these
Heartstrings away
Thrice have I called for blood
I want the undead child
Why wouldn't fate let this unborn child
Die a wooden blow
Please
Kill
Him
