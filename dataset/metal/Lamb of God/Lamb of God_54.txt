[Verse 1]
I just got the news today you were dying
Hot damn! We're already partying
But please, before you have to leave
Let me tell you a few last things:
[Refrain]
Suffer!
Unto me
Indulge!
My every need
[Verse 2]
I don't want to meet you halfway
I've always despised that fucking place
[Refrain]
Suffer!
Unto me
Indulge!
My every need
[Verse 3]
I'm not offering you my way
I'm kicking you down the fucking highway
[Chorus]
Get one thing straight from the get-go:
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill
Get one thing straight from the get-go:
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill
[Post-Chorus]
I never have and I never will
I never have and I never will
[Bridge]
Fuck your world up
Goddamn!
Your last breath
I'll take it now!
Your last breath
I'll take it now!
Your last breath
I'll rip it away!
And haunt your dreams in your final sleep!
[Interlude]
You can wish in one hand, and shit in the other
You'll see which one filled up first
Your number's come up
And it sure as hell ain't the lucky one, son
[Chorus]
Get one thing straight from the get-go:
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill
Get one thing straight from the get-go:
I truly don't give a fuck about you
I never have and I never will
Each day you breathe is more time to kill
[Post-Chorus]
I never have, I never will
Never will
I never have, I never will!
Never will!
