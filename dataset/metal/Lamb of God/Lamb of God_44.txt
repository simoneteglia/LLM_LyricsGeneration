[Verse 1]
You want to blame me
For the way you hate yourself
You think you can find
Who you are in someone else
Criticize to better your relative positioning
You've got a long way to go
[Pre-Chorus]
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
[Chorus]
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
[Verse 2]
A needless heir apparent
Paranoid despair
You take great measure
To appear like you don't care
Precision and persuasion
Must precede the proper lie
You lost it before you began
[Pre-Chorus]
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
[Chorus]
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
[Bridge]
Only yourself left to betray
(Only yourself left to betray)
[Pre-Chorus]
So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail
[Chorus]
Somewhere you finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray
Somewhere you finally lost your way
You're so set to fail
Only yourself left to betray
