[Verse 1]
A thousand heads
Cut clean across their necks
Right down the hall from me
The Reich's relentless blade
Thirsty and shining red
Still echoes of their screams
[Pre-Chorus]
This is a tarnished heirloom
Passed down through iron fists
A shameful house of doom
A legacy of collapse, built on a painful truth
[Chorus]
A thousand years of failure
A thousand years, they bled
To the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the Holy Father
They just bowed their heads
[Verse 2]
They meekly did their time
Counting the days
While harnessed to their rusty shackles
Forever occupied
Folded the crimson star
The rabbits turned to jackals
[Refrain]
Still echoes of their screams
Still echoes of their screams!
[Pre-Chorus]
This is a tarnished heirloom
Passed down through iron fists
A shameful house of doom
A legacy of collapse, built on a painful truth
[Chorus]
A thousand years of failure
A thousand years, they bled
To the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the Holy Father
They just bowed their heads
[Bridge]
Soviet hangover, Eastern Bloc
And dirty money still flows through locks
A killing ground of rebels, black marketeers
Restrained, but there's no resistance here
Southeast Asia in a Euro cellblock
Saigon's children conceal what they've got
The opium trail runs west through here
They're selling disease to erase all your fears
(Fears, fears, fears)
Still echoes of their screams
Still echoes of their screams!
[Chorus]
A thousand years of failure
A thousand years, they bled
To the bear, the blitzkrieg, and the Holy Father
They just bowed their heads
[Outro]
Still echoes of their screams
I won't bow my head
Still echoes of their screams
I won't bow my head!
