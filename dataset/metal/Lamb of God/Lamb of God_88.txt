[Verse 1]
Arrogance mounted on a poison steed
Hangman swings from a rope of conceit
Pale horse runs septic through his veins
For I am the end of all his days
The end of all his days!
[Refrain]
A dead finger pulls the trigger
To decide the final hour
[Chorus]
We are the faces of the end
We are the architects of ruin
Fathers of rebellion, disciples of the reaper
We are the apex predator
[Verse 2]
A superior man, I will bleed the butcher dry
In the underground, I live, I fight, I die
I will rust the iron heart
I will crush the death head's march
[Refrain]
A dead finger pulls the trigger
To decide the final hour
[Chorus]
We are the faces of the end
We are the architects of ruin
Fathers of rebellion, disciples of the reaper
We are the apex predator
[Bridge]
Bleed
Bleed the butcher dry
A dead finger pulls the trigger
A dead finger pulls the trigger
Under the cross
We're bound to die
In the cage
I'm ready
'Cause I am what you are too afraid to be
I am what you are too afraid to...
I am what you are too afraid to be
[Chorus]
We are the faces of the end
We are the architects of ruin
Fathers of rebellion, disciples of the reaper
We are the apex predator
[Outro]
We are!
I live, I fight, I die
We are!
I live, I fight, I die
We are!
I live, I fight, I die
We are!
The apex predator
