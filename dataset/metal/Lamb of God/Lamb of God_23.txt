[Verse 1]
Chopping lines in international sand
Feeding blood junkie habits
of the elephant man
Quench his thirst with black water rising
Executive outcomes on a burning horizon
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, motherfucker, let's take a ride
We're rolling Route Irish
Someone has got to die
Trick or treat, it's
IEDs
So, roll the dice as we leave
,
'Cause it's eight miles of pure luck
With more bang for Sam's buck
[Chorus]
Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed
Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed
[Verse 2]
Privatize to conceal all the lies
Big business is booming like it's the Fourth of July
No need for all the formalities
Jump the kangaroo courts and plant the lynching trees
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, motherfucker, let's take a ride
Running red lights in a
green zone
Someone has got to die
Hidden
Aegis
, nothing here to see
So, load the dice for me, please
And let's snort the bottom line
Crude cashed into refined
[Chorus]
Guaran-fucking-teed
Just sign the deed
Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed
[Bridge]
(Someone has got to die)
Ours is not to reason why
Ours is but to do if the pay rate's right
Black liquid assets, fuck the Mujahideen
Paint their picket fences red with the American dream
Lay the heavy hammer down, get the job done right
Jacked up and clocked in into a firefight
Covert reactions, and you never saw me
A glass parking lot in the American dream, yeah
[Breakdown]
They all die
Fucking murder
[Chorus]
Guaran-fucking-teed
Someone will bleed
Guaran-fucking-teed
[Outro]
Lay the heavy hammer down, get the job done right
Jacked up and clocked in into a firefight
Covert reactions, and you never saw me
A glass parking lot in the American dream
