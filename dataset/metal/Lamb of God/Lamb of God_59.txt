[Verse 1]
At a loss for something different to say
I've said everything, we've said it all before
[Refrain]
An extra nail for your coffin
[Verse 2]
I'm going to ride that horse we've beaten to death
And deliver its stinking carcass to your doorstep
A gift from all the dead children
That are the progeny of your ballistic union
[Chorus]
Borrowing from Peter to rape Paul
No news is good news
But I've got some news for you
Fetch me a rope, lynch mob of one
[Refrain]
An extra nail for your coffin
[Verse 3]
Certain blood has been shed for uncertain reasons
You will never quiet this storm
A cold wind to chill your bones
I bring the hammer down
[Chorus]
Borrowing from Peter to rape Paul
No news is good news
But I've got some news for you
Fetch me a rope, lynch mob of one
[Guitar Solo]
