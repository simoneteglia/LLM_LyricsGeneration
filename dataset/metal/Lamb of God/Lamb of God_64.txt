[Verse 1]
Justify
A means to an ending, only just beginning
To legitimize
The conflict that's rendering, the interaction so useless
Futility defined
Watching you wait for the stars to align
So clueless, so simple it should be a crime
And I can't bring myself to save you this time
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me in your sights, possessed by the spite
Woeful irrelevance
So quick to ignite, impulse to indict
Defense for incompetence
[Chorus]
For what it's worth
It was over before it began
Blind in your search
No one to guide your hand
For what it's worth
You crossed a line in the sand
Cut off, locked out
As it fell right through your hands
[Verse 2]
Victimize
Cast off, forgotten daughter, play the martyr
So they sympathize
With your condition and your position
It's strategic how your misfortune became so fortunate
Oh, it must be torture keeping up with it
Consider me disengaged
And find a better character for your stage
[Pre-Chorus]
Only ever more, still keeping the score
Is there enough for you?
Keep one thing for sure, stay pure saboteur
It's simply what you do
[Chorus]
For what it's worth
It was over before it began
Blind in your search
No one to guide your hand
For what it's worth
You crossed a line in the sand
Cut off, locked out
As it fell right through your hands
[Bridge]
Erase this, replace this
With something to have hope in
Sever all ties that bind
The circle will be broken
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me in your sights, possessed by the spite
Woeful irrelevance
So quick to ignite, impulse to indict
Defense for incompetence
[Chorus]
For what it's worth
It was over before it began
Blind in your search
No one to guide your hand
For what it's worth
You crossed a line in the sand
Cut off, locked out
As it fell right through your hands
