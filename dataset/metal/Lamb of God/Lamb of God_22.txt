[Intro]
Our father, thy will be done
I have denied this life, its worth
I will not be the victim
[Verse 1]
Sickness to you, my master
Here's to getting worse
Hope it kills you faster
Show me how it hurts
To rot from the inside out
This vigil burns until the day
Our fires overtake you
Our father, we forsake you
[Bridge]
Blessed be his name
Nothing now the same
[Verse 2]
Ask me why I hate
Why I've prayed to see
The nation that I loved disintegrate
And gladly give my life
That revolution regenerates
[Chorus]
In honor of the strife
Of those who've died
In generations before
For your bloodstained glory
I reject you; I deny you
I defy you to continue
[Bridge]
I defy you to continue
[Chorus]
In honor of the strife
Of those who've died
In generations before
For your bloodstained glory
I reject you; I deny you
I defy you to continue
[Outro]
Smite the shepherd
And the sheep will be scattered
