The sore on the edge of your mouth
It mirrors the ones on your arm of black tar
You've known the ripping
And I've seen you pissing your condition into the dirt
I know you don't want to live in the dirt
You want to, you know nothing but dirt
You know you can't beat weakness
Kill the flux, stretched to breaking
An obscene canvas on a stretcher of parasitism
You piece of shit, I won't say your name
But I will say this: Fuck off and die
(Sooner, the better...)
You've shot out your eyes
But I'm seeing that you cannot feel anything of worth
Know that you've pissed life away
Lost in your narcotic dreams
Heart pumping futile shit through your veins
Why does it bother?
I want to punch in your sunken face
And see your dusty blood
Smear through the air in a polluted crimson arc
Splattering in a useless pattern on the concrete
Moribund
