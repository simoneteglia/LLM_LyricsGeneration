[Verse 1: Randy Blythe]
Monsters have run inside of me
From my birth on sour ground
Demons swimming my bloodstream
Festering without a sound
[Pre-Chorus: Randy Blythe]
Dead inside
You are the bull
Dead inside
They lulled to sleep
Dead inside
Struck colorblind
Can't see red through the green
[Chorus: Randy Blythe]
A legacy, a poisoned dream
Fortunes made on misery
A burning river, a black sea
Bloody skies and dying memories
This poisoned dream
[Verse 2: Randy Blythe]
Toxic temple and polluted bliss
Residuals for evil men
I never had a choice in this
Sacrificed for their profit
[Pre-Chorus: Randy Blythe]
Dead inside
Will you pray?
Dead inside
Or will you fight?
Dead inside
There's no one for us
But us in this toxic life
[Chorus: Randy Blythe]
A legacy, a poisoned dream
Fortunes made on misery
A burning river, a black sea
Bloody skies and dying memories
This poisoned dream
[Post-Chorus: Randy Blythe]
Rage inside this poisoned dream

Because you're not a human being, just a fine to be paid
Just the cost of doing business in their cancerous trade
More collateral damage to be swept away
A footnote in the story of their moral decay
Know you'll never find compassion in their empty souls
From their ravenous eyes to their corrupted bones
Life means nothing to them as our history shows
Endless chemical warfare waged on our homes
[Pre-Chorus: Randy Blythe,
Jamey Jasta

Dead inside
You are the bull
Dead inside
Awake from sleep
Dead inside
Open your eyes
Gouge the heart of their greed
[Chorus: Randy Blythe
with Jamey Jasta
]
A legacy, a poisoned dream
Fortunes made on
misery
A burning river,
a black sea
Bloody skies and dying memories
This poisoned dream
[Outro: Randy Blythe]
We're at war, war, war
In this poisoned dream
