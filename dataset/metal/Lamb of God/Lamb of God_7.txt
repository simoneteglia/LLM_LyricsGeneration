[Verse 1]
There was Christ in the metal shell
There was blood on the pavement
The camera will make you God
That's how Jack became sainted
[Pre-Chorus]
If you die when there's no one watching
And your ratings drop, and you're forgotten
If they kill you on the TV
You're a martyr and a Lamb of God
[Interlude]
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change
the world
[Verse 2]
There was Lennon in the happy gun
There were words on the pavement
We were looking for the Lamb of God
We were looking for Mark David
[Pre-Chorus]
If you die when there's no one watching
And your ratings drop, and you're forgotten
If they kill you on the TV
You're a martyr and a Lamb of God
[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change the world
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change the world
Nothing's gonna change the world
[Bridge]
Took three days for him to die
The born again could buy the serial rights
Lamb of God, have mercy on us
Lamb of God, will you grant us?
[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change the world
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change the world
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change the world
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change the world
Nothing's gonna change
the world
[Outro]
If you die when there's no one watching
And your ratings drop, and you're forgotten
If they kill you on the TV
You're a martyr and a Lamb of God
Nothing's gonna change the world
