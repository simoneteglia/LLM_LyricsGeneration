[Verse 1]
Here we go again
The world is coming to an end
Engage the fear machine
And collect the dividends
That's it, you filthy monkeys
Keep your eyes on the bright and shiny
Just for you, a brand-new
And improved catastrophe
[Pre-Chorus]
Purebred Pavlov
Prime-time apocalypse
Hit the panic button
And reap the bloody benefits
[Chorus]
Paranoia writes the checks
Strung out like a marionette
A hole in the sky, a hole in your head
It's business as usual
We're bringing you disaster in high-def
[Verse 2]
Once again, my friends:
The world is coming to an end
No empty threat this time
So let the witch hunts begin
The sky is falling, seal the borders
Heighten the anxiety
A steady diet of hysteria
Shapes history
[Pre-Chorus]
Purebred Pavlov
Prime-time apocalypse
Hit the panic button
And reap the bloody benefits
[Chorus]
Paranoia writes the checks
Strung out like a marionette
A hole in the sky, a hole in your head
It's business as usual
We're bringing you disaster in high-def
[Bridge]
Stream the latest threat
From the limelight economists
Fabricated peril
From contagion to communists
Fear delivered to your door
By racketeers and strategists
Another advertisement war
Sold by the media terrorists
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Paranoia writes the checks
Strung out like a marionette
A hole in the sky, a hole in your head
It's business as usual
We're bringing you disaster in high-def
