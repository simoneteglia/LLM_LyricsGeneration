[Verse 1]
As I walk through the sodden killing fields
A million souls interred beneath my heals
The darkest sights... no, they can't be unseen
Burn the eyes, crush the heart, and scar the psyche
[Chorus]
This black reward
This crimson burden
I am the morbid witness
A scholar of aberrance
[Post-Chorus]
The one who never forgets
I can never forget
The one who...
[Verse 2]
Exhume the graves and grind the bones to dust
Salt the earth and satisfy the lust
The archaeology of genocide
Reconstructed, cataloged, and canonized
[Chorus]
This grim vocation
These fearsome wages
I am the nightmare seeker
A student of violent teachers
[Post-Chorus]
The one who never forgets
I can never forget
[Bridge]
The ghost of Zyklon hangs in the air... extermination
Can you smell the sarin on the wind?
War is coming, war is coming to take us again
War is coming, war is coming to take us again
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
This black reward
This crimson burden
I am the morbid witness
A scholar of aberrance
[Post-Chorus]
The one who never forgets
I can never forget
[Outro]
War is coming (Never forget!)
War is coming to take us again
War is coming (Never forget!)
War is coming to take us again
War is coming (Never forget!)
War is coming to take us again
War is coming (Never forget!)
War is coming to take us again
