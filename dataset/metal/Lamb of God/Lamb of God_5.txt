[Intro]
Pray...
Pray...
Pray...
Pray...
[Verse 1]
Pray for blood
Pray for the cleansing
Pray for the flood
Pray for the end of this nightmare
This lie of a life came
As quickly as it can dissolve
[Pre-Chorus]
We seek only reprieve
And welcome the darkness
The myth of a meaning
So lost and forgotten! (Forgotten...)
[Chorus]
Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell
[Verse 2]
Pray for solace
Pray for resolve
Pray for a savior
Pray for deliverance
Some kind of purpose
A glimpse of a light in this void of existence
[Pre-Chorus]
Now witness the end of an age
Hope dies in hands of believers
Who seek the truth in the liar's eyes!
[Chorus]
Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell
[Bridge]
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Take hold of my hand
For you are no longer alone
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
Walk with me in hell
You're never alone
You're never alone
You're never alone
You're never alone
You're never alone
Walk with me in hell
