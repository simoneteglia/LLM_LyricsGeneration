[Verse 1]
Sermon sung me slow to sleep
Faster if I had a choice
With every breath, another death
Still so in love with your own voice
Idle threats to hide regrets
Excuses serve to bide the time
Cover tracks, double back
We summon silence so divine
[Refrain]
Greeted with a thundering
Absence of applause
[Chorus]
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak my name
[Verse 2]
Jesus complex, gag reflex
Trigger-happy redundancy
No thrill, no chase, no saving grace
Hypnotic in monotony
Loaded with a salt rock shot
You say you're everything you're not
What might have been is all you've got
From here and now, you're dead to me
[Refrain]
Greeted with a thundering
Absence of applause
[Chorus]
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak my name
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak my name
[Bridge]
Nothing will ever erase
Or undo your disgrace
A lonely self-embrace
They've long forgotten you
Still cling to what it was
A lost and hopeless cause
Forever mourning your loss
They've long forgotten you
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
Murdered slowly
In minute increments of time
Pissing up a rope
Another moment passes by
[Chorus]
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak my name
Choke on your own words
Lies are venom in your veins
Burn from the inside
And never speak
And never speak my name
