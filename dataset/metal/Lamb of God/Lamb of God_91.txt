[Intro]
Then you wake
[Verse 1]
Another body bag, pathetic
Picture frame obituary faded in the attic
A shadow of someone you used to be
You've seen so many in these flames
And swore that you'd never become the clich√©
A long-forgotten memory
[Pre-Chorus]
And when you wake
[Chorus]
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned, forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
[Verse 2]
Another day, a little dirt for the grave
Is it worth everything that you gave?
What a beautiful way to waste away
Consumed by dependency
A lesson in despondency
A long-forgotten memory
[Pre-Chorus]
And when youwake
[Chorus]
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned, forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
[Bridge]
And then you wake
And then you wake
How quickly the master
Turns into the slave
Slowly succumbing more
Every dying day
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Everything you ever wanted
Everything you never had
Everything learned forgotten and dead
Everything turns to nothing
[Outro]
Everything turns to nothing
Everything turns to nothing
