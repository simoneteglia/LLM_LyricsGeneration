[Verse 1]
There's nothing new under the gun
Cognitive dissonance
Wallow in sardonic fear
While your will breaks like glass
[Pre-Chorus]
Throw on the blinders, ignore the signs
Sink ever deeper, swallow the lie
[Chorus]
How far did you think that you could run?
You crossed the last meridian
As life passes you by
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Outside the fishbowl looking in
Clarity to bear witness
Oblivious and obstinate
And you're a fucking mess
[Pre-Chorus]
Seal all the exits, tie your own hands
Burn all the bridges, head in the sand
[Chorus]
How far did you think that you could run?
You crossed the last meridian
And it's all, it's all coming down now
As the clock ticks on, your life is passing by
[Post-Chorus]
Your life is passing by
Your life is passing by
[Bridge]
Awaken
Awaken
Awaken
Singing the same, tired, old song
Predictable and somnambulant
Suffering from terminal uniqueness
When will you awaken?
Awaken?
Awaken?
[Chorus]
How far did you think that you could run?
You crossed the last meridian
And it's all, it's all coming down now
As the clock ticks on, your life is passing by
[Post-Chorus]
Your life is passing by
Your life is passing by
