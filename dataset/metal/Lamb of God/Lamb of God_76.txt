[Intro: Randy Blythe]
There’s no justice, only revenge
And no love left in you, only pain
[Verse 1: Randy Blythe]
Bleeding in your echo chamber
A crimson hall of dirty mirrors
Hair-trigger fingertips illuminate your every conflict, oh
All eyes on you, but nothing’s clearer
[Verse 2: Randy Blythe]
Weaponizing, suffering, the licks you never had
Trauma echoes, stolen from the shoulders of the past
Self-inflicted agonies to build a blind defense
The tears of titans currency in your incompetence
[Chorus: Jake Duzsik]
No justice, only revenge
No love left, only the pain
No justice, only revenge
No love left, only the pain
[Verse 3: Randy Blythe]
Whines of opportunity to stack the fiction high
Demonize all scrutiny to sell the truth a lie
Spitting in a giant’s face to set your past ablaze
Rejecting your inheritance to wear another’s face
[Bridge: Randy Blythe]
Birthrights
Compromised
Drop the curtain on your past
The self you so despise
[Chorus: Jake Duzsik]
No justice, only revenge
No love left, only the pain
No justice, only revenge
No love left, only the pain
[Outro: Jake Duzsik &
Randy Blythe
]
Nothing left
Nothing
Nothing left
Nothing
Birthrights
(Nothing left)
Weaponized
(Nothing)
No justice, nothing left
There's no way, yeah
