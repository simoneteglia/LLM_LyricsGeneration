[Verse 1]
All of this comes crashing down
Cornerstone's gone
Sleepless, hopeless
No end in sight
[Refrain]
Inkwell has run dry
Fill it with blood of the scribe
[Bridge]
Rest comes easy to the guiltless
The vampire laments as he prays for the sun
[Verse 2]
Doom, despair, tragedy
Are the tools of the trade
[Chorus]
Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip-mine the vein, lay to waste
[Verse 3]
Frayed at the edge, flatlined
The anvil cracks, the hammer
Relentlessly comes down
A new pariah is born
[Chorus]
Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip-mine the vein, lay to waste
[Bridge]
Chastisement lays you down to sleep
Tucks you in with bloody kisses
Gifts of nightmares
Bittersweet
[Verse 4]
Type A negative shuts me down
Catchphrase will be death of me
Is this not what you came to see?
What, are you not entertained?
[Outro]
Climb the walls till nails bleed
Rip the hair, tear the seams
Break the glass, head in hands
Bell tolls endlessly, no end in sight
