[Intro]
Death lies eternal
A heathen rapture consumes the light
Impaled on its axis
The world around me lays down to die
[Verse 1]
Immaculate contraception
The masses bleeding opiates
Apocalyptic conception
Planted in seething reprobates
[Verse 2]
Unremitting desolation
There is no reprieve
The end goes unfound
The angel's eyes are gouged with tragedy
The end goes unfound
The fallen host endures mortality
The end goes...
[Pre-Chorus]
A black pasture devoid of the shepherd
Where you choose to dwell
[Chorus]
Venomous concepts
Catalyst of damnation
Unease filtered through chemical haze
You're so far gone
Sole purveyor of your own unrest
Go cry on the shoulder of your god
You're so far gone
The catalyst of damnation
[Verse 3]
A lone voice in the void
There is no reprieve
The end goes unfound
No answer will be found to the endless why
The end goes unfound
Deeds done in darkness will always come to light
The end goes...
[Pre-Chorus]
A black pasture devoid of the shepherd
Where you choose to dwell
[Chorus]
Venomous concepts
Catalyst of damnation
Unease filtered through chemical haze
You're so far gone
Sole purveyor of your own unrest
Go cry on the shoulder of your god
You're so far gone
The catalyst of damnation
[Bridge]
The Nephilim walk the earth again
Primordial chaos resurrected
The divine narcotic, strung-out seraphim
The catalyst, catalyst of damnation
[Verse 4]
In the code of life, a spiral death
A rattle from within
The helix dies, no answers lie
In a world without end
[Chorus]
Venomous concepts
Catalyst of damnation
Unease filtered through chemical haze
You're so far gone
Sole purveyor of your own unrest
Go cry on the shoulder of your god
You're so far gone
The catalyst of damnation
Of damnation
You're so far gone
Sole purveyor of your own unrest
Go cry on the shoulder of your god
You're so far gone
The catalyst of damnation
