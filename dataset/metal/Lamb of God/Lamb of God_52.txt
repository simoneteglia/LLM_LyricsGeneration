[Verse 1]
Spoken sideways and indirect
Without a single word left unchecked
And by your own admission
No one is ever above suspicion
Defenses never to be let down
The lies readily abound
Gaping jaw tightly wound
[Chorus]
In your desolation
Still searching for nowhere
Desolation
You're living in nowhere
[Verse 2]
Smoking gun, cause and effect
Paradise lost, a beautiful wreck
And to you, I solemnly swear
All I ever wanted was away from here
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time
I only took what was rightfully mine
Seek and you shall find
[Chorus]
In your desolation
Still searching for nowhere
Desolation
You're living in nowhere
[Bridge]
The dying man might take you with him
Until then, I'll split the difference
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time!
I'm gonna take what is rightfully mine!
Desolation
Desolation!
[Chorus]
In your desolation
Still searching for nowhere
Desolation
You're living in nowhere
[Outro]
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time!
The dying man might take you with him
I swear to you I'll split the difference
All that for nothing
What a fucking waste of time!
Desolation
