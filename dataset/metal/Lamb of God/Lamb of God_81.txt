[Verse 1]
A shallow little jackal of a man
Posing as a hawk, conniving opportunist
Lease the blade, the gun, the bomb
In the name of justice
A violent panacea for what ails the nation
In advancement for the pig
You'll not wrest the truth from my hands
Eyes never closed, clarity!
Clamped down in a grip so tight
On ordinary horror!
Peering through a curtain of blood!
[Verse 2]
Retribution or vengeance
It matters not which as long
As the pig stays on top of the ladder
Of bone his father has built
Ashes to ashes to the dust
Eaten, spiced with ambivalence!
The nation swallows it all whole
Weakened by their collective neck in the noose
[Bridge 1]
Commerce brings war
Jihad has come to both sides
Eye for an eye, fire for fire
Raining death as the towers crumble
This will never end
Left without a choice
By the fiscal elite
War is set in motion by higher powers
A pissing contest for the unknown
Left bankrupt, we all die inside
As a couple jumps hand in hand to their death
[Bridge 2]
Wrapped in swaddling lies and laid in a dumpster
Spoon-fed shit doesn't even turn their stomachs
Gaping mouths yawn for more abuse
Someone needs to tip the nest
The pig ascends as I sink deeper
Seething, waiting for my death
[Outro]
The pig ascends
As I sink deeper
Seething, misanthropic
Waiting for my death
