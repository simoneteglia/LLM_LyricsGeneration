[Verse 1]
The fiends have gagged
A generation of pacified fools
Bound by our greed
A nation enslaved as corporate tools
Arise and raze the legacy of their lies
To realize that this, in itself, is an ascension
Towards the day we revolt
[Chorus]
As the seeds you've cast away take hold
War will be born
Rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
We'll dance as the palaces burn
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
A shotgun blast into the face of deceit
You'll gain your just reward
We'll not rest until the purge is complete
You will reap what you've sown
[Bridge]
My redemption lies in your demise
[Verse 3]
In such a world as this
Does one dare to think for himself?
The paradox of power and peace
Will destroy itself
To know the truth and live in fear of no man
To realize that this, in itself, is an ascension
Towards the day we revolt
[Chorus]
As the seeds you've cast away take hold
War will be born
Rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
We'll dance as the palaces burn
My redemption
Redemption lies in your demise
Rejoice, the age of the fall has begun
We'll dance as the palaces burn
