[Verse 1]
Down, chemical sacrament
Blasphemous prayer
Deliver me from this
So serene apocalypse
[Pre-Chorus]
Just make me fucking numb
Deaf, blind, and fucking dumb
Return to sacred sleep!
[Chorus]
This could be my requiem
And I'll feel no pain
This could be my requiem
But don't bury me too deep!
[Verse 2]
Drain infected brine
Sickened cesspool shell of mine
Strap up the hands of time
And push the soul into the vein
[Pre-Chorus]
Just make me fucking numb
Deaf, blind, and fucking dumb
Return to sacred sleep!
[Chorus]
This could be my requiem
And I'll feel no pain
This could be my requiem
But don't bury me too deep!
[Interlude: Jim Jones "Death Tape" Sample]
"And we had better not have
Any of our children left when it's over
'Cause they'll parachute in here on us [...]
Because we are not committing suicide
It's a revolutionary act [...]
...Calm, let's get calm [...]
We had nothing we could do, we can't
We can't separate ourselves from our own people [...]
It's not to be feared, it is not to be feared
It's a friend, it's a friend [...]
Let's be done with the agony of it
It's far, far harder to have to watch you
Every day die slowly
And from the time you were a child
To the time you get gray, you're dying [...]
Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother
Please, mother, please, lease, please, don't...
Lay down your life with your child, but don't do this [...]
And we had better not have any of our children left when it's over [...]
Lay down your life with your child [...]
Oh, God almighty, God almighty..."
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Sink, suffer, self-destruct
Rise stronger, reconstruct
Sink, suffer, self-destruct
Rise stronger, reconstruct
[Outro]
Dispose
Discard
Deny
And I will feel no pain
