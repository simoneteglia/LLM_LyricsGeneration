[Verse 1]
This is a mean and cold town
I hate this fucking place
Watch the rats as they all drown
Dying slowly day by day
Decrepit and falling down
Cesspool of human waste
Swallow profits in deep
Now, in death, you'll finally know the taste
[Chorus]
There are no souls left here to save
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced
[Verse 2]
You fucking hypocrite
But hooks in lips, they do not lie
Compassion served not on your plate
How many of them have you watched die?
I can't sing you a happy song
I can't write you a sing-along
The only catchy hook I've got
Is the one in my bleeding gut
[Pre-Chorus]
Burn it down
Burn it down
[Chorus]
There are no souls left here to save
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced
[Bridge]
Dead stares, dead eyes
Choked hopes and vacant minds
Blank words, blank lives
The end result of endless lies
[Verse 3]
There's no angels here
To get lost in the first place
Jackhammer a fault line
Pray for earthquakes
Mulholland's on fire
And my cig started it
'92 should have burnt this fucker down
We're here to finish it!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
I'm not impressed by much here
Much less what you have to say
Don't give a fuck who you know
I just want to leave this hellhole!
Know that you mean nothing to me
Nor the lies that slip from your teeth
Won't piss on you if you're on fire
One more self-important liar
[Pre-Chorus]
Burn it down
Burn it down!
[Chorus]
There are no souls left here to save
Forgotten, lost angels, long disgraced
[Outro]
Burn it
(Burn it, burn it)
Burn it
(Burn it, burn it)
Burn it
(Burn it, burn it)
Burn it down!
