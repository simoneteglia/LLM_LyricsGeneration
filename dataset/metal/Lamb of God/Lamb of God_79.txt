Hair!
Metal!
Where are the little people
Tickle your nippon
Christopher pulses you
What?
Take your present, so like it
We live in a burger, a burger, burgerâ€¦
You're going to prison with me
Water
Cock
Beckham answer
Take my larder
Howl!
Chris
Owl!
Whore!
Wow!
We crap on tadpoles
Knock out our dads
Grab our balls tightly
I am Walter, you know me from...
I played you at poker
Until you died
I am your daddy
It's true he put your pickle inside! (Inside)
Where's that horse? I've farted
Roger heard it
Where'd I put that mat
By the rocket dude, open your eyes
William!!! (William)
What?
Who does your baby love?
Where?
This jedi's feeling you
Tear
I got a bathing suit
Why?
It cooks a nippon like you
We've hoped you've enjoyed your flight
