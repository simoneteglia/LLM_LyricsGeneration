[Verse 1: Randy Blythe &
Greg Puciato
]
The soul of the nation slowly withers
(In the howl of the empty wind)
As the spring lays crushed beneath the hammer
(The invisible flame)
My vision sears the crowded square
(As the mouth of injustice grins)
This routed place
(Fire runs through my veins)
I choose to expire!
[Verse 2: Randy Blythe &
Greg Puciato
]
(As the steel in my nerve sets in)
You're all on the brink of compromise
(I carry the cries)
Mass concessions in defeated eyes
(In my end, a new world begins)
A terrible kindness to break the thrall
(It's not me who dies)
I strike the match and let it fall!
[Chorus: Randy Blythe]
Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno, I am legion
Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno, I am legion
[Bridge: Randy Blythe]
I am, I am
I am, I am the inferno!
I am, I am
I am, I am legion!
Some run screaming
Some sit silently
An agonizing gift
Of charred humanity
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Randy Blythe]
My footsteps, they will echo through eternity
A seismic scorching outcry of indignity
I write my blackened name, carved into the wind
I fill your hearts with rage, I leave you ash and legend
[Verse 3: Randy Blythe &
Greg Puciato
]
(Fire runs through my veins
Fire runs through my veins)
A terrible kindness to break the thrall
(Fire runs through my veins)
I strike the match; fire runs through my...!
[Chorus: Randy Blythe]
Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno, I am legion
Oppression, injustice, self-immolation
I am the inferno, I am legion
[Outro: Randy Blythe]
Ash and legend
I am legion
I am the inferno
I am legion
