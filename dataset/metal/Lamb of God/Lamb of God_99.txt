I'm a monster so don't walk my way
Don't trust my smile, my teeth are like knives
I'll drag you down and suck you dry
Don't laugh at my jokes
The punchline is murder
Don't enjoy my touch
Every caress hides a chokehold
I'm only happy when I've ruined everything I see
Believe everything you've ever heard about me
Suck it up
If you see me coming, don't stop
Just turn and walk the other way
I will not lie about what I have done
I will not lie about what I will do to you
The sweat of my exertion is pure poison
I'm hell
