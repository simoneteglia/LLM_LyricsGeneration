[Verse 1: Randy Blythe]
Gather the bones and lay them in the sun
In patterns that capture the eye
No one could know, display for everyone
The holes in our souls we despise
Timber and stone, monumental
Remnants frozen in time
Carried alone the burden, knowing
It was all we could do to survive
Remnants frozen in time
[Chorus: Randy Blythe]
Only embers remain
Refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain
Black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain
[Verse 2: Randy Blythe]
Scatter the dust, what we once held
In hand seems was never at all
Gone in a gust, not ours to understand
An agony perpetual
Holding my breath and close my eyes
For a second, I can see you again
Motionless, like that day
We lost who we both should have been
I can see you again
[Chorus: Randy Blythe]
Only embers remain
Refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain
Black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers
[Outro: Chino Moreno &
Randy Blythe
]
I've been staring at her lying still for so long
She's so still, she's so still!
Waiting for this endless night to color into dawn
It's never ending, it's never ending!
But it's never lifting, it's always shifting
No one can breathe
It holds me under, and this drags down you
It drags you down, it drags you down!
This breaks what was made one into two
