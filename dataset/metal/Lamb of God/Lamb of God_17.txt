[Verse 1]
Seize the darkened day
There's only hell to pay
And no one left to see
This prodigal return
Sweet apathy's black toll
You'll mourn the traded soul
I'll dig a deeper hole
[Pre-Chorus]
Sanctity, a breath away!
Just a breath away!
[Chorus]
Blacken the cursed sun
You're not the only one
To have sunk so far and low
There is no tomorrow
[Verse 2]
A tragedy on display
A sickness for all to see
I will kill this part of myself
That I hate and that I see in you
It was always mine anyway
There's some things you can't take away
I choose not to feel a thing
[Pre-Chorus]
Sanctity, a breath away!
Just a breath away!
Away! Just a breath away!
[Chorus]
Blacken the cursed sun
You're not the only one
To have sunk so far and low
There is no tomorrow
Blacken the cursed sun
Blacken what's yet to be done
Blacken because now you know
There is no tomorrow
[Post-Chorus]
You're just a breath away
You're just a breath away!
[Bridge]
Better to die quick
Fighting on your feet
Than to live forever
Begging on your knees
Begging on your, begging on your
Begging on your knees!
No!
[Outro]
Can we still be saved?
Hell, no!
Does your god hold a place for us?
Hell, no!
Is there time to repent?
Hell, no!
Will we rise from the dead?
Hell, no!
Can these sins even be forgiven?
Hell, no!
Is there still hope for us?
Hell, no!
Were we ever even alive?
Hell, no!
Is any of this even real?!
Hell, no!
Hell, no!
