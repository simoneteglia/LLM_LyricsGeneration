[Verse 1]
You suffer from a manufactured sickness and envy by design
Pre-calculated status and patterns of desire
Accumulation and adoration, built to feed your ostentation
Perpetually unsatisfied, but you never question why
[Pre-Chorus]
So hang it on the wall of your golden cage
Tell yourself that it means something
[Chorus]
Empty actions to fill the time
Commercial gods keep you in line
Industry and empire thrive
While you're dying for always more
[Verse 2]
Your endless hunger automated, industry defined
A systematic impulse, parametric lines
Subjugation and degradation, the blueprint to your annihilation
Your assets personified, a product of the times
[Pre-Chorus 2]
So hang a mirror on the wall of your golden cage
Tell yourself that you mean something
[Chorus]
Empty actions to fill the time
Commercial gods keep you in line
Industry and empire thrive
While you're dying for always more
[Bridge]
So you can't take it with you but you don't use it now
A shallow life to crush you, drive you into the ground
So scared to lose the nothings you acquire
Everything must fall, bones on a pyre
[Refrain]
(So scared to lose it all)
(So scared to lose it all)
(So scared to lose it all)
Always more
Always more
More and more and more
[Chorus]
Empty actions to fill the time
Commercial gods keep you in line
Industry and empire thrive
While you're dying for always more
[Outro]
Always more
