[Verse 1]
Blank stares of broken men
So withered from the poisons
They can't remember when
There were once honest reasons
It's all a lie
It died a hundred thousand miles ago
[Refrain]
Pretending I'm still here
[Chorus]
Justify
What I've become
Sanctify
What I've become
[Verse 2]
Amazing disgrace... How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Better lost if this is found
Best blinded, never to see
The race to save face
Nothing now is what we meant it to be
[Refrain]
Pretending I'm still here
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line
To be ground
By the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal
[Chorus]
Justify
What I've become
Sanctify
What I've become
[Bridge]
Suffered consequence
It's been so long since
Any piece of this
Made any kind of sense
You anoint the king
I'll burn everything
Down to ashes
You giveth, I taketh away
You giveth, I taketh away!
[Outro]
It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line
To be ground
By the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal
