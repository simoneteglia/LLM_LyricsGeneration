[Intro]
The sins of deliverance
[Verse 1]
The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope
[Chorus]
It's when murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one-gun salute for the new Independence Day
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your sacrifice
[Bridge]
The sins of deliverance
"So let the wicked perish
In the presence of God"
For your sacrifice
[Verse 2]
The sins of the father
Atoned by the son
Confessions of commitments broken
A nail driven for every one
[Chorus]
It's when murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one-gun salute for the new Independence Day
They'll hallow your name
They'll hallow your name for your sacrifice
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
You are the cause, I am the effect
Created in hatred, a noose for your neck
[Verse 3]
The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope
[Outro]
They'll hallow your name
For your sacrifice
They'll hallow your name
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
They'll hallow your name
