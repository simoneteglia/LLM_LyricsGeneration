[Intro]
By the darkest river
Beneath the leafless trees
I think I'm drowning
This dream is killing me
(
Wake up, wake up, wake up
)
In the coldest winter
Between the fading lights
I feel I'm falling into a frozen sky
(
Wake up, wake up, wake up
)
Past the blackest heaven
Above the dying stars
I watch me breaking into a million shards
(
Wake up, wake up, wake up
)
But through the hardest hour
Below the cruelest sign
I know I'm waking up from this wretched lie
(
Wake up, wake up
)
Wake up
[Verse 1]
A depression fed by overload
False perceptions, the weight of the world
A universe in the palm of your hand
The artifice of endless strands
[Pre-Chorus]
Distraction flows down an obsessive stream
Rejection grows into oppressive screams
[Chorus]
The hardest hour, the cruelest sign
I'm waking up from this wretched lie
I fight it the same, don't waste this day
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Memento mori
[Verse 2]
The regression of advancing modes
And imperial corrosive nodes
A prime directive to disconnect
Reclaim yourself and resurrect
[Pre-Chorus]
Distraction flows down an obsessive stream
Rejection grows into oppressive screams
[Chorus]
The hardest hour, the cruelest sign
I'm waking up from this wretched lie
I fight it the same, don't waste this day
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Memento mori
[Bridge]
There's too many choices
And I hear their relentless voices
But you've gotta run them out
Return to now and shut it down
Shut it down
A depression fed by overload
False perceptions, the weight of the world
Because there's too many choices
Gotta kill their relentless voices
(
Wake up, wake up
)
I know I'm waking up from this wretched lie
[Chorus]
The hardest hour, the cruelest sign
I'm waking up from this wretched lie
I fight it the same, don't waste this day
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Memento mori
Memento mori
