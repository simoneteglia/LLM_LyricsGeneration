[Intro: Sample]
"We killed a lot of innocent civilians
To us, every civilian in Baghdad was a terrorist
'These fedayeen are now in civilian clothes'
That makes everybody free game
But if they came within our perimeter, we lit 'em up
And when we would pull the body out
And we would search the car
We would find nothing
This took place time and time again
'No harm, no foul
That's okay; don't worry about it'
Because this is a new type of war
This is an eradication"

[Outro: Sample]
"I honestly feel
That we're committing genocide over here
I don't believe in killing civilians
And I'm not gonna kill civilians
For the United States Marine Corps"
