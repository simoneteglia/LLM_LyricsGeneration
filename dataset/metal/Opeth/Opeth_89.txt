[Verse 1]
A child of autumn was born
Into a world of deceit and death
And a land of ice
A break of bonds would take her away
And install a sense of loss and eternal sorrow
[Chorus]
Ah...
[Verse 2]
She walks across the country
She holds her head up high in the rain
A mother is screaming for help
And she turns around to stare
At a scene from her memory
[Chorus]
Ah...
[Verse 3]
She is hiding a wish in her heart
That flows through her blood always
And it's culled from a dream
That someone is waiting to say her name
And call her to his side at the cusp of eternity
[Chorus]
Ah...
