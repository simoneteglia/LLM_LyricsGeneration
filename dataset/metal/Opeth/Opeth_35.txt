[Intro: Mikael Åkerfeldt]
She told me, why
She told me lies
Always take care of this
I told her how
I've always stayed
Always waiting for nothing
[Verse 1: Mikael Åkerfeldt]
When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I'll find that the years passed us by
When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I'll find that the years passed us by
[Chorus: Mikael Åkerfeldt]
And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes, I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
[Verse 2: Nathalie Lorichs]
When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You'll find that the years passed us by
When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You'll find that those years passed us by
[Chorus: Nathalie Lorichs]
And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes, I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
