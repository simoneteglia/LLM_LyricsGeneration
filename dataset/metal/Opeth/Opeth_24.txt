Liquid is in your throat
for hopeless delight
After all you fell in love with death
Life has aborted all you've had and all you became
The night is calling, you pray forth
A barren waste is your land
Crops, they were sown to die
This skin is a mirror, the eyes hollow with ignorance
Health runs from your lips
Sucked in
and safe from the world of sleep
All years caring for a liar
The barren drift road is winding higher
You're a moth too close to the fire
You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all
Fleeing your sorrows, pushing your spirit away
Sick of the weakness of the psyche
A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a saviour
And cries out, for the restless will also die
A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower
O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself
I wish youâ€™d never come back for us to see the beckoning end
[Instrumental Break]
And the pride of a mother drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son
And the pride of a mother drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son
Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting so clear and so true
Overheard us talking
