I have often told you stories about the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs then maybe you would say
Come lay with me, love me
I would surely stay
Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I will always be
The soldier of fortune
Many times I've been a traveler, I looked for something new
In days of old when the nights were cold
I wandered without you
Those days I thought my eyes could see you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here
Now I feel I'm growing older
And all the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I will always be
The soldier of fortune
I can hear the sound
Of a windmill going round
I guess I will always be
The soldier of fortune
I guess I will always be
The soldier of
Fortune
