[Verse 1: Mikael Åkerfeldt]
Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding from the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight
[Bridge 1: Mikael]
Break of morning, coldness lingers on
Shroud me into nightmares of the sun
[Verse 2: Mikael]
Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears
[Bridge 2: Mikael]
Plunging towards bereavement faster yet
Clearing thoughts, my mind is set
[Chorus:
Steven Wilson
]
Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
[Chorus:
Steven and Mikael
]
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
[Chorus: Steven]
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine
[Verse 3: Mikael]
Help me cure you
Atone for all you've done
Help me leave you
As all the days are gone
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus: Steven]
Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
[Chorus: Steven and Mikael]
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
[Chorus: Steven]
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine
[Bridge 3: Mikael]
Night falls again
Taking what’s left of me
[Outro: Mikael]
Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need
