[Verse 1]
Once again I've cried
Unto the moon
That burning flame
That has guided me
Through all these years, ay
The lake from which you flow
[Verse 2]
With eyes of fire
Once unlit but now alive
This energy, sparkling
Like a morning star
The morning star
[Bridge]
Riding the fires of
The northern gold
I've searched the eye
I laugh under the weeping moon
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
I am the watcher in the skies
Nor the emeralds know my mark
Glisten to mark their presence
Set the enigma ablaze
Searching...
Finding...
[Outro]
Burn the winter landmarks
That said I was there
Burn the spirit of cold
That travel through my soul
