[Verse 1]
In the corner, beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason, I'd never notice
A memory that could hold me back
[Chorus]
There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place
[Verse 2]
Gone through days without talking
There is a comfort in silence
So used to losing all ambition
Struggling to maintain what's left
[Chorus]
There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place
[Verse 3]
Once undone,
there is only smoke
Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up what really happened
Force the darkness unto me
[Chorus]
There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place
