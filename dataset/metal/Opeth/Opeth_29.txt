[Verse 1]
Majesty, faithful me
Pour yourself into me
Wield your power, martyr's price
Stare me down to the ground
[Chorus 1]
The eyes of the devil fixed on his sinners
[Verse 2]
Slake my thirst, eternal wealth
Heathen key 'round my neck
This poetry our blasphemy
Know the sounds of infamy
[Chorus 2]
The hands of Satan assembling his flock
Pale horse rider searching the earth
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Whispered conjuration, a belief takes form
Choking hand tapping the veins in your throat
His orders in your mouth, a decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom spins the undertow of hate
Injected seeds of vengeance, usurper's eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom beckoning in the mist
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Refrain]
The grand conjuration
[Verse 4]
Tell me why
Love subsides
In the light
Of your wish
Say my name
Ease the pain
Clear the smoke
In my head
[Instrumental Outro]
