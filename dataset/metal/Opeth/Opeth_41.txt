[Verse 1]
Still it came passing by
The pieces weaved together rose the sun
And fooled me with another day
The knocking message called for my life
[Verse 2]
Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
Soil to skin, my next of kin
Damp air grasped, stole the words
And greeted me with a hiss
[Verse 3]
This is forgiveness, so I know
Once I repent I seal the lid
I slither for you and I'm dying
I find trust in hate
[Chorus]
They wear white for me
Seemingly jaded and lost
I forge myself into your dreams
And here I am your life
[Bridge]
Hangman, clutching at his tools
I will come for you
[Chorus]
They wear white for me
Seemingly jaded and lost
I forge myself into your dreams
And here I am your life
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
The noose is tied
Murmur through the crowd
Plunging into
Anywhere but here
[Chorus 2]
Cloak-captured sighs of relief
As the primal touch brought me back
And the last sight I did see is still here
Beckoning right behind me
[Guitar Solo]
