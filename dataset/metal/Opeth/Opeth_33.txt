[Verse 1]
Will the children cry when their mother dies?
And in the autumn of their lives will they feel the same?
[Verse 2]
Uoy ees I, natas teews ym
Thginot kcab emoc, draytruoc eht no tuo
(Out on the courtyard, come back tonight
My sweet satan, I see you)
[Verse 3]
Her longing for me coming down like hail
Why did you leave me
Come here inside and tell me how
How in my final days
I'd find the rhyme
[Verse 4]
The light comes on, the signal for us to act out our lives
You wait beneath the white sheets and you wait forever
The light comes on
Your weakness storing trace on your arms
So I left you alone, we all left you alone
[Bridge]
Yhw nosaer ruoy regnol on re'yehT
(They're no longer your reason why)
[Verse 5]
Lock the children away from harm
They're no longer your reason why
Seeking tenderness with a dagger
Skin is marked by the years of trials
[Verse 6]
You felt abandoned in a flock of friends
Singing praise for the dead
Awaited the face of the moon to ascend
And followed the sound in your head
