Lone hunter in the fray of the lonely fading light
A manifest for the garroter stuck to his plight
Young and elder, never mind
Programmed mortal, set lifeline
A mother says no and father cracks a simple plan
A knife is sharpened, his children run but he'll advance
Alas, how fragile life can be
Love is strong when death foresees
Yet the story wonâ€™t end here
No, oh no, oh no
Ulterior motive, the grinning face of leadership
A selfish wish to control a nation in his grip
Strong against weak and immobilized
Secular for fascist lies
The beautiful people look down from ruby vantage points
While in the gutter, starvation invites us to join
Barricades of wealthy youth
Protesting their inborn truth
