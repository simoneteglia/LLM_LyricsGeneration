[Verse 1]
Stay with me awhile
Rise above the vile
Name my final rest
Poured into my chest
[Chorus 1]
Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr
[Verse 2]
Pledge yourself to me
Never leave me be
Sweat breaks on my brow
Given time ends now
[Chorus 1]
Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death, all I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr
[Verse 3]
Spirit painted sin
Embers neath my skin
Veiled in pale embrace
Reached and touched my face
[Chorus 2]
Into the orchard I walk, peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead
(Release your grip, let me go, into the night)
Halo of death, All I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr
