[Verse]
On a wind that's sailing through the morning
I have cut the harness off of my heart
On a tide that's rising with the dawning
I find I belong inside the dark
[PreChorus]
And when the waves roll in to cover me in a shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page
[Chorus]
Carry me home, carry me home
Carry me home, carry me home
Carry me home, carry me home
Carry me home, carry me home
[Verse]
There's a dream that tells me I am haunted
It comes to visit every fortnight or so
I wake up having lost all I ever wanted
And a bleak apparition wants what I hold
[PreChorus]
And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
I am just another ripple in the current of an age
Another crossed out name on another wrinkled page
[Chorus]
Carry me home, carry me home
Carry me home, carry me home
Carry me home, carry me home
Carry me home, carry me home
Should it disappear? Should it go away?
Would it mend the wounds I bear, the wounds of love?
Could it reappear like a familiar tale
Like a broken friendship that snuffs the moonlight above?
[Guitar Solo]
[Organ Solo]
Should be fine, right?
