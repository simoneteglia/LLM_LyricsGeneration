[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Losing sleep, In too deep
Fading sun, What have I done
Came so close to what I need most
Nothing left here
[Verse 2]
Cut the ties, Uncover disguise
Left behind all intertwined
Lost control, Moved out of the role now
Nothing's left here
[Chorus]
Leave it be
It was meant to be
Soul sacrifice
Forgot the advice
Lost track of time
In a flurry of smoke
Waiting anxiety
A fair judgement is served
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
Losing sleep, In too deep
Fading sun, What have I done
Came so close to what I need most
Nothing left here
[Instrumental Outro]
