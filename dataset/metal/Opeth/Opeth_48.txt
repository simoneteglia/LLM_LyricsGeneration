[Verse 1]
Sun hangs high, I turn away
Failure underground
Heart is sick and fever is high
Waiting for a sound
Like a trail of insects to me
I watch them from afar
Feeding
, breeding, scheming
Tell me I am wrong
[Verse 2]
Hiding from discovery
Staring down into the ground
Had they seen the poison in me
A tide of spite wound be found
Moving faster lingering gaze
Feasting on my sanity
A grain of sand against endless waves
A wish for the slaughter of conformity
[Chorus]
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
[Bridge]
Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed
[Solo: Ã…kesson]
[Chorus]
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light and the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Should I speak and they'll call me a liar
I'll retreat to my funeral pyre
[Outro]
My sanctuary, a thousand centuries
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting, I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting
