[Verse 1]
Blank face in the windowpane
Made clear in seconds of light
Disappears and returns again
Counting hours, searching the night
[Verse 2]
Might be waiting for someone
Might be there for us to see
Might be in need of talking
Might be staring directly at me
[Verse 3]
Inside plays a lullaby
Slurred voice over children cry
On the
Inside
[Verse 4]
Haunting loneliness in the eye
Skin covering a secret scar
His hand is waving a goodbye
There's no response or action returned
[Verse 5]
There is deep prejudice in me
Outshines all reason inside
Given dreams all ridden with pain
And projected unto the last
