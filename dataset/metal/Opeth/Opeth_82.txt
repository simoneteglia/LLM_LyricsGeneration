[Verse 1]
Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line
[Chorus 1]
And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away
[Verse 2]
Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line
[Chorus 1]
And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away
[Bridge]
Ice melting into the sea
Your river flowing back to me
[Verse 3]
And when you take your final breath
In many years from now, no less
I hope you feel a peace at heart
Don't be afraid to kiss the dark
[Chorus 2]
And don't ever wonder if I stayed
My love for you can not die away
