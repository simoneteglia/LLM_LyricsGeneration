[Verse 1]
Please remedy my confusion
And thrust me back to the day
The silence of your seclusion
Brings night into all you say
[Chorus]
Pull me down again
And guide me into pain
[Verse 2]
I'm counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep
[Chorus]
Pull me down again
And guide me into...
[Verse 3]
There is failure inside
This test I can't persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criteria is demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder
[Verse 4]
Puzzled by shrewd innocence runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves, nails bleeding from the struggle
It is the end for the weak at heart, always the same
A lullaby for the ones who've lost all reeling inside
My gleaming eye in your necklace reflects stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away, never again
[Bridge]
Spiraling to the ground below like Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away
Waking up to your sound again and lapse into the ways of misery
