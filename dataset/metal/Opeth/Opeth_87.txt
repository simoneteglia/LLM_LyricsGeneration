[Verse 1]
Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me, "How long? How long?"
[Verse 2]
Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Biding my time until courage had build up inside me
Then came clean, "Or am I wrong"
[Verse 3]
I spend all my nights contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth when it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine, "I walk the line"
[Bridge]
A fleeting glance again tells me everything
Took a chance in vain, drown to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness as the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness, paved the way and then gave in
[Verse 4]
I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years so more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we're all born to die
Gave me purpose, freed me, "How simple it can be"
[Chorus]
But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind
[Chorus]
But it's fading away from my mind
There's another "me" waiting behind
