[Intro]
"Det är för bedrövligt. Usch!
Vem fan är du?"
[Verse 1]
Take it as a threat now and leave
Drop of toxins flows to a habit
Tell me what it is you can't see
Teeth grinding flesh in the sabbat
Factual drowning stream, you believe
Slaves will follow conspiracy
Turn the locks on brother and kin
Murder lust on affinity
[Pre-Chorus]
War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry
[Chorus]
The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine
[Verse 2]
Intolerance disguised as a faith
In secrecy we shun empathy
Soul critique online far too late
A throne for the devout enemy
[Pre-Chorus]
War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry
[Chorus]
The parody is real
And we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine
[Outro]
When I was young
So, so much younger than today
It seemed easier to lead your life
There was no time to surrender
And no reason to perceive
The burden of pain
As it passed through our lives every year somehow
And it never really went away
Yet behind my door
Was a kingdom
A secret outline showed the way
To treasures of clay
And beads made of glass
