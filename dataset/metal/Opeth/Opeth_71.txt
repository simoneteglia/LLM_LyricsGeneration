[Intro]
Oh...
Yeah...
[Verse 1]
The memories that now rest in this forest
Forever shadowing the sunrise of my heart
Wings leave their nest at my coming
Swaying away unto the cold glowing sky
Yeah...
Dreaming away for a while
My spirit sighs in peace
Gazing unto the stars
Please, take me there
[Instrumental Break]
Ooh
[Verse 2]
I am so alone, so cold
My heart is to scarred to glow
I wish the sunrise to come
Take my soul (Away)
From this cold, lonely shell
I am free
[Interlude]
Hey
[Guitar Solo]
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
From the eternal sea I rose
Veiled in darkness on either shore
Lost my pride, lost its glow
For me the sun rose no more
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
The forest of October
Sleeps silent when I depart
The web of time
Hides my last trace
[Verse 5]
My blaze travel the last universe
Like the sights of magic
Wrapped in aeons
My mind is one with my soul
I fall alone
While leaves fall from the weeping trees, yeah
[Outro]
Ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ohh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Guitar Solo]
