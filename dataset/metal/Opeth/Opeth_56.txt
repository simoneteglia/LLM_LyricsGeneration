[Instrumental Intro]
Let me taste
Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me
Let nothing interfere
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
Discard your clothes
Let loose your hair
We're intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I'll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
[Instrumental Break]
And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls
[Instrumental Break]
Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we've always knew
That nothing ever changes
[Instrumental Break]
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from the inside
Depending on the life blood
Rise to submission
I'm still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from the inside
Silently
Whispering
Move in me
and
set me free
