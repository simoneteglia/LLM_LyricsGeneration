[Verse 1]
Eternal rains will come
We should say goodbye
And suffer on our own
As all our thoughts were wrong
[Chorus]
So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
And when the flood comes to drown us
There is nothing we can do
[Verse 2]
You told me not to wait
Unless I could wait forever
Because there is no time for us
Take comfort in what was
[Chorus]
So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through
And when the flood comes to drown us
There is nothing we can do
[Bridge]
Here it comes, our death comes
And in my sleep I can't forget
[Outro]
Reaching for the surface, I see you
