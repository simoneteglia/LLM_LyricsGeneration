Silent dance with death, everything is lost
Torn by the arrival of Autumn
The blink of an eye, you know it's me
You keep the dagger close at hand
And you saw nothing
False love turned to pure hate
The wind cried a lamentation
Before merging with the grey
Demon, demon of the fall
Demon, demon of the fall
Demon, demon of the fall
Demon, demon of the fall
Gasping for another breath
She rose, screaming at closed doors
Seductive faint mist forging
Through the cracks in the wall
I shan't resist
In tears for all of eternity
She turned around and faced me for the first time
Run away, run away, run away
Run away, run away, run away
Just one second, and I was left with nothing
Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air
That day came to an end
And she had lost in me, her
CREDENCE
