[Verse 1]
I am a sinner and I worship evil
Blood is thinner but you will never know
Can you confess that you thrive in chaos?
You're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost
But you're dying
It's in your eyes
[Verse 2]
You're a charlatan
, you get everything you wish
You're a harlot
,
carry poison in your kiss
Beg forgiveness with a dagger in your hand
Sow your death seed and reap the dying lands
But you're crying
It's only vice
[Bridge]
Empty vessel
Drained of
hope
And none the lesser at the end of
A rope
Have you ever hated like I?
Know I still awaited the absence of lies
Watch your eager tongue
Attack me from behind
[Verse 3]
Riddle whispers, bleak futile control
Like a twin sister adapting to a role
You're a murderer, bloodlust increase
You're a harvester, come close to spread disease
And you're hiding
I hear you cry
