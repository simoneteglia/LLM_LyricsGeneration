Our abode 'mongst the stars is waiting
Long enough for our last breath of life
You stare at nothing, right through me
At times resembling the Devil's concubine
And me, I am the idol that would long
To caress our eyes until they would open no more
I would comfort you if I only could
But as we all know by now... I am just thin air
Unaware as you are of my presence
You are losing yourself
Hiding within THE AMEN CORNER
