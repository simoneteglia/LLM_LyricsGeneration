Into the trees
Past meadow grounds
And further away from my home
Baying behind me
I hear the hounds
Flock's chasing to find me alone
A trail of sickness leading to me
If I am haunted then you will see
Searching the darkness and emptiness
I'm hiding away from the sun
Will never rest, never be at ease
All my matter's expired so I run
A trail of sickness leading to me
If I am haunted then you will see
There falls another
Vapor hands released the blade
Insane regrets at the drop
Instruments of death before me
Lose all to save a little at your peril it's justified
And dismiss your demons as death becomes a jest
You are the laughing stock of the absent minded
Confessions stuck in your mouth and long gone fevers reappear
Nocturnally helpless and weak in the light
Depending on a prayer
Pacing deserted roads to find a seed of hope
They are the trees
Rotten pulp inside and never well
Roots are sucking, thieving from my source
Tired boughs reaching for the light
It is all false pretension, harlequin forest
Awaiting redemption for a lifetime
As they die alone with no one by their side
Are they forgiven?
Stark determination poisoning the soul
Unfettered beast inside claiming sovereign control
And now the woods are burning, tearing life crops asunder
Useless blackened remains, still pyre smoldering
