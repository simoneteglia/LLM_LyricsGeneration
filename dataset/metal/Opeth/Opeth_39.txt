[Verse 1]
There's a sense of longing in me as I read Rosemary's letter
Her writing's honest
Can't forget the years she's lost in isolation
She talks about her love
And as I read, "I'll die alone"
I know she's aching
[Verse 2]
There's a certain detail seen here
The pen must have slipped to the side
And left a stain next to his name
She knows he's gone and isolation is all that would remain
"The wound in me is pouring out to rest on a lover's shore"
