[Verse 1]
I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading
I try to forget you as you forgot me
This time there is nothing left for you to take
This is goodbye
[Pre-Chorus]
Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay
[Chorus]
And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away
[Verse 2]
Close to ending it all,
I am drifting through the stages
Of the rapture born within this loss
Thoughts of death inside
Tear me apart from the core of my soul
[Pre-Chorus]
Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay
[Chorus]
And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away
[Bridge]
At times, the dark's fading slowly
But it never sustains
Would someone watch over me
In my time of need?
[Pre-Chorus]
Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay
[Chorus x2]
And I should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I should step out of the rain
Turn away
