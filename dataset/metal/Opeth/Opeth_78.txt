No more wishes for the past
No lingering of sages and seers
And desperations and fevers last
The undertows are stronger here
And here I lie, another morning arrives
Too far away from coming home
I see a face in the snow, inside my head a voice calls for me
I see your face in the snow and outside the sun's too far away to feel
And here I lie, another morning arrives
Too far away from coming home
And here I lie, another morning arrives
Too far away from coming home
And could we live within the wake of aging lies
When we're too far away?
