[Verse 1]
Returned from a hibernal dream
Voices fell like marble
No longer by my side
Gone all that would linger
[Verse 2]
Ripped from my embrace
Melinda reflected in shafts
Red line round her neck
Met the earth in silence
[Chorus]
White faced haggard grin
In this serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath
White faced haggard grin
In this serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath
[Verse 3]
Saw her fading
Blank stare into me
Clenched fist
From the beautiful pain
[Verse 4]
Darkness reared its head
Tearing within the reeling haze
Took control, claiming my flesh
Piercing rage, perfect tantrum
Each and every one would die at my hand
Choking in warm ponds of blood
At last, weak and torn, I went down
Drained from strength, flickering breath
[Verse 5]
Came with the moon
The wayward in concious state
Flanked and barred in destiny's end
Underneath with hope in laches
Swathed in filth, any would betoken
Starlit shadows on the wall
Finally there to collect me
From the bowels of sin
[Chorus]
White faced haggard grin
In this serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath
White faced haggard grin
In this serenity painted death
With a halo of bitter disease
Black paragon in lingering breath
