[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
There's a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It's a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode
In the hour of death
There's a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the sign once again
If even for a second
[Verse 2]
I hear a voice in the air
It has a warning to share
"Don't believe what you see"
"You can't perceive what you feel"
But if I do what I'm told
And shun the spirit I hold
I'm no longer a human
And I won't shift with the sands
[Chorus]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
[Verse 3]
There are moments of doubt
When I don't know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there's too much shouting
About how I should choose
Incapacitated, I'm left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
Storm coming, I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
He lives in you
He lives in you
