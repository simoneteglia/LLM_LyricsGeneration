[Verse 1]
I am awaiting the sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came, you lied
Embracing us over autumn's proud treetops
[Verse 2]
I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
Your voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again
[Chorus]
Devotion eludes and in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes, I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered: "I know..."
[Outro]
We walked into the night
Am I to bid you farewell?
Why can't you see that I try?
When every tear I shed is for you?
