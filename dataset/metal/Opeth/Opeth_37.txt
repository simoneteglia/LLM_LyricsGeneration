[Verse 1]
Rose of Summer, withered times
Shadows fall on contouring lines
Far beyond a sleeping wish
Lunar tongue on a lasting bliss
[Chorus]
Dead within a dream
Icy river stream
[Post-Chorus]
Lend yourself
[Verse 2]
Clouds of dust in a waning light
You have given up on plight
Time is now, my dearest friend
Hidden years and a heart to mend
And should we meet again
The loss of everything
Three wishes to a friend
Three hundred sorrows gather
But if we lend ourselves
Amidst rock and poison grime
There may well be a time
A kingdom past its prime
[Chorus]
Dead within a dream
Icy river stream
[Bridge]
Your silver voice in my throat
Potion without an antidote
A routine death for the well-immersed
After all, the years have left us cursed
A simple test in an iron cage
Old tradition in a modern age
Strong and true are the weak at heart
I am you, you am I
[Outro]
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
