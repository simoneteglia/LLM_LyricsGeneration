[Verse 1]
Seven milestones...
Under a watching autumn eye
Contorted trees are spreading forth
The message of the wind
[Bridge]
With frozen hands I rode with the stars
Ooh
[Verse 2]
With anger the wind blew
Giving wings to my stallion
Clouds gathered across the moon
Blazing the white light
Come on
Blazing the white light
[Bridge]
Passing the lake I know so well
I am near, yet so far away
Ay
[Verse 3]
Arrival...
I saw her shadow in the darkness
Awaiting me like the night
Awaits the day (Day, day)
Standing silent smiling at my presence
A black candle holds the only light
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
[Verse 4]
Ooh, darkness encloses
And the candle seem to expire
In her cold, cold hand
And as a forlorn soul
It will fade away
[Bridge]
Yeah
Yeah
Ah, yeah
Yeah
Whoa
[Verse 5]
Yeah...
Touching her flesh in this night
My blood froze forever
Embraced before the dawn
A kiss brought total eclipse
[Outro]
Ah...
And she spoke
Once and forever
I am so cold
In mist enrobed the twilight
She was standing...
