[Verse 1]
A voice through vapor
20 yards ahead
Is calling for your name
The empty paper
Waiting on the bed
It sets the waiting game
[Refrain]
Credits to a dream
[Chorus]
You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you
[Verse 2]
Ghost of memories, heavy on my brow
But changing over time
New ambitions corrupting every vow
Unfolding lovelorn crime
[Refrain]
Credits to a dream
[Chorus]
You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you
Yes, I will always wait for you
