Show me a sign of troubles in your heart
Spare me your lies and tell me that you're mine
And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise
Made me a slave to the secrets of your silence
But you told me to stay
And you told me you're mine
And our bodies float on the river
To the oceans of demise
In light of all things to come, why do you despair?
Because when you have no one, no one would care
So don't care
And all things will come undone
There is nothing to share
I'll be waiting for no one
And no one is there to care
Can't see, can't feel
You run, I long
I wait, he comes
Takes you away
In the embers of summer
All things must die
There's a passage of fire ahead
Fire on the other side
There comes a time when the river runs dry
Winter comes and we sacrifice
Our lives
