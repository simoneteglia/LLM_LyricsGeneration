[Verse 1]
Empty house and empty pockets
There's an echo in the hall
I keep your picture in a locket
In the past, we had it all
But the Summer fades away
Rainy day tomorrow
[Verse 2]
In the company of dawning
In the presence of a friend
I was subject to a wanting
And unable to ascend
So I opened up my gate
It’s too late to wonder
[Interlude]
"Det är bara en ny dag, inget särskilt har hänt"
[Chorus]
Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride
[Bridge]
You are moving away from home
Escaping the monochrome
One after another
Striding along the road
Past the crest, you will be free
Laid to rest now, let it be
Honest promise to a degree
The edge too sharp for guarantees
[Chorus]
Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride
[Outro]
A part of our past is still there
Underneath your shoes
The memory's stuck in your chest
The idle truth is up to you
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
Life is so fragile, I know
And even if I heard
A yearning voice in your heart
Old routines always kept us apart
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
