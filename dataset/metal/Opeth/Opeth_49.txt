[Refrain]
Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear
[Verse 1]
Someone dies within creation
Doubts in everlasting life
How to lie to one innocent child
You are loved, I'm execrated
You belong, I circle strife
Routine pathways in escape from the wild
[Chorus]
We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence
[Refrain]
Every morrow, every year
Choir of sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear
[Chorus]
We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence
We are left in a world that's burning
Crawling through embers to safety
And my name is next to last
Feast on famine and death on the broadcast
[Bridge]
Finding friends in algorithms
Forgot the sound of my daughter's voice
Please remind me of my emptiness
The hissing of machines lost rhythm
As death would give an interview
In a metropolitan holiness
I am outside waiting
Outside waiting
I am outside waiting
Outside waiting
[Outro]
Am I the last one of my kind
Who's afraid of dying?
But I would perish to save a child
And give all I can for love
It seems I might have reconciled
Even if my destiny's lying
For the ones I hold dear I hold close
And force my way through the ether
