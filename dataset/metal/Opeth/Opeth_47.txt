[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse]
Found a way to rid myself clean of pain
And a fever that's been haunting me has gone away
Looking through my window
I seem to recognize all the people passing by
But I'm alone and far from home
Nobody knows me
Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
All days are in darkness and I'm biding my time
Once I am sure of my task I will rise again
[Guitar Solo]
