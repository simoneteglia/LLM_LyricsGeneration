[Instrumental Intro 00:00-02:20]
Confessor of the tragedies in man
Lurking in the core of us all
The last dying call for the ever lost
Brief encounters, bleeding pain
[Instrumental Interlude 02:42-05:38]
Lepers coiled neath the trees
Dying men in bewildered soliloquies
Perversions bloom around the bend
Seekers, lost in their quest
Ghosts of friends frolic under the waning moon
[Instrumental Break]
It is the year of death
Wielding his instruments
Stealth sovereign reaper
Touching us with ease
[Guitar Solo]
Infecting the roots in an instant
Burning crop of disease
I am just a spectator
An advocate documenting the loss
Fluttering with conceit
This doesn't concern me yet
Still far from the knell
Taunting their bereavement
[Instrumental Break]
Mob round the dead
Point fingers at the details
Probing vomits for more
Caught in unbridled suspense
[Instrumental Break]
We have all lost it now
Catching the flakes of dismay
Born the travesty of man
Regular pulse midst pandemonium
You're plucked to the mass
Parched with thirst for the wicked
Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark
The sun sets forever over Blackwater Park
[Acoustic Outro]
