[Verse 1]
Deserted again, you speak to me through the shadows
Walking in closed rooms, using cold words
Captured by the night
The yearning escapes from my embrace
[Verse 2]
Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts
Scream your sadness
And they all turned away
Unable to face more of this death
[Verse 3]
Credence in my word
Written in dust
Tainted by memories
I confess my hope
Recognize my loneliness
[Verse 4]
Your laughter weeps the truth
Push me into the corner
Confirming the epitaph of my soul
And displaying the once unknown
KARMA
