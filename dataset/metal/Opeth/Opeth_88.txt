[Intro]
I am going away, I am going down
I am going away, I am going down
[Verse]
Sifting through a memory
Before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy
A million words astray
[Chorus]
Ah....
[Verse]
I can't remember happiness
I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness
Is a veil that keeps my calm
[Chorus]
Ah....
[Verse]
By the way, I'm doing fine
I have a place to stay, just behind the sunshine
And by the way, don't need sympathy
I have a place to lay, I'm more than you can see
I walk the streets alone at night
It helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light
And leave all woes behind
[Chorus]
Ah....
