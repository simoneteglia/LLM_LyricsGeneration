[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
The sigh of summer upon my return
Fifteen alike since I was here
Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
Snuffing the first morning rays
Weary from what might have been ages
Still calm with my mind at peace
Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
The lapse of the moment took its turn
[Verse 2]
I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
Wearing my death-mask at birth
The hands of God, decrepit and thin
Cold caress and then nothing
I was taken away from my plight
A treason bestowed to the crowd
Branded a Jonah with fevered blood
Ungodly freak, defiler
[Verse 3]
Pale touch, writhing in the embers
Damp mud burning in my eyes
All the faces turned away
And all would sneer at my demise
[Verse 4]
Outcast with dogmas forged below
Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
No mercy would help me on my way
In the pouring rain, nothing is the same
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Vows in ashes
I pledge myself to no one
Seethed and spiteful
All shudder at the call of my name
[Chorus]
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear all of me
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 5]
There is no forgiveness in these eyes
For any of you but one
Dispel the mist for now
Melinda is the reason why I've come
[Verse 6]
She is water drops over the pyre
A thistle in my hands
Stained and torn, aged and brown
Virtuous shell with kindred innocence
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I awoke from the miasma
Passing swiftly through the moor
This is here, waters stir
And in the distance, all that was lost
[Chorus]
If you'll bear with me
You'll fear all of me
You'd never leave me to
A fate with you
