[Verse 1]
Ghost of Mother lingering death
Ghost on Mother's bed
Black strands on the pillow contour of her health
Twisted face upon the head
Ghost of perdition stuck in her chest
A warning no one read
Tragic friendship called inside the fog
Pouring venom brew deceiving
[Refrain]
Devil cracked the earthly shell foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said
"You have to live before you die young"
Devil cracked the earthly shell foretold she was the one
Blew hope into the room and said
"You have to live before you die young"
[Verse 2]
Holding her down channeling darkness
Hemlock for the Gods
Fading resistance, draining the weakness
Penetrating inner light
[Bridge 1]
Road into the dark unaware
Winding ever higher
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Darkness by her side spoke and passed her by
Dedicated hunter waits to pull us under
Rose up to its call, in his arms she'd fall
Mother light received, a faithful servant's free
[Pre-Chorus]
In time the hissing of her sanity
Faded out her voice and soiled her name
Like the marked pages in a diary
Everything seemed clean that is unstained
The incoherent talk of ordinary days
Why would we really need to live?
Decide what's clear and what's within a haze
What you should take and what to give
[Chorus]
Ghost of perdition
A saint's premonition's unclear
Keeper of holy hordes
Keeper of holy whores
[Bridge 2]
To see a beloved son in despair of what's to come
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
If one cut the source of the flow and everything would change
Would conviction fall in the shadow of the righteous?
The phantasm of your mind might be calling you to go
Defying the forgotten morals where the victim is the prey
