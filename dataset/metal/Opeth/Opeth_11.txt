[Verse 1]
We entered Winter once again
Naked, freezing from my breath
Neath the lid all limbs tucked away
This coffin is your abode from now and onwards
[Chorus 1]
Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears
[Verse 2]
I am beyond death
Midst a dreaming affinity
Saving strength now, faint whispers
Come erotic communion in its splendour
[Verse 3]
Fever mirrored ghosts
Night time consolation, cross the line
Draw murder into art
Sleep inside through days
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
In the wake of this relief
Shivering, longing for more
Insanity at its peak
Love me to my death
[Bridge]
Lost are days of Spring
You sighed and let me in
Keep the beast inside
Shackled within my hide
Screaming out too late
Losing to my hate
Grew together with your skin
And paced the trails of sin
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 5]
Your gaze covered with virgin snow
Rigid features
It's the shallow deeds who is to blame
Deafening shrieks pierced the night
[Chorus 2]
A step from oblivion
Moving into the dim lights
Hiding within a reverie
It was worth it for the wait alone
[Chorus 1]
Your body is mine to avail
Such a tragic sight you are
Slave under my creed
Spurring me with those tears
[Instrumental Outro]
