[Verse 1]
Marauder
Staining the soil, midst of stillness
Beloved fraternity to an end
Red eyes probe the scene
All the same
Stilted for the beholder
Depravity from the core
Hand carved death in stone laden aisles
[Verse 2]
I hide the scars from my past
Yet they sense my (mute) dirge
This is when it all falls apart
White hands grasping for straws
[Refrain]
Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised man-made nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down
Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen
[Chorus]
Searching my way to perplexion
The gleam of her eyes, in that moment she knew
[Verse 3]
Thought I could not leave this place on this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn to what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay?
No one would know
What would they care if I did stay?
No one should know
Thought I could not leave this place on this imminent day
As I've reached the final dawn to what's gone astray
What would they care if I did stay?
No one would know
What would they care if I did stay?
No one should know
[Verse 4]
Still brooding, soothing calm
That rigid, twisted face
Blank godhead, tear my name
Lost virtue, frantic lust
[Refrain]
Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
Undisguised man-made nova
Mute cry, don't dare to tread
Searing beams tracking you down
Adoring what never has been
Some will bring with them all they have seen
[Chorus]
Searching my way to perplexion
In crumbling faith I saw her
Bearing her pain in the wilderness
The gleam of her eyes, in that moment she knew
