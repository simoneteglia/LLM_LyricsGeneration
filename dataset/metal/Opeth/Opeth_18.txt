[Verse 1]
Come into this night, here we'll be gone
So far away from our weak and crumbling lives
Come into this night, when days are done
Lost and astray in what's vanished from your eyes
[Refrain]
What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright
[Verse 2]
Come into this night, your plight alone
Carry your weight, you are flawed as all of us
Come into this night - your only home
It's never too late to repent, suffer the loss
[Refrain]
What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright
[Instrumental]
[Refrain]
What came and distorted your sight
Saw you benighted by your fright
[Verse 3]
Come into this night, when you're able
To undo your deeds
and atone with your lonely soul
Once you're into this night, all minds are stable
Forget all your needs, lose the grip of all control
