Heal myself, a feather on my heart
Look inside, there never was a start
Peel myself, dispose of severed skin
All subsides around me and within
There's nothing painful in this, there's no upheaval
Redemption for my pathos, all sins undone
[Instrumental Break]
Awaiting word on what's to come
In helpless prayers a hope lives on
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised
In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness
[Instrumental Outro]
