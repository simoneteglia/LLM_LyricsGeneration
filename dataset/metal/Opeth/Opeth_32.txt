It was me, peering through the looking-glass
Beyond the embrace of Christ
Like the secret face within the tapestry
Like a bird of prey over the crest
And she was swathed in sorrow, as if born within its mask
Her candlelight snuffed, the icon smiled
Emptiness followed in her wake
I could clasp her in undying love
Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine
She faced me in awe
'Twas a token of ebony colour
Embodied in faint vapour
Wandering through April's fire
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you
I will endure, hide away
I would outrun the scythe, glaring with failure
It is a mere destiny I thought, a threshold I had crossed before
[Instrumental Interlude]
The rain was waving goodbye, and when the night came
The forest folded its branches around me
Something passed by, and I went into a dream
She laughing and weeping at once: "Take me away"
I don't know how or why, I'll never know when
