[Verse 1]
There is a light that hits the gloom around
Shows the footprints round this grave
Dried up roses scattered on the mound
Honouring the one engraved
[Bridge]
Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"
[Chorus]
Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait
[Verse 2]
Black procession through the narrow aisles
Another's gone for all to see
Near the site for one who lost his trials
Sleeping 'neath the ground is me
[Bridge]
Will ever the morning
Carry away
The souls of those for whom we cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Leaving, grieving
Seeking, meeting
Binding, unwinding
Sighing, "you"
[Chorus]
Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait
[Chorus]
Still day beneath the sun
Asking you who is the one
And when the day is late
We know who must forever wait
