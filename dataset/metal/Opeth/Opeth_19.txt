[Refrain]
Long days, slow waste
Sew lies, sow hate
[Verse 1]
So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams
No more
[Refrain]
Long days, long days
[Verse 2]
And again he rides in
It's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish hunter
A thousand lies, cast from the throne of secrecy
Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust believer
Your body - a vehicle to house his disease
[Verse 3]
Pearls before swine, they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king, dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow
A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles
Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes, waiting
Spiraling judgment, provoked in the rains
[Bridge]
This futile test drowned in the levee of deception
This futile test drowned in the levee of deception
[Outro]
In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgment
Heir Apparent
