What is left when the morning comes
Is the memory of a future
And when my plight is done
There is nothing left to hold onto
There were friends waiting at my door
They are gone now, for the year is new
I stuck by my word
And when the rains came
Made it true and pure, to dissolve the hurt
Are we nursing destruction?
Pursuing a dream we once had
Was it our intention
To follow this road 'til the end
Even if the end is a world of sorrow?
There is a bond between us
Even if it's frayed it is unbreakable
So I come for you always
And I welcome pain
For a second of belonging somewhere
There were times when I lost my way
With hope pouring from my soul
In a shelter from the sun
I don't want to bare my scars for you - x3
