An afternoon walk through the park
I keep to the shadows until it's dark
I am not educated nor free of sin
I carry thoughts of giving in
There is a void surrounding me
No sound, and in the black I can not see
There is a chasm between you and me
You have no face, no body, no words to speak
There is a wickedness in me
I can't seem to make it go away
I am a spiritual leper but I can see
A flock of believers gone astray
There's eternal night in my gaze
I'm cast out and I am not like you
Find my way on through the haze
I'm liquefied in a strange brew
An early morn walk through the park
I look to the sun when it's cold and stark
I blend with the crows of robot minds
Never a leader, I am always behind
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
