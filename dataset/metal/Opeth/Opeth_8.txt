[Verse 1]
I once upon a time carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye, a broken rhyme I'd underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you
[Break 1]
Sorrow in me
[Verse 2]
Saw a movement in their eyes
Said, I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost
,
a passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand
[Break 2]
Waiting to fail
[Keyboard Solo]
[Break 3]
Failing again
[Verse 3]
If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear, you've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you
[Guitar Solo]
[Acoustic Guitar Outro]
