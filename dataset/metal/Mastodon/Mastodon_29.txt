[Verse 1: Brann Dailor &
Troy Sanders
]
Within a bruised heart
I'll just say when
Just one time before
It will come again
Little voice inside
Inside my head
Tell me when it's time to turn around again
All appears to fade away
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
I can see your face
And I feel the pain
And I feel the shame that I have let you down again
People everywhere
Not a drop to drink
Not a dare to think  about the damage I have done
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor &
Troy Sanders
]
Try to give up what weighs
What weighs you down
The only control you have
Is all your own
Do I fit the pieces
Together again
Or do I leave them lying on the floor?
All appears to fade away
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
I can see your face
And I feel the pain
And I feel the shame that I have let you down again
People everywhere
Not a drop to drink
Not a dare to think  about the damage I have done
[Bridge: Troy Sanders & Brann Dailor]
Leaving you behind
Is the hardest thing I've done
Asking where did I go wrong?
I wonder what all of this makes
Does fortune favor the bold?
I only know that leaving you
Was the hardest thing
To cut and run
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
I can see your face
And I feel the pain
And I feel the shame that I have let you down again
People everywhere
Not a drop to drink
Not a dare to think  about the damage I have done
