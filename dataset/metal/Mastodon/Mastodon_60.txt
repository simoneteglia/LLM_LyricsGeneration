(Troy Sanders)
Wide is the line
Separates the rivers from the dirt
All the while I wonder who's the one
(Scott Kelly)
Within the one and only eye
Within the one and only eye
Within the one and only eye
Within the one and only eye
(Troy Sanders)
Can you see there's a child
Standing idle by us in this mess
Who am I to cause this emptiness
(Scott Kelly)
Willing the sea
To cleanse my soul of all I've been
To bring me free to this clarity
Clarity
(Troy Sanders)
Trouble rolls in
As the tides, they twist and make the turn
Pain subsides and sweeps across the earth again
(Scott Kelly)
Willing the sea
To cleanse my soul of all that I've been
To bring me free to this clarity
Clarity
Within the one and only eye
Within the one and only eye
Within the one and only eye
Within the one and only eye
I'm standing deep in these waters
Bleeding free and bent to drag us onto new visions
Only loss fills my void
Only loss fills my void
Only loss fills my void
Only the void connects me
With these mountains of dust, blood and soil
The stones born in the flames of truth
Demand a sacrifice
Don't just bleed us and leave us to ourselves
We will return so deeply harmed, and we will shatter you
