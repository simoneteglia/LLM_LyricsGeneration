I saw the mountain crumble down
I saw colossus in flames
I heard the ocean draining
Nothing that I could ever tame
Off with my head, come down the line
I have the right to decide
The brain is wide, as is the sky
Altered minds, they criticize
Unrest within your flesh
How can we stop this pollution?
Causing trouble, you cannot fix
Envy of others never makes me rich
All my heroes, they're all dead
As I remain here inside my
We have heard the chimes at midnight
Into the void I go
Will I ever see your face again?
Or will black be all I know?
Writhng inside
Our hearts alive
And the darkness here is grim
Running from the surrounded
Lead me deep into the canyon
You put your guidance in the wrong hands
Feet are grounded, given your best
Now take your gold into silence
You take a stand, bracing yourself
For this cold is never ending
We have heard the chimes at midnight
Into the void I go
Will I ever see your face again?
Or will black be all I know?
Writhng inside
Our hearts alive
