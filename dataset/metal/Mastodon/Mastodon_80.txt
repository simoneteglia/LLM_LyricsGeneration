[Laughter]
[Verse 1]
I saw the creature fall
Into the swamp from which he spawned
I heard them laugh and say
They never liked him anyway
[Verse 2]
I tried to talk to them
To help you on your feet again
They laughed and said to me
The swamp is right where I should be
[Refrain]
The creature lives
The creature lives
The creature lives
The creature lives
