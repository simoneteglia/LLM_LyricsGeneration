[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
Elephant spirits
Tower of ivory
Story of ancient deities
[Chrous 1: Brent Hinds]
Seizer
Of the fleece
Protector
Of this place
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Fly through dreamscapes
Of valleys, gullies, and spires
Herd across suicidal slopes
[Chorus 2: Brent Hinds]
Changeless
Moon shines
Circle
Cyclops image
[Verse 3: Troy Sanders]
A race of one-eyed beings
All feared and shunned
Rakshasa demon
[Chorus 1: Brent Hinds]
Seizer
Of the fleece
Protector
Of this place
[Bridge: Brann Dailor]
Eyes all around you
Enter the labyrinth
Visions of the hunted
Beware the Birchmen
[Outro: Troy Sanders]
Incisors
Thought to be
Skulls of us
