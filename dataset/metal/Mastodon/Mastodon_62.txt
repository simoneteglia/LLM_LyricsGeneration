[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
I think I'm ready to start
I thought I heard you scream
We're all part of this fucked up devastation (Go)
Always spinning the wheels
A greater vision in sight
It's not failure if you're trying
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Another prick of a thorn
The body reaches deep
As I choke the situation
Seeming clever and wise
Clouded beyond the dark cells
I know not what drips inside me
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Pushing the tides
Trying not to go down and taken under
Pushing the tides
Try to keep my head above the water
[Verse 3: Troy Sanders]
(Go)
You try untying the weight
And you continue to breathe
I remove you for protection
And where to go from here
A place you value the most
Such a brilliant realization
[Chorus: Brann Dailor &
Troy Sanders
]
Pushing the tides
Trying not to go down and taken under
Pushing the tides
Try to keep my head above the water
Pushing the tides
Leading us to prevail
And all we desire
Pushing the tides
With every ounce of strength I have
