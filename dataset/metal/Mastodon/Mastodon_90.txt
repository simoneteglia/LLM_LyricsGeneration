[Verse 1]
Give and take
We are full of pride
All is proved in time
[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down
Stand my ground
Lay me down
Stand my ground
[Chorus]
Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes
Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes
[Verse 2]
Rule by the head
Endure the test of time
Plant the seed of mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down
Stand my ground
Lay me down
Stand my ground
[Chorus]
Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes
Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes
