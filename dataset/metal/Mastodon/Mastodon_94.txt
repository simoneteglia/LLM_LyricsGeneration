[Chorus]
Going through the
Deep icy waves
Thrown in
End all because death waits
[Verse 1]
Throughout during the winter
Guardian of land and sea
Standing close to the throne
Violent 'cause I cannot see
Power royalty
Our presidents hanging
No one left here anymore
[Chorus]
Going through the
Deep icy waves
[Verse 2]
Icy squall on the tundra
Obedience how we reign
Enjoy the sights we know
Soon it will be turned
Grovel, life expelled
Become Immortal
Forceful hand, unfeeling
[Bridge]
Howling dead are near
Sordid tale of man
Molten rock renown
Distant brother of man
Howling dead are near
Sordid tale of man
[Chorus]
Going through the
Deep icy waves
Thrown in
End all because death waits
