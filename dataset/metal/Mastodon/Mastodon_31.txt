[Refrain: Brent Hinds]
Capillarian
Gone away
Capillarian
Gone away
[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
It's a shattered wave
Cosmogenic cycles
Universal dreams
The unseen essence
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
Energies refreshed
Twelve years of silence
Frivolous to moments
Shake the hand of lightning
[Refrain: Brent Hinds]
Capillarian
Carnate
Capillarian
Carnate
[Instrumental Break 01:06-02:33]
[Bridge: Brent Hinds]
You don't have to go
Escaping from the long way
And leave us here all alone
Carve, carve out your soul
Lay it on the altar
And leave us here all alone
[Instrumental Break 02:57-03:37]
[Verse 3: Brent Hinds]
This river is running violence
A way to catch our breath
Rising from the mercury
We will climb to bestow our trust
Take away the anchor
Amplify the mystery
Inhale the Earth and wind
Map out the plans to our test
