[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
We heard tale White Walker
We heard them all dead
Then come Old Man Winter
He'll rip us all to shreds
Hide away your children
Then hide away yourselves
Dig deep into mountain
Dig far beyond the spell
[Chorus]
They come down
They come down The Wall
They come down
They come down The Wall
[Verse 2]
You can hear their footsteps
Crunch the fresh-fell snow
And you can hear them feasting
Oh, tell me, where's my crow?
Oh, I bring every armory
Sharpening their blade
I pray for every one of them
And sacrifices made
[Chorus]
They come down
They come down The Wall
They come down
They come down The Wall
[Verse 3]
So beware, you king and commoner
Be ready, young and old
Nevermind the game inside the realm
For it's no match for winter's cold
[Chorus]
They come down
They come down The Wall
They come down
They come down The Wall
[Outro]
To save us all
To save us all
