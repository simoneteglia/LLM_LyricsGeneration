North side star's coming on down
But it ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you
West side is coming on down
It ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you
The countdown's begun
The world is ending
Where are we now?
And what have we done?
And how will I know?
That you are the one
It's getting cold outside
But it ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you
North star has fallen to the ground
It rolls back the eyes around you
All around you
West side is coming on down
It ain't gonna be around for you
Around for you
The countdown's begun
The world is ending
Where are we now?
And what have we done?
And how will I know?
That you are the one
You and I
We could expire
Right here and now
Wouldn't matter at all
I can't clean this blood off my hands
I can't get the stains out, I tried
But maybe if we look ahead
We can clear this wreck to the side
You and I
We could expire
Right here and now
Wouldn't matter at all
The world starts beginning to slow
Rust and bone come up from the ground
Come here and disguise me as love
Death has been shattered from sun
