Black sheep, part of the sun, dope sick, 20 to run
(You're living all over)
Fates, clamps, look at the stars, 38 under, new to the yard
(You're living all over)
Feats, shots, lots of fun, two in the face, what are the odds?
(You're living all over)
Why'd you bring it out, my brother? I'm just trying to get me right
I don't need no fucking drama, god damn, god damn, in a fight
Why'd you get me undercover? Why'd you get me in your sights?
You don't like me, mother fucker, think it's so funny, have my knife

Comin' out of a faster on a standing corner grateful junkies razor blades and rolling papers Santa claus and friendly rapists basketball and acid dropping all the type of Bible dropping free to district in the center ecstasy on Erowid
"You don't, you don't hear any songbirds around here. They're so beautiful, bound up, motionless. It's like they're in a god damn dream. Hahahahahahahaha"
