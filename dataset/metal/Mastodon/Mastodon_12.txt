I'd guess they would say
We could set this world ablaze
Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around
It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around
Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around
Faltering footsteps
Dead end path
All that I need is this wise man's staff
Encased in crystal he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze
Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around
I guess they would say we can set the world ablaze
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around
Take my black soul
Arrive in the fires that burn my skin
Guide my eyes all through this maze
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze
All that I have seen
Standing on the edge
The foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords
Quickly to the shore
The last baron
The last baron
Ghost of man
Surrounds me in my slumber
I have no fear
As your wing is my shelter
Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes
Faith in mystic power
The last baron
The last baron
Will he save me?
Will he save me?
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
I was standing staring at the world
And I can't see it
All that I have seen
Standing on the edge
The foot of precipice
Floating in the sea
Past the king of swords
Quickly to the shore
The last baron
The last baron
Ghost of man
Surrounds me in my slumber
I have no fear
As your wing is my shelter
Cyanide he craves
Coursing through his veins
Providing him with strength
To see this to the end
Afraid of psychic eyes
Faith in mystic power
The last baron
The last baron
Will he save me?
Will he save me?
Will he save me?
I guess they would say
We can set this world ablaze
Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around
It is hard to see
Through all the haze at the top of the trees
Hold my head on stable ground
Watch as the earth falls all around
Please, please take my hand
Please take my soul to rest
So we can always be around
Faltering footsteps, dead end path
All that I need is this wise man's staff
Encased in crystal he leads the way
I guess they'd say we could set the world ablaze
