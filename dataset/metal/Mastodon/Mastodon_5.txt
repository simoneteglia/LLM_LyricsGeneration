[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
Tired and lost
No one to trust
Who is there to give the push?
All I have learned
Straighten the curve
Like a circle to return
[Chorus 1: Brent Hinds]
The long embrace
The smell of dirt and roses
Under the sun
No sign of bread or water
I fall asleep under blankets of stars
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Ice hit you cold
Heat of surprise
Bending mind can't realize
Faith is in me
End I can see
Tears are strong as ten thousand tongues
[Chorus 2: Brent Hinds]
My sweet mirage
I bathe in sacred waters
I kiss the Sky
Floating in Sultans' daughters
Memories of loved ones are passing me by
Memories of loved ones are passing me by
[Pre-Bridge: Brann Dailor]
Oceans of sand and rust
Give way and yield my wake
Oceans of sand and rust
Give way and yield my wake
[Bridge: Brann Dailor]
They're waiting inside
They're waiting to wash your eyes out
Their hands are alive
Alive with a fervent anger
Your feet have been tied and your tongue in your hand
Death of a thousand ravens
You're down on your knees
You're blind as the Ancient Kingdom
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro: Troy Sanders]
Relive the ages of the moon
Reeling the water close to you
