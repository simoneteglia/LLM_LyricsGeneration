You call for reasons
It turns me inside out
There's no direction
No ebb and flow
You call them rejects
They're all I have
The mills of life
They will grind you down
See the red
All I know is
See the red
Watch it flowing
I see a vision
Chew it with my teeth
Believe the dying
And minds that read
A change in season
Your mind crawls black
Turning neurotic
A self attack
See the red
All I know is
See the red
Watch it flow
The beast is vicious
Turns your pale face green
And keep the search on for mystery
You told a secret
Confide into the trees
Thinking you know a man's history
See the red
All I know is
See the red
Watch it flowing
Fall into pieces I swear we're done
You stick with me and prevail as one
Fall into pieces I swear we're done
You stick with me and prevail as one
