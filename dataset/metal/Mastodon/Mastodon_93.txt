[Verse]
If you can't get it
I can't get it
Fly, soul's single
Wind beneath us
I can't take it
You can't take it
Fly, soul is single
Wind beneath us
[Verse]
If you can't get it
I can't get it
Fly, soul's single
Wind beneath us
I can't take it
You can't take it
Fly, soul is single
Wind beneath us
[Outro]
Shades of 16
You're with me
Shades of 16
You're with me
Shades of 16
You're with me
Shades of 16
You're with me
