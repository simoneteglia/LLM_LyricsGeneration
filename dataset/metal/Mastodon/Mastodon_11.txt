[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
And the sky opened up and it swallowed us whole
All that's left is time and healing underground
Underneath us the cosmic dawn of war begins
We resolve and watch as it all crumbles down
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Beauty fades
Deaths decay
Fires on high
Reach the sky
Branches break
Roots remain
Strong in mind
Beauty
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Your adventure is dark and it hides beyond the cells
All I feel alive
, the hearts will prevail
The stolen eye was found and given to the lost soul
While the moon sets far and the milestones seem low
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Beauty fades
Deaths decay
Fires on high
Reach the sky
Branches break
Roots remain
Strong in mind
Beauty
[Bridge]
And all that I have come to lose
Gone so long it doesn't matter anyway
And all that I have come to gain
Will remain with me until the bitter end
And when you sit and picture me
Remember sitting in the sun and dancing in the rain
The end is not the end, you see
It's just the recognition of a memory
[Outro]
The eyes
The face
The lips
The tongue
The end
The end
[Guitar Solo]
