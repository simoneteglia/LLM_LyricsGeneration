[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
We trip the light
Firebird flies
Burn your inside
Given a lesson
The path I've shown
Follow all I know
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
It came from the ocean
Gift from the sea
Lava forms the stone
Belief in power
Believe the dream
Trust your own truth
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife
[Bridge: Scott Kelly]
You listen through the light
Tolling on the sea
Barren eyes behind you
Leave the shadows waking dreams
Rising through the door
Writing with a knife
Cut speech, cut light
Cut chord and break the dawning wretch of silence
[Verse 3: Troy Sanders]
Trust your own truth
Souls of the fallen
Death of the Godhead
Listen and breathe
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife
