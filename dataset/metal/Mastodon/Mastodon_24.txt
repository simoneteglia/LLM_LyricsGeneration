[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
Silent all your life
Running without vision
Hollowed out inside
Wronging all that's right
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
There's no cause to be alarmed
And no reason to escape from us
There's no illness and no pain
And no thought of any suffering
[Verse 3: Troy Sanders]
The road is long and bare
No clarity, no light
The moment came and swallowed us
Blinding all our sight
[Verse 4: Brent Hinds]
We will keep you free from harm
All you have to do is stand with us
I will mend your wounded heart
And restore the trust that you have lost
[Chorus: Troy Sanders, Brent Hinds]
Give your life
So I can breathe
Save our lives
It's all we need
[Verse 5: Brent Hinds]
We can lead you underground
And devour your humanity
Follow heat and follow sound
To the end of your insanity
[Chorus: Troy Sanders, Brent Hinds]
Give your life
So I can breathe
Save our lives
It's all we need
Give your life
So I can breathe
Save our lives
It's all we need
