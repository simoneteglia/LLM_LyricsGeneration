[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
I can see what the world has done to you
I can feel the weight, feel the weight
I can see what this life has handed you
I can feel the weight, feel the weight
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine
We won't let you slip away
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine
We won't let you leave this way
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
If you want, you can will it
You can have it
I can put it right there in your hands
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
I can hear what the spirits are telling you
I can clear the weight, clear the weight
I can see all the wolves as they circle you
I can crush the weight, crush the weight
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine
We won't let you slip away
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine
We won't let you leave this way
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
If you want, you can will it
You can have it
I can put it right there in your hands
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine
We won't let you slip away
This time, this time, things'll work out just fine
We won't let you leave this way
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
If you want, you can will it
You can have it
I can put it right there in your hands
