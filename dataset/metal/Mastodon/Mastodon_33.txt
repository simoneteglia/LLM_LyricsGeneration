Guide a truth
Prevail and ride
Into the black hole
Searching for crystal
Making the veins bleed
The source of consciousness alive
Crystalline resonance
Into the black hole
Searching for crystal
Making the veins bleed
A deep breath
Before the plunge
One million voices
Dispelling
A thousand faces
Disarming
Running through the darkness
Holding hearts in my eyes
Falling short of gauntlet
Covered in blood-sucking flies
[Closing: Scott Kelly]
The touch is cold
I tore a path screaming through wind and blood
I will it all
Burning deep in my skull
