[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the whale
Refusal of return
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Hollow eyes
Dry, pale legs
Howling on
Through fields and graves
[Verse 3: Brent Hinds]
Language of the sign
Symbols to our sight
Guardian to thy throne
Take on form
[Verse 4: Troy Sanders]
Daylight
Hide the skin
Cut it off
Scatter ash in the wind
[Bridge 1: Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds]
Shapeshifters rolling on winds of tyrants make
Fierce lore of fanged horn, danger all the way
Night's sea reflection, the faces of bodies slain
Return to form of natural human's fate
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge 2: Troy Sanders]
Grown from the cold
Spirits unclean
Dealer of the days
The ice will thaw
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge 3: Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds]
As the soldier walks through the crimson side
Researchers of aftermath
Dispelling disarming man
One-toed horses the subject of Genesis
And the immigrants
Fundamental side of a human mind
Hulder folk and fairies
So believe
[Outro]
The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the whale
Refusal of return
