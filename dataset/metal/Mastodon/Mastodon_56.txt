[Intro: T. rex roar from "Jurassic Park"]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Lesson
The honoring instinct of the animal
Pressure
No blame on the red bull
Throw fury at him
Aim, gorge and win
Less contenders on the way today
Let them pay
Nothing lost
Nothing gained
Suffer
Let them pay
Less contenders on the way today
Let them pay
Listen
Here lies the warning for matador
Blackout
Blood running the dirt floor
Won't bleed by accident
Burn your game plan
