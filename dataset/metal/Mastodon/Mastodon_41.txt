[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
As passion encircles the daily storm
The heart bleeds and droughts do not
[Chorus: Troy Sanders and Bill Kelliher]
Bone grave
Bone engraved
Stone grave
Stone engraved
Bone grave
Bone engraved
Stone grave
Stone engraved
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
All circles created with intention
An ocean turns yellow, it soothes the eye
[Chorus: Troy Sanders and Bill Kelliher]
Bone grave
Bone engraved
Stone grave
Stone engraved
Bone grave
Bone engraved
Stone grave
Stone engraved
