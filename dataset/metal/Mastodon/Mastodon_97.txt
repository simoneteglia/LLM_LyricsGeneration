[Verse 1]
Coals under foot
Burst into flames
Become the earth's
Ashes remain
[Chorus]
Awaiting sand
A burning man
[Verse 2]
Approach the door
Where I place blame
Take the first step
Cleansing my shame
[Chorus]
Awaiting sand
A burning man
[Verse 1]
Coals under foot
Burst into flames
Become the earth's
Ashes remain
[Chorus]
Awaiting sand
A burning man
[Verse 2]
Approach the door
Where I place blame
Take the first step
Cleansing my shame
[Chorus]
Awaiting sand
A burning man
