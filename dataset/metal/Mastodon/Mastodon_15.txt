[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
Diamond in the wishing well
Falling underneath the spell
Save me from the wicked ways
Pulling me with all its weight
High above the silver line
Flying over burning ground
Ringing bells with golden chains
Resonating with the sound
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
Siren sounded
I didn't hear it
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Travel deep within the mine
Never want to cross the line
Found the one I'd never sell
One I thought I'd never find
Searching through the layers of filth
Feeling where the light is from
Always licking off the bone
Carve a way to our home
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
Siren sounded
I didn't hear it
Voices warned
I'd not heed it
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
I fell into a pit of lies
I tried to dig around the other side
And much to my surprise
I was to blame for all the rain
I fell into a pit of lies
I tried to dig around the other side
And much to my surprise
I was to blame for all the rain
I was to blame for all the rain
