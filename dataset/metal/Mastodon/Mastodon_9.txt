Part I: Usurper
Don't stay, run away
He has ordered assassination
Don't stay, run away
The henchmen are gathered and waiting
Don't stay, run away
Your role as usurper is found out
Don't stay, run away
Czarina has warned of the danger
It's your own fault
This is what we wanted
It's your own fault
This is where we lay
Don't stay, run away
He has ordered assassination
Don't stay, run away
The henchmen are gathered and waiting
Don't stay, run away
Your role as usurper is found out
Don't stay, run away
Czarina has warned of the danger
It's your own fault
This is what we wanted
It's your own fault
This is where we lay
Part II: Escape
By the light of the moon
You must escape into the deep black of the night
Fight the devil inside
Enemies poison deep within my second sight
Wasting valuable time
Ride the tides of blood
Illumination
Beauties sudden hand
Shattered crown
Stretching arms up high
We're on our way now
Leave the Czar to die
By the light of the moon
You must escape into the deep black of the night
Fight the devil inside
Enemies poison deep within my second sight
Wasting valuable time
Ride the tides of blood
Illumination
Beauties sudden hand
Shattered crown
Stretching arms up high
We're on our way now
Leave the Czar to die
Part III: Martyr
[Instrumental]
Part IV: Spiral
Spiraling up through the crack in the sky
Leaving material world behind
I see your face in constellations
The martyr is ending his life for mine
Don't stay, run away
He has ordered assassination
Don't stay, run away
The henchmen are gathered and waiting
Don't stay, run away
Your role as usurper is found out
Don't stay, run away
Czarina has warned of the danger
It's your own fault
This is what we wanted
It's your own fault
This is where we lay
