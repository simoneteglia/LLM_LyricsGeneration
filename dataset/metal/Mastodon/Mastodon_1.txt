[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:59]
[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
I flew beyond the sun before it was time
Burning all the gold that held me inside my shell
Waiting for you to pull me back in
I almost had the world in my sight
[Pre-Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Lost love
,
bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you that I've failed?
Tell you I failed
[Chorus: Brent Hinds]
Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
I tried to burrow a hole into the ground
Breaking all the fingers and the nails from my hands
The eyes of a child see no wrong
Ignorant bliss, impending doom
[Pre-Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Lost love, bright eyes fading
Faster than stars falling
How can I tell you that I've failed?
Tell you I failed
[Chorus: Brent Hinds]
Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost
Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion
[Solo: Brent Hinds]
[Chorus: Brent Hinds]
Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost
Falling from grace 'cause I've been away too long
Leaving you behind with my lonesome song
Now I'm lost in oblivion
[Outro: Brent Hinds]
In oblivion
In oblivion
