[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
I cannot bare to believe that you have left this Earth
I couldn't stare as they covered you up with dirt and left
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
With all the best intent
And all your eloquence
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
The price we paid to know you
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Your smile is stretching from the stars
I am still standing here in solace
I sense the writhing
Peeling off your skin
As the coals burn
We'll walk on fire
[Pre-Chorus 1: Troy Sanders]
The lines you carved remain
Too many days to remember
Too many times have I tried
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
The price we paid to know you
The price we paid to know you
[Verse 3: Troy Sanders]
A dark shadow was cast with your departure
Now dig our way out from this mudslide and survive
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
With all the best intent
And all your eloquence
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
The price we paid to know you
[Verse 4: Troy Sanders]
Projecting light from beyond
We stare until the bruises soften
Never will there
Be another you
As the sun turns
We hold you tighter
[Pre-Chorus 2: Troy Sanders]
The final curtain calls
How many ways you brought pleasure
How many nights you brought to life
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
The price we paid to know you
The price we paid to know you
