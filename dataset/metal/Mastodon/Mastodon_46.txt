[Verse 1]
The temple of bodies
A building with souls
Given the cosmos
As we let go
As we let go
[Verse 2]
Locked in a dance
Surrounding the moon
This far from the clouds
Stargasm flows
Stargasm
[Verse 3]
Lead us by horses
On the way to our graves
Father the owl
It is your faith
It is your faith
[Verse 3]
Awake in the moment
Awaken the heart
Look to the spirits
Stargasm glows
Stargasm
[Chorus]
And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
[Verse 4]
Henged from the solstice
Bohemian grove
Flesh lies the altar
As we let go
As we let go
[Verse 5]
Glasses are empty
The owl has flown
Sever relation
Like you didn't know
Like you didn't know
[Chorus]
And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
