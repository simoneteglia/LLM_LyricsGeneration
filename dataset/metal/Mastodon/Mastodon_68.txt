[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
A thousand lights in the night
Alone in the spectrum
On this sand, I find
And realize
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
The light will guide you alone
I can position your way
You're gonna make it
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Enduring the tireless fight
Death in slow motion
I'm growing tired of this scene
Echoes in your past
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
The light will guide you alone
I can position your way
You're gonna make it
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna make it
You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The pеace we lost in ourselvеs are never found
You're gonna make it
[Guitar Solo: Kim Thayil]
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna make it
You had it all
Tomorrow's never fine
The peace we lost in ourselves are never found
You're gonna make it
