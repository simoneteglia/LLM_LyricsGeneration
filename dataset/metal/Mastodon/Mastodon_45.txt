Ice god shakes the earth
Destruction of the path
Sinking deeper in the snow
Eating bark with blackened hands
Swollen fingers, frozen jaw
Warm teeth wrapped around my wrist
Frostbite eating away at limbs
Slit the belly
Brontotherium
Climb toward
vermilion snowbank
fall
Station of the crosses, prayer save all
Chewing bone
Euphoria
Land and sky
Shining skull
[Chorus]
Ice field blanket land
Hunted beyond the fray
No direction known
Running with the bends
Provisions wearing thin
Avalanche sweeps the land
[Instrumental Break]
Starvation setting in
Spilling all that's left
Should've kept the fruits from virgin's vine
Three-horned face
Pillar of red
Evil lives atop my crooked spine
Rosebush current flow
Carmine river go
Solar storms erupt on the sun
Ice fields blanket land
Snow queen
Hypothermia
Ice lips
Hallucination
[Chorus]
Ice field blanket land
Hunted beyond the fray
No direction known
Running with the bends
Provisions wearing thin
Avalanche sweeps the land
[Instrumental Break]
Landscape ebb and flow
Think I felt the end of time
Skulls aglow as crystal shines
Starts to warm the empty climb
