[Verse 1]
Condition tomorrow
With visions inlaid
The priest stands to our right
A princess is mine
[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
[Verse 2]
The regress of some minds
Further chase the prize
Pretentious, you follow
Religion is mine
[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
[Bridge]
Anger precedes my footsteps
Haunting past comes into head
Horizon seems so far away
This life close to end of days
Kill and I will be damned
Forgive and I will be free
[Outro]
Unify the eyesight
Grow
