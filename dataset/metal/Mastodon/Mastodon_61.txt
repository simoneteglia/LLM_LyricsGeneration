[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
To tempt the fool into the mine
Let loose the snake with antidote
[Pre-Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
I see your face inside the smoke
It's hard to scream and nice to choke
[Pre-Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home
[Verse 3:  Brann Dailor]
Let's rest awhile inside the cave
Don't cry, you'll see that we'll be safe
[Pre-Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
Take your heart into your hand
Always
Take your heart into your hand
Always
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home
