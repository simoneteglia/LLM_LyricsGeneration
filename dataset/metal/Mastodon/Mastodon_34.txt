[Troy Sanders]
The elusive mystery
Determined by the stars
The stigma is valid, truth and fear
The fear is real
[Scott Kelly]
It will set us free
It took my Pa
I stand in deliverance
Waiting for destruction
In a wake of blood
[Troy Sanders]
The awakening moment arrives
Returning you at will
The midnight hour prepares for truth
The truth is real
The truth is real
[Scott Kelly]
It's so far beyond my reach
The crimson mask is rising black
The last setting sun
Will be seen in my dusted mind
Constantly burying our loves
In the trench of this
Mysterious despair
It leaves us empty
Clawing in
Clawing in
[Troy Sanders]
The elusive mystery
Determined by the stars
The stigma is valid truth and fear
The fear is real
[Scott Kelly]
Free us from this feeder
Lead me in deeper
To fulfil this seed that I grew
Into at my birth
