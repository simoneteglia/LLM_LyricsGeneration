I love your face and the things that you do
Make me warm sometimes when I'm away
I guess you'd say that at the end of the day
You'll be the only person here that exists
You left my heart in some cold dark place
Where your love grows on a vine and I see it all the time
I didn't mean a word that I said
When I was lying to your face about being alone
I've gone away forever
I've gone away
I've gone away forever
I've gone away
I reach out to touch you baby
You're not there
You reach out to hold my hand
Please don't you dare
'Cause I've gone away forever
I've gone away
I've gone away forever
I've gone away
I reach out to hug you baby
You're not around
You reach out to kiss my face
Please not right now
What can I say that hasn't been said before
One hundred times before you took the dog
And I wish I knew how to breathe again
I fear I'm gonna die inside my skin
This has gotta be the last time that we fight
Or go at each other's throats
Will you go, as I want to mend?
