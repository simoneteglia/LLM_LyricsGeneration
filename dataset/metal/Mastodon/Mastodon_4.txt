[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
I think that someone is trying to kill me
Infecting my blood and destroying my mind
No man of the flesh could ever stop me
The fight for this fish is a fight to the death
[Chorus]
White whale
Holy grail
White whale
Holy grail
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
What remorseless emperor commands me?
I no longer govern my soul
I am completely immersed in darkness
As I turn my body away from the sun
[Chorus]
White whale
Holy grail
White whale
Holy grail
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge: Neil Fallon]
Split your lungs with blood and thunder
When you see the white whale
Break your backs and crack your oars, men
If you wish to prevail
This ivory leg is what propels me
Harpoons thrust in the sky
Aim directly for his crooked brow
And look him straight in the eye
[Chorus]
White whale
Holy grail
White whale
Holy grail
