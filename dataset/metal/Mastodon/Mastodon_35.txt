[Verse]
Myth or legend
Nymph tale washed ashore
Near the kraken sleepeth stirs coral and bone
Infinite city
No sexy sneer
Hideous creation
Human and animal
Banter songs of rudeness to be adhered
Not on rocks that glisten
Harps to listen
Comb hair
Tear right to pieces
Left to recess a watery grave
[Bridge]
Sensing the blood of prey
Swimming in fear for life
[Chorus]
Rolling over, falling into jaws
Teeth that chatter, it distracts them all
The Fiji mermaid, she will let it know
Time is coming to feed and gnaw
[Chorus]
Rolling over, falling into jaws
Teeth that chatter, it distracts them all
The Fiji mermaid, she will let it know
Time is coming to feed and gnaw
