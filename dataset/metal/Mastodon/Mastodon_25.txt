[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
All the love I've shown
And given to the ones I've known
All the love I make
Is equal to the love I take
All the life I've known
And given to the life I've shown
Along the way
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now
Through fire embers' glow
Haunted, I lift the stone
Letting go, your spirit flies
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
All the love I've shown
Given to the ones I've known
All the love I make
Is equal to the love I take
Life is brief as
Be careful for what you ask
Along the way
[Chorus]
Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now
Through fire embers' glow
Haunted, I lift the stone
Letting go, your spirit flies
His thorns are on the road
His thorns are on the road
In the morning light
The sparrow flies
When the moon devours us
The planet dies
[Chorus]
Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now
Through fire embers' glow
Haunted, I lift the stone
Letting go, your spirit flies
