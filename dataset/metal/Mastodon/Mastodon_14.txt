[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
As we hang from the vine
We swam on the thin red line
I'm
asleep in the deep
Asleep in the dark black sea
I call out your name
All I hear is the pouring rain
When you came into view
I realize it's not you
[Pre-Chorus: Brann Dailor]
You disappeared into the steam
You disappeared into the steam
[Chorus: Brent Hinds]
'Cause I waited so long
Blue walsh is on me
'Cause I waited so long
Blue walsh is on me
When the wait is so long
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
The night fades away
I'm dipped in the deep dark clay
And I'm raising my voice
Sinking with all my teeth
I'm hiding the stone
The stone with the bright green glow
And I'm holding my knife
It's sure to make them leave
[Pre-Chorus: Brann Dailor]
You disappeared into the steam
You disappeared into the steam
[Chorus: Brent Hinds]
'Cause I waited so long
Blue walsh is on me
'Cause I waited so long
Blue walsh is on me
When the wait is so long
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
Time has caught up with me
Taking all my energy
Time has caught up with me
Taking all my energy
[Chorus: Brent Hinds]
'Cause I waited so long
Blue walsh is on me
'Cause I waited so long
Blue walsh is on me
When the wait is so long
