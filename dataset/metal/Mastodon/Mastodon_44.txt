[Verse 1]
I burned out my eyes
I cut off my tongue
I sealed them with all of the silver
And now I have none
[Chorus 1]
You killed the life
You took the diamond
You killed the vine
Death of the
[Verse 2]
You own the darkness
Have taken my sight
You buried the stars underground
You've stolen the night
[Bridge]
You can run to the sea
You can run to the forest
You can hide
But you'll never escape
[Breakdown]
You've run out of lies
You've run out of time
[Chorus 2]
You killed the life
You took the diamond
You killed the vine
Death of the sun
