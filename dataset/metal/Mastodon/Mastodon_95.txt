[Verse 1]
You take life
Give nothing back
You need to return what you've stolen
You need life
To multiply
Devour all that surrounds you
[Chorus]
Heavy weighs the crown
Low hangs the head who wears it
[Verse 2]
Destroyer
Of all that's good
We don't need a death that surrounds you
The bolt strikes
To infect
We know your intentions are impure
[Chorus]
Heavy weighs the crown
Low hangs the head who wears it
[Bridge]
Sickness can't kill this love
Always alive in my heart
Sickness can't kill this love
Always alive in my heart
[Chorus]
Heavy weighs the crown
Low hangs the head who wears it
