[Verse 1]
This forest
Is growing faster than I can tell
Cell structure
Eats away at a massive swell
Seems however
I'm a victim of circumstance
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hunt for
Ogres and Dwarves
Lion-slicer
[Chorus]
Run (run)
With (with)
Death
Run (run)
With (with)
Death
[Verse 2]
White faces
Coming closer with every step
Earth envelopes
Taking breath without happenstance
Carve my teeth out
Ripping through the sheep's head curse
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hunter
Gatherer
Ridden from the cave
[Chorus]
Run (run)
With (with)
Death
Run (run)
With (with)
Death
[Bridge]
Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taken everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now
[Chorus]
Run (run)
With (with)
Death
Run (run)
With (with)
Death
[Outro]
Gone away
My heart's gone away
Taken everything
My heart's gone away
Take it now
