[Verse 1]
I'm a man and that's who I am
And I'll tell you that to your face
I'm from the clouds and I shine like the moon
And I'm here to fuck up the place
Make it last, make it count
One more 'round and I'll see you outside
Heaven knows life can turn on a dime
So lets enjoy our time
[Chorus]
They have got me hanging upside down, again
Once more 'round the sun we go again
[Verse 2]
What's the meaning of life that we lead when
We're caught up in the race
My heart is spinning like a merry-go-round
And I want you to take a ride
I know it's rough and I know that you are weary
But its nice once you step inside
Roll me over and turn me around and lets make up on time
[Chorus]
They have got me hanging upside down, again
I just want to melt into the sun again
Once more 'round the sun we go again
[Chorus]
They have got me hanging upside down again
I just want to melt into the sun again
They have got me hanging upside down again
Once more 'round the sun we go again
