[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
Will there ever be a moment I won't feel this heat coming up from ground?
Will there ever be a time when I can show myself through open doors?
All I need is you to tell me how to reconcile this guilt and shame
I’ve already ripped myself to pieces and I've given it away
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
All the weight lies upon my shoulders from
The great disruption
It's hard to breathe inside these waves of doubt
Tidal distraction
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
Can you tell me how to wish away this chaos making my head spin?
Can you tell me how to soothe the savage beast locked up inside these walls?
Will there ever be a place that I can hide and heal these open sores?
Or do I have to cut them out and eat them as my people adore?
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
All the weight lies upon my shoulders from
The great disruption
It’s hard to breathe inside these waves of doubt
Tidal distraction
[Bridge: Troy Sanders
with Brann Dailor
]
I have, I have lost my way
Reaching, reaching for today
I have, I have lost my way
Reaching, reaching for today
[Outro: Brann Dailor]
Say when
And I'll come running back
Say when
And I'll come running back
Say when
And I'll come running back
Say when
And I'll come running back
