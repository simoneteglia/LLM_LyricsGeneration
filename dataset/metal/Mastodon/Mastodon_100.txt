Wake up!
That night haunts you like a vampire bite
Blood runs right down your face...
Cry harder, till you lose your place
Bite the bullet, get your gun
Do you feel safe now? Do you feel secure huh!?
What is that you say!?
With your false pretense, with your face rock hard...
Things fall right out of place...
Cape Town, where love wants us
Where they'll never find us hiding in the back of your car!!
Burn some rubber, burn the skin off our backs
Drive out of here as fast as you can!!
Pedal to the Metal!!!
Better get your facts straight...
LET'S GET LAID TONIGHT!!!
Never gonna settle, never gonna give you, give you what you want...
TALK YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS!!!
TALK YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS!!!
So tell me, where'd you get those pretty little eyes?
These!? Yeah! These!?
Tell me, where'd you get those pretty little eyes?
These!? Yeah! These!?
Tell me where'd you get those pretty little thighs...
These!? Yeah! These!?
Tell me where'd you get those pretty little thighs...
These!? Yeah! These!?
You make me look bad, it's just so sad!
I know those hands put me to bed
You make me look bad, it's just so sad!
I know those hands put me to bed
Tell me that you want me, tell me that you need me tonight!!
Didn't mean to make you cry, didn't want to see you die...
Tell me that you want me, tell me that you need me tonight!!
Didn't mean to make you cry, didn't want to see you die...
Tell me that you see me, tell me you wanna be me tonight!!
Didn't mean to make you cry, didn't mean to say goodbye...
Tell me that you see me, tell me you wanna be me tonight!!
Didn't mean to make you cry, didn't mean to say goodbye...
The docks held still time's hand with each wave!!!
The docks held still time's hand with each wave!!!
The docks held still time's hand with each wave!!!
The docks held still time's hand with each wave!!!
