I have seen this once before
I have felt these colors
I have known you for so long
When we ran in circles
For our sake
I will wait for you
I walk alone, into the darkness
I came toe to toe and face to face with the beast
He knew me by my name, it was surprising
And he knew everything about me that I despised
I have seen this once before
I have felt these colors
I have known you for so long
When we ran in circles
He had gold and he had silver
He had all the women and wine that you'd ever need
Just one thing, a prick of your finger
Spell your name in the sand and do it with your own blood
Bitten by the fangs of circumstance
Outward light a reflection
We are all equal
Underneath the slab of material
Mutable ways of my fortune
Bitten by my fangs
Gave me a smile, gave me a whisper
Lay me down in linens to watch me sleep
I played the fool
I played the sinner
I played the part of me that no one wanted to see
