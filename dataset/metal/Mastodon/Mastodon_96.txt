[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
The demon skin is covered in fine mist
Opened his hand in my hand
Holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
The space time paradigm
[Bridge: Brann Dailor and Brent Hinds]
Omnipresence
Primal instincts
[Hook: Brent Hinds & Troy Sanders]
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run
[Hook]
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
Letting me free the quintessence
In fine mist
Opened his hand in center
Holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
Losing my skin to the landslide
[Bridge]
Omnipresence
Primal instincts
[Hook]
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
[Chorus]
Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run
[Hook]
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
[Outro: Troy Sanders]
Shield failure
Speed farewell
Shield failure
Speed farewell
