[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
Angels dancing with a mortal, a sin
A giant born within a woman's womb
Nephilim walking through the forest, breaking limbs
As we bow and give respect to the gods
[Pre-Chorus: Brent Hinds]
Save yourself
Don't wait on me
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
My feet are sewn
Endless bottom
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
The church is burning from the inside out
Altars falling into ashes again
An eagle flies upon horizons with sight
Focusing on all our family and friends
[Bridge: Brent Hinds]
Apologize
Can we rise above it
Climb the line
It's a good endeavor
The ships arrived
Let's sail into the weather
Our crying eyes
[Pre-Chorus: Brent Hinds]
Save yourself
Don't wait on me
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
My feet are sewn
Endless bottom
