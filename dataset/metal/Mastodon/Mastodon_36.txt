[Intro]
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
Please excuse the madness
Of the situation I am in
Are we reunited?
For we both share the cause of this
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
You choose to apply logic
It's hard to ply where there is none
My destination's unknown
Allow the man to walk in his shoes from here
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes
[Verse 3: Troy Sanders]
Justifying all your control
I cease to mourn what never could be
No feeling's ever final
Just another scar I wear and hold dear
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
Falling down and losing ground
Save me from myself
All I've seen and all I know
I've not been this low
[Verse 5: Troy Sanders]
Now I stand up on my own
Learning from myself
Where I've been and where I'll go
Still remains unknown
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes
