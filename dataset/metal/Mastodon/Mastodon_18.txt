[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
When the Sultan gives orders to take your head
You must ride the winds to safety or you'll wind up dead
Through the evil and darkness you make your stand
Only skeletons of war will guide you by the hand
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Silence growing loud
Failure is not allowed
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
The battle that rages before my eyes
Is no different than the one that lives inside my head
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Silence growing loud
Failure is not allowed
Ancient Kingdom still remains
Crumble slowly
Ride beyond mortality
Leaving beauty now
[Bridge: Brent Hinds]
Falling rain sensing pain of mind
Falling rain sensing pain of mind
Pain of mind
Falling rain sensing pain of mind
Falling rain sensing pain of mind
Pain of mind
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Silence growing loud
Failure is not allowed
Ancient Kingdom still remains
Crumble slowly
Ride beyond mortality
Leaving beauty now
Sparks explode into the air
Live forever
Ageless sounds, they never die
And I will remain
