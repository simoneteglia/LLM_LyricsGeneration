[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
Oh, my dear
Look what we've done here
My greatest fear
A pain with an anchor
The taste of defeat
Oh, my dear
Look what we've come to
We've shattered serene
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I've turned the grief to medicine
Into my mouth will enter
The hardest pill I've ever had to swallow down
As karma whispers
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
Oh, my dear
The damage is done hеre
I disappear
A love with no anchor
In thе depths of the sea
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I've turned the grief to medicine
Into my mouth will enter
The hardest pill I've ever had to swallow down
As karma whispers
