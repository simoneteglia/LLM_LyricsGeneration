[Verse 1]
Through the ages, all the weary and the blind
Facing the unknown
Off the venom
Center our lives
Knowing not your own is unwise
And I will return for more
The light will lead you ashore
[Bridge]
Paralyzed by
Paralyzed by
Paralyzed by thorn inside
[Verse 2]
To the angel
Breathing on me from the right
A guilt you'll never know
From the devil
Staring from the left hand side
Souls to animal
Recede your eyes
Sulk in disgust
When there is doubt look to the obvious
And I'll decide what you will pay
Changing your mind seals our fate
[Bridge]
Paralyzed by
Paralyzed by
Paralyzed by thorn inside
Open your eyes
Take a deep breath and return to life
Wake up and fight
Fight for the love and the burning light
Open your eyes
Take a deep breath and return to life
Wake up and fight
Fight for the love and the burning light
