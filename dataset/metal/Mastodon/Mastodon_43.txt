Yeah
Float away
Known so low
You run away
Desolate us
Desolate all
No love is lost
You know we're weightless
Climb
Under my wing
Climb
Known so low
You run away
Desolate us
Desolate all
No love is lost
You know we're weightless
Climb
Under my wing
Climb
Known so low
You run away
Desolate us
Desolate all
No love is lost
You know we're weightless
Climb
Under my wing
Climb
Grown so slow
You run away
Desolate us
I'm sailing away
