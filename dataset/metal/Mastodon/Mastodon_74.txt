Slaved into brittle, worked for days
Only thing that paves your stay
Look behind you, see what you've made
Like a workhorse stands for miles
Work for you, never get tired
Roll 'em up, it's time to go
We'll be back before it's too long
Shaved into rhythm, work for days
Consequences, we have paid
To be free in a world we've made
Like a workhorse stands for miles
Work for you, never get tired
Roll 'em up, it's time to go
We can bet on all that's lost
Before it's too long
Burning hell
[?]
Slaved into brittle, make my way
Doesn't make it, clear the bay
I fought, run away
Look behind you, see what you've made
