[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
Bring forth the enemy
I want him to beg for his life
Bring forth the enemy
I want his neck on the knife
Incinerate the figurehead
Plan to erase you first
Flooding rain slathering
Bringing what you deserve
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Spirits warn that danger's coming
It's coming closer now
Pathways lit by fallen torches
Burn your insides out
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Find me the remedy
Searching the ends of the earth
Bring me the entity
Snuff out the light in his eyes
Eliminate, obliterate
The image in my sights
Bring me the head
Bring me the head
Finish and erase
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Spirits warn that danger's coming
It's coming closer now
Pathways lit by fallen torches
Burn your insides out
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
The whole world is a tragedy
Another crashing wave
Pinning you on the ground
Another living travesty
A never ending game
Fear is not easy to shake
[Bridge: Scott Kelly]
Free me
Bring me in
Heal my heart
Break my hands
What a lesson, God
Be in my heart
Be in my heart
And when I love anew
Let it be true
Let me shield
I need to leave the shadow
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
The whole world is a tragedy
Another crashing wave
Pinning you on the ground
[Outro: Troy Sanders]
Darkness takes you
Darkness takes you
Down
