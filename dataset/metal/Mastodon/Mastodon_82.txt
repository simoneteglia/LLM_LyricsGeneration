[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
Love your warm embrace
Hold me close, don't let me go
Nipple pink and cold
Filled up with mother's milk
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last
[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last
