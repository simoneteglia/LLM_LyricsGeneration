[Verse 1]
Running faster than I ever have
Evading sharks of the sky
Death trap and I kill again
Dig through my own hives
Shelter from sky
Talon of raptor
[Verse 2]
Force-fed glass giant moth
Reaping fields of the flesh
Heavy hand thwart the scheme
Of the dominant nymph
Omen she brings
Carried on weathered wings
[Bridge]
Fly, reptile
Leather wings
Bones hollow
Petrified
[Bridge]
Fly, reptile
Leather wings
Bones hollow
Petrified
[Verse 3]
Running faster than I ever have
Evading sharks of the sky
[Outro]
The earth's ashing floats
What's good for man
Cast us out
Into the known
