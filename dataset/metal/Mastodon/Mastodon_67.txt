[Verse 1: Scott Kelly]
Blessed visionary cut me with your sun
The rivers ran in blood
Spark fueled to fire
[Chorus 1: Brann Dailor and Troy Sanders]
Deep within this endless void
Searching for a sign
[Verse 2: Kelly]
The vessel forged inside of me
Watches over
Like the death of the moon
[Chorus 2: Dailor and Sanders]
Strike the shepherd, sheep will scatter
Mountains of despair
[Hook: Troy Sanders]
I can see the pain
It's written all over your face
[Verse 3: Kelly]
The screaming arrows tear through my soul
In the dawn your face is haunting
White ghostly dreams of old
[Chorus 3: Dailor and Sanders]
Weight of world is on your shoulder
Hear the voice of gold
[Hook: Sanders]
I can see the pain
It's written all over your face
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Violent soul under my control
Violent soul takes its final toll
Violent soul under my control
Violent soul takes its final toll
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 4: Dailor and Sanders]
Desperate heathens flock to sirens
Guard your heartache well
[Verse 4: Kelly]
Momma don't let them take her
Don't let them take her down
At least alone
[Chorus 5: Dailor and Sanders]
Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one
Her spirit's too strong
[Outro: Sanders]
I can see the pain
It's written all over your face
I can see the pain
You can make it all go away
