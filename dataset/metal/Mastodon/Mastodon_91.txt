[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
Another sinking stone
Finds its way down below
Resurface when only light will ever show
And while I progress slow
I'm soon to surpass you
Entitled to all possessions I have adored
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I feel pressure
I feel the pressure
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
And all the faded bones
Piling up high and low
Returning to life once you can stand alone
Don't get too close this time
The depths of love haunt you
It's dark inside where all my demons hide
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I feel pressure
I feel the pressure
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
Waiting with patience of eons
Your presence fades into a memory
Underneath a cloud of silence, you journey into the rift
Will time defy the weight of you leaving us?
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I feel pressure
I feel the pressure
[Outro: Troy Sanders]
Hold aggression
Hold aggression
