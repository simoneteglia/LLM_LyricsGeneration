[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
You reached two hands outward
Two birds spreading our wings
Today's arms turn numb
When I turn it inward
We live and breathe all your thousand words
Now you sleep, we'll finish your work
[Chorus: Troy Sanders &
Brann Dailor
]
To my detriment
To my detriment
To my detriment
(
I forge ahead unscarred
)
To my detriment
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
You painted us with effort
Always praising us high
The day has come to face the storm
As lightning strikes me in two
We live the dream onward as it were
Endless days we'll carry on as one
There's no doubt of what we're herе to do
You laid it out, a promise of yourself
[Chorus: Troy Sanders &
Brann Dailor
]
To my detrimеnt
To my detriment
(
I forge ahead unscarred
)
To my detriment
(
I forge ahead unscarred
)
To my detriment
[Chorus: Troy Sanders &
Brann Dailor
]
To my detriment
(
I forge ahead unscarred
)
To my detriment
(
I forge ahead unscarred
)
To my detriment
(
I forge ahead unscarred
)
To my detriment
