Don't talk, watch
Don't talk, watch
You came here, watch it
Don't like it? Walk out
We still have all your fucking money
Do not nudge, kick or jiggle the seat in front of you
I'm sitting there
I am everywhere at once
And I will cut you up
If you make out here
I will cut your lips and tongue
From your head with a
Linoleum knife
Do not explain the plot
If you don't understand
Then you should not be here
Your money is now our money
And we will spend it on drugs
Do not crinkle your food wrappers loudly
Be considerate to others
Or I will bite your torso
And give you a disease
Did you bring your baby?
Babies don't watch this
Take the seed outside
Leave it in the streets
Run over it after the show
If I see you videotaping this movie
Satan will rain down your throat with hot acid
And dissolve your testicles
And turn your guts into snakes
This is a copyrighted movie for Time Warner
If I find you've sold it on eBay
I will break into your house
And tear your wife in half
