[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
It never ends
The game isn't done
I feel the crawling and haunting upon us until you listen
It never ends
Enough is enough
Taking your essence and use it to strengthen their own flesh and blood
[Chorus: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Time watching as the sand flows through glass
Light calls to me from future and from past
This kills me to know
We cannot learn
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
It never ends
The ink isn't dry
The Great Consolation has written a second lease on your life
The Great Consolation has granted a second lease on your life
[Chorus: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Light watching as the sand flows through glass
Time calls to me from future and from past
This kills me to know
We cannot learn
[Bridge: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Time watching as the sand flows through glass
(Time is moving as sand's flowing)
Light calls to me from future and from past
(Light is blinding, radiating)
[Refrain: Troy Sanders]
It never ends, it never ends, it never ends
[Outro: Kevin Sharp]
Chronic illusions confusing conclusions
Foster the culture, predict the deception
Chronic delusions with caustic solutions
