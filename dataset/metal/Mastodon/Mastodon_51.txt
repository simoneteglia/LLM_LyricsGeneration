[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
I wish I could run forever
Not concerned if I am found
I wish I had all the answers
I wish I knew what went wrong
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Whatever you say is too late
Speak it before you run
Waiting is just a mistake
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
I just need you to whisper
Tell me all is well
You deserve to be happy
Not stuck knee deep in hell
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Whatever you say is too late
Speak it before you run
Waiting is just a mistake
It pains me to see you this way
To erase you is what I fear
You're swimming through my head, it keeps you near
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
But all we said was too late
Still, you intend to run
Chasing another mistakе
It pains me to see you this way
To erase you is what I fеar
You're swimming through my head
It keeps you near
[Outro: Brann Dailor]
My love, so strong
Washing the dirt away
As the snakes all go to their holes
My love, so strong
Bathing in turpentine
Until the flesh and bone come undone
My love, so strong
Deflecting the thoughts of strangers
To reach the other side
My love, so strong
The mountains we made in the distance
Those will stay with us
