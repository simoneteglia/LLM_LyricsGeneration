[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
All eyes forward
See what's to be done
Calloused as I am becoming
Less and less of my own
If I burn the bridges
Leaving the ash behind
There's no choice but to move on
Within a heartbeat the dream is dead
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
All that I have sacrificed is leaving me and letting go now
I don't want to leave you here alone among the wind and weeping
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
Circles I've broken
Once, they seemed so clear
Leaving the past I buriеd
Deep in yesteryear
This will bring back mеmories
That I don't want anymore
Always see reminders
And now I close the door
The illusion is gone, the end is here
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
All that I have sacrificed is leaving me and letting go now
I don't want to leave you here alone among the wind and weeping
If I could crawl beneath the earth and settle with the worms and dirt
I'd steal the eyes of serpents soothing powers from the deep blue sea
[Outro: Troy Sanders]
Is this just our fortune or unexpected fate?
A betterment for all
The trials we made are troubling, they smother me
Lay me bare to dry
Begging me to call it quits and go for broke
Bury me as I fall
To treat you as a part of me, it hollows you
The story has to fold
