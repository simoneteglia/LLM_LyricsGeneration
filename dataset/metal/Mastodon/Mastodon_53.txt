[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
I don't see the fearsome fright
All I see is beauty shine
Not much time to say goodnight
I can hear you scream in the sky
Nephew do you feel all right
Always up in overdrive
They would try to smother you
Never let your feelings through
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Where you go, you wonder if you live out loud
Where you go, you wonder if you live out loud
Where you go, you wonder if you live out loud
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
I'm sniffing your garden
I'm sniffing your rose
She's stuck in the middle
You know how it goes
They're crawling across now
They'll give him some blow
We'll do him a favor
We'll give him some gold
[Verse 3: Brann Dailor]
I remember your eyes came out
I can see you run and shout
Don't know where to place the blame
You knew how to hide your pain
We just want to see you alive
Taught me how to speak my mind
Release you in atmosphere
It was just too small in here
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Where you go, you wonder if you live out loud
Where you go, you wonder if you live out loud
Where you go, you wonder if you live out loud
[Bridge: Brent Hinds]
Live out loud now
We don't live in silence when we live out loud now
We live on the journey
You go with them
[Outro: The Coathangers]
Hey! Ho! Let's fucking go
Hey! Ho! Let's get up and rock n' roll
