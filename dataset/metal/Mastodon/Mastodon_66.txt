Change, stand, grow
These things you'll never be
Taste your fate
All that you'll ever be
A life, love unconditional
A life love, love unconditional
Chase
Chase 'em down, string 'em up
Hate
Hate the ones who bring you down
Chase
Chase 'em down, string 'em up
Hate
Hate the ones who bring you down
Chase
Chase 'em down, string 'em up
Hate
Hate the ones who bring you down
