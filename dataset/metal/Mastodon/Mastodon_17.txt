[Verse 1: Brent Hinds & Brann Dailor]
I killed a man cause he killed my goat
I put my hands around his throat
He tried to reason with the sky and the clouds
But it didn't matter, cause they can't hear a sound
[Pre-Chorus: Brent Hinds, Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
[Chorus: Brent Hinds, Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds & Brann Dailor]
Splinters in my skin just like needles and pins
I cut through the pine, love the feeling it gives
Been out here for days, runnin' through these trees
I'm using my hands, cuttin' through the disease
[Pre-Chorus: Brent Hinds, Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
[Chorus: Brent Hinds, Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
I feed the powerless
Chew it up, spit the rest
I feed the powerless
Chew it up, spit the rest
[Chorus: Brent Hinds, Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl
[Outro: Brent Hinds, Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
