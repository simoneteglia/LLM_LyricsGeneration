[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
Earth has burst
Mountain flames
Moon beheld
Father snake
Mind control
Has left its nest
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Shame on
[Verse 2: Brent]
Bulls roar loud
The fearless fall
Wooden vessel
Broken wings
Caught my killer
In my grave
[Chorus: Troy]
Shame on
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3: Brent]
Eyes of grace
Kill again
Trapped in maze
Trembling fear
Head-scorched brow
Perish the land
[Chorus: Troy]
Shame on
[Bridge: All]
Burn! Burn!
Burn! Burn!
[Bridge: Troy]
A vast, calm wilderness
The call to adventure comes
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro: Troy]
Lead and land atop this rock
Infinite path carved with unrivaled skill
