[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
Running outside the Nazca Lines
You know I see you all in white
Hoping you'll grow the fruitful vines
And the rain to give us life
[Solo: Brent Hinds]
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
Violence born within my mind
I know it always takes its time
Climbing inside the cosmic eye
And forgive the enemy
[Chorus: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself
[Verse 3: Brann Dailor]
Watching you crumble to the ground
Made me want to run away
Helping you find the golden crown
Made it easier to stay
[Chorus: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself
[Bridge: Brent Hinds]
At the bottom of the mountain
Unaware of my surroundings
Separation from my spirit
Let the trees fall where they may
[Chorus: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
I wonder who I am
Reflections offer nothing
I wonder where I stand
I'm afraid of myself
