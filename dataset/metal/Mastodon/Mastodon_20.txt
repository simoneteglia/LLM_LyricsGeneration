[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
I hope the sun shows the way
Don't crush my spirit today
Reveal your precious stones
So I can help myself
[Chorus: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Don't waste your time
Don't let it slip away from you
Don't waste your time
If it's the last thing that you do
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
I dig through bone and skull
Imagine black emerald
I'm covered head to toe
With diamonds in the rough
[Chorus: Brann Dailor & Troy Sanders]
Don't waste your time
Don't let it slip away from you
Don't waste your time
If it's the last thing that you do
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Brent Hinds]
These snakes have nothing to say
I want their heads right away
I sharpen every blade
And I give them all to you
Yeah, I give them all to you
You're in my head
You're in my head again
