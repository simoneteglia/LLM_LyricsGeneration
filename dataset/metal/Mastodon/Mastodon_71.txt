No one
Sees the difference
In the land
Where sky meets Earth
Form horizons
Hand of stone
Arm of strength
Nature's fire
Fist of gold
Venom
Stains the lips and burns the tongue
With vengeance and hatred
Extremities
Forged in nature's fire
Unrelenting vigor
Carve the future
Feast or famine
Drink deception
The wells run dry
The need for temptation
Falling through brain field
Head for divide
The hand matches
The hand that leads the way
To kill the shepherd
Just to see his face
Heed the warning
Ingest the rotten bone
The hand that falters
The hand that turns to stone
Chew
On the root that gives us sight
Cranium shatters
Feed
The needles as they fall
The truth, the mask, brain divided
