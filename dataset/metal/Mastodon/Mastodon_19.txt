[Verse 1: Troy Sanders]
You let the wind take us down
You let the storm come and wipe us out
I saw the fog snuff you out
I saw the ocean come take you under
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
I had my boot stuck in your mouth
I had you screaming for your last breath, yeah
I shoved a moth deep inside
Patiently waiting for deep devour
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below
[Verse 2: Troy Sanders]
You are the one who nobody likes
You are the plague that was brought here by rats
I'd like to hunt you, that's a fact
Watching you fade out and never come back
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below you
You take the high road down
I'll take the ground below
