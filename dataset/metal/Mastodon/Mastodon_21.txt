[Verse 1: Brent Hinds]
It's gone away
It's gone away
It's gone for good
Animal spirits come calling me home
Through the tunnels of brilliant light
The magnet of wisdom is pulling
Burrowing faster the fabric of time
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space
[Verse 2: Brent Hinds]
Rapid descendants
The wormhole is empty
The center of Khlysty surrounds me
The fire is dancing in a silvery sheet of breath
Black robe
Necromancing
Summon the soul of the spectre
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Fire in the eye
Realm of mystic majesty
[Bridge: Troy Sanders]
No escape
Binding spirits
No escape
Trapped in time space
[Chorus: Troy Sanders]
Fire in the eye
Realm of mystic majesty
