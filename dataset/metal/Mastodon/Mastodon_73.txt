[Verse 1]
Lift you up again
Give you to the trees
All sound and visions are
What they ask of me
Let's run fast through the fields
Over mountaintops
Let's swim through ocean water
And we'll never stop
[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when
[Verse 2]
Can you show me
Where to find the stream?
I've been told before
That the water's clean
Will you come with me?
Two of us can drink
Move quick, we've got to hurry
There's no time to think
[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when
[Bridge]
We didn't come this far
Just to turn around
We didn't come this far
Just to run away
Just ahead
We will hear the sound
The sound that gives us
A brand new day
[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when
