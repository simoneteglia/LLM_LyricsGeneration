[Verse 1: Brann Dailor]
Head down, running from the beast
Breakneck speed taking all my breath
Black feet scrapped and scarred and dripping blood
Rain come down, take me with your flood
[Pre-Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I came to and I was running from you
Feel your breath on the back of my neck
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Where have I come to be?
Is this all that's left for me?
[Bridge: Brann Dailor]
I wish that I was still there
I want to keep on breathing
[Verse 2: Brann Dailor]
Bulls roar loud, snakes move past my feet
No teeth, no hands, set me free
Bones start rattling 'round inside my head
I don't know if I'm alive or dead
[Pre-Chorus: Troy Sanders]
I came to and I was running from you
Feel your breath on the back of my neck
[Chorus: Brann Dailor]
Where have I come to be?
Is this all that's left for me?
[Bridge: Brann Dailor]
I wish that I was still there
I want to keep on breathing
[Verse 3: Brann Dailor]
Dig deep, kicking up rock and dirt and sand
Out of this lifeless valley, bones in hand
Over these mountains to the seas of life
Leave this desert for the sick and damned
