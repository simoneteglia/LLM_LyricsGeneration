Life's changed, yet remain the same
Basking in an afterglow
I did not know
I am here in shadows island
Lying, hopeless wondering
All questions exhaust me
Life's changed, yet remain the same
Basking in an afterglow I did not know
I am here in shadows island
Lying, hopeless wondering
All questions exhaust me
Running, screaming, chanting
For all this land, I've seen its worth
Helping all for time's sake
It brings me work,
pinned to this world
Running, screaming, chanting
For all this land, I've seen its worth
Helping all for time's sake
It brings me work, pinned to this world
