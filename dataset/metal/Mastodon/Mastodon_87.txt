[Spoken Intro]
I'm talking about my life
I can't seem to get that through to you
I'm not just talking about one person, I'm talking about everybody
I'm talking about form, I'm talking about content
I'm talking about inter-relationships
I'm talking about God, the Devil, Hell, Heaven
Do you understand?
