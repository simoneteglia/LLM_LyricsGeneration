[Verse 1]
Taken down
With hearts alive
Our hearts alive
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Lurking dark underground
Descend to bottom
Swim below eternally
Into the deep blue sea
[Chorus]
Time and space all alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes, opening up
I can't stand, I can't breathe
[Verse 2]
Rolled fin out
Oil stripped
Hold is filled
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean coil, water boils
He swims to the surface
Flame from mouth, smoke he breathes
Enter the caverns of the deep
[Chorus]
Time and space all alone
It can be a lonely place
There it goes, open up
I can't stand, I can't breathe
[Verse 3]
Terrified, ghastly cry
Spiraled lives
Taken down, taken down
[Bridge]
The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
Not for defeat
[Bridge]
The iron side
Bucket of lead
Battle is she
