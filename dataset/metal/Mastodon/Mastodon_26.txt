The moment you walked in the room my friend
The demons, they all went away
Be careful they're only asleep for a while
Pretending there's nothing to say
Throw salt in all the corners here
Make sure you watch him leave
Build up the walls around this house
And dig out the rot in the floor
Block out the entrance with brick and stone
And mortar that's made from coal
Crawl into this hole I've made
Transform these feelings of fear
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
Loose lips have fallen on deaf ears
Loose lips have fallen on blind eyes
An ocean of sorrow surrounds this home
I hope that we make it to shore
As time chips away at the fortress walls
It seems that we weathered the storm
The sun begins to show itself
Revealing victory
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
Loose lips have fallen on deaf ears
Loose lips have fallen on blind eyes
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire
Say you'll remember her voice
And I can't get you out of my mind
