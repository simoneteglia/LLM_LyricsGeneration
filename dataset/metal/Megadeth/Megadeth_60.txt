[Verse 1]
Uneasy feeling, burning out my eyes
I hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods on Judgement Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave
[Pre-Chorus]
One last look at visions of flesh
The last best hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone
[Chorus]
(Elysian fields)
We are storming the heavens
(Elysian fields)
To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian fields)
We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian fields)
To the
Elysian fields
[Verse 2]
Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief, one decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms is like cancer to their bones
[Pre-Chorus]
One last look at visions of flesh
The last blessed hope of man on earth
Pontius Pilate still washin' his hands
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone
[Chorus]
(Elysian fields)
We are storming the heavens
(Elysian fields)
To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian fields)
We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian fields)
To the
Elysian fields
[Harmonica Solo: Jimmie Wood]
[Chorus]
(Elysian fields)
We are storming the heavens
(Elysian fields)
To raise the swords and shields
(Elysian fields)
We ascend to our destiny
(Elysian fields)
To the
Elysian fields
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Outro]
(Elysian fields)
We are storming the heavens
(We are storming the heavens)
(Elysian fields)
To raise the swords and shields
(To raise the swords and shields)
(Elysian fields)
We ascend to our destiny
(We ascend to our destiny)
(Elysian fields)
To the
Elysian fields
