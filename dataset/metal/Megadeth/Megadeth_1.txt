[Part I: Holy Wars]
[Verse 1]
Brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me, who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs "do you kill on God's command?"
A country that's divided, surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homeland
Holy wars...
[Part II: The Punishment Due]
[Intro]
Upon my podium as the “know-it-all” scholar
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Upon my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the “holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger” of God
[Verse 2]
Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me, some people live to destroy me
Either way, they die... they die!
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Verse 3]
They killed my wife and my baby, with hopes to enslave me
First mistake... last mistake!
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake... no more mistakes!
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Verse 4]
Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it, don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings, mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
[Outro]
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
