[Verse 1]
There's a secret place I like to go
Everyone is there but their face don't show
If you get inside, you can't get out
"There's no coming back.", I hear them shout
[Verse 2]
Welcome to my hideaway, my secret place
How I arrived, I can't explain
You're welcome, too, if you wanna stay
But everyone just runs away
[Verse 1]
There's a secret place I like to go
Everyone is there but their face don't show
If you get inside, you can't get out
"There's no coming back.", I hear them shout
[Verse 3]
Let me in, get me out
Can't do more than twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
Found it again in my secret place
Let me in, get me out
Can't do more than twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
In disgrace
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
I hide from those that try to find me
Scary things that's right behind me
I lost myself, I must confess
I can't explain how I got this mess
[Verse 2]
Welcome to my hideaway, my secret place
How I arrived, I can't explain
You're welcome, too, if you wanna stay
But everyone just runs away
[Outro]
My secret place (there's a secret place)
My secret place (there's a secret place, I like to go)
My secret place (there's a secret place)
Just runs away, my secret place
