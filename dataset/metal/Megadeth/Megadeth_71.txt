[Intro]
Psychotron...
[Verse 1]
Assassin in stealth, assailant from Hell
Impervious to damage
Computer on-board, engaged in a war
Non-stop combatant
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?
[Chorus]
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
[Verse 2]
Burning inside, godspeed in glide
Battle plan running
A killing machine, just downright mean
And forever cunning
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?
[Chorus]
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Verse 3]
Target to destroy, arms in employ
Full assault fire threat
Sensors indicate you will terminate
Life systems disconnect
[Chorus]
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg
Part
bionic
and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Outro]
Psychotron
Psychotron
Psychotron
Psychotron...
