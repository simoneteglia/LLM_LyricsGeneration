[Verse 1]
You keep sayin' you got somethin' for me
Somethin' you call love, but I call sex
You've been kissin' when you ought-a-be screwin'
And now someone else can kiss your ass
[Chorus]
These boots are made for walkin', and that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
You been lyin' and there ain't no believin'
And you keep sayin' what you want in the bed
You been stayin' when you ought-a-be-a leavin'
And what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet
[Chorus]
These boots are made for walkin', that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
You keep dressin' ways you shouldn't be dressin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned, ha!
I just found me a brand-new box spring mattress
What? You know, bitch, you got a lot to learn
[Chorus]
These boots are made for walkin', and that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna stomp all over you
Yeah!
[Bridge]
Are you ready, boots?
Are you ready, boots?
Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin'
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
And you think I'm kiddin', don'tcha?
