[Intro]
Come here, closer
[Verse 1]
Who do you
Who do you think you are?
Some kind of super star?
We'll see
Where do you?
Where do you think you are?
That shit won't get you far
With me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're just so dashing
You marvel at the sound
Of your own voice, as you crash into the ground
[Chorus]
You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes
[Post-Chorus]
Just so you know
That's how it goes
[Verse 2]
You're bad
You're bad for my health
Because you make me sick
You prick
Don't you know?
Don't you know who I am?
You know I'd like your face
To kick
[Pre-Chorus 2]
If your lips are moving I know you must be lying
You even suck the life out of dying
[Chorus]
You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes
[Bridge]
The house of cards are falling
Luck is running thin
Father forgive him, being a punk is not a sin
[Chorus]
You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes
[Outro]
You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
And everybody knows
Except you
