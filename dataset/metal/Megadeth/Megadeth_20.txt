[Verse 1]
A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies
A little man with a big eraser, changing history
Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees
Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue
Make a person disappear, and no one will ever miss you
[Verse 2]
Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws
Follow the instructions of the New Way's Evil Book of Rules
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools
[Bridge]
You said you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway?
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?
Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come
And I believe my kingdom will come
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Young]
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Chorus]
F is for fighting, R is for red
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E, we elect them, E, we eject them
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
D for your dying, O, your overture
M, they will cover your grave with manure
This spells out 'FREEDOM', it means nothing to me
As long as there's our P.M.R.C
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Young]
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Chorus]
F is for fighting, R is for red
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E, we elect them, E, we eject them
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
D for your dying, O, your overture
M is for money, you know what that cures
This spells out 'FREEDOM', it means nothing to me
As long as there's our P.M.R.C
[Chorus]
F is for fighting, R is for red
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E, we elect them, E, we eject them
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
D for your dying, O, your overture
M, they will cover your grave with manure
This spells out 'FREEDOM', it means nothing to me
As long as there's our P.M.R.C
[Bridge]
Put your hand right up my shirt
Pull the strings that make me work
Jaws will part, words fall out
Like a fish with hook in mouth
[Verse 2]
Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws
Follow the instructions of the New Way's Evil Book of Rules
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools
[Outro]
I'm not a fish, I'm a man
Hook in mouth!
