[Intro]
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
[Verse 1]
Back when I was just seventeen
I thought that I knew everything
I could make it in this scene
To be a rising star that only gleamed
But all the answers disagreed
With the questions held for me
[Verse 2]
I was legal now at twenty-one
I knew the way the world should run
My God, just look what I had done
Simply drunk and having fun
Looked for friends, but I found none
All alone at twenty-one
[Chorus]
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
[Verse 3]
At twenty-five I was surprised
That I was even half-alive
Somehow I managed to survive
I felt my body doing time
And in my back a hundred knives
From my friends at twenty-five
[Verse 4]
And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell
I'd buy your life, if you would sell
A year or two if less compelled
So live your life and live it well
There's not much left of me to tell
I just got back up each time I fell
[Chorus]
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
The fire burns on and on
That drives me on until all is gone
Except the simple plans
Of mice and men
