[Verse 1]
I'm lonely and abandoned
Washed up, left for dead
I'm lost inside the desert
Of every word you said
Like a nuclear reactor, or TNT
I'm thinking 'bout the times
When you lied to me
All the innuendo
Caught up on your hook
I was just a name
In your little black book (Oh)
In your little black book...
[Chorus]
I'll get even with you
I'll get even with you, even with you
[Verse 2]
I'm bitter and I'm twisted
I haven't slept in days
I'm lonely and I'm angry
I can't make it go away
I'm like a bomb that's ticking
I got voices in my head
I got a doll with needles
And wishing you were dead
I'll get you back somehow
That's what I'm gonna do
I'll get you back somehow
Your nightmare coming true (Oh)
It's coming true (Oh)
[Chorus]
I'll get even with you
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do
(I'm gonna get even with you)
I'll get even with you
Even with you, even with you
[Verse 3]
You better look behind you
'Cause there I'm going to be
I'll be standing in the shadows
With who I used to be
He's slightly schizophrenic
Me, and me, and me, and me agree
That you are gonna pay
For what you did to me
[Chorus]
I'll get even with you
I'll get even with you
[Outro]
I'll get even with you
(I'm gonna get even with you)
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, gonna)
I'll get even with you, even with you (Gonna get even)
Ah, that's what I'm gonna do
(I'm gonna, I'm gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna)
I'll get even with you
(I'm gonna get even with you)
I'll get even with you...
