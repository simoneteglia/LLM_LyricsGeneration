[Verse 1]
Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned...
[Chorus]
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
[Verse 2]
Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars' anagram is "lairs"
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous...
[Chorus]
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
[Interlude]
"One hour from now, another species of life form will disappear off the face of the planet... forever, and the rate is accelerating"
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
