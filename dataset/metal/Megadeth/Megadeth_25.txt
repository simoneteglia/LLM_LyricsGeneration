[Verse 1]
I had wrists donning slits, flowing constantly
My broken body in a wreck and wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit-and-run, the finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter, take a look and see
[Chorus]
No escaping pain, you belong to me
Clinging on to life by the skin of my teeth
No escaping pain, you belong to me
Clinging on to life by the skin of my teeth
[Verse 2]
My blood flows through the streets, deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills on the dresser in my room
My wet-brained neighbor cranes his neck to see
In time, the white light's, a train bearing down on me
[Chorus]
No escaping pain, you belong to me
Clinging on to life by the skin of my teeth
No escaping pain, you belong to me
Clinging on to life by the skin of my teeth
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I won't feel the hurt, I'm not trash any longer
That, that doesn't kill me only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue, that's what 9-1-1 is for
So tag my toe and don't forget, ooh, to close the drawer
[Chorus]
No escaping pain, you belong to me
Clinging on to life by the skin of my teeth
No escaping pain, you belong to me
Clinging on to life by the skin of my teeth
