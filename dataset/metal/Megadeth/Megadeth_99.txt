[Verse 1]
For this I was chosen, because I fear nothing
With confidence I tread through the dead of the night
Off to another war-torn, faraway battlefield
Wherein lies a daemonic enemy horde
On this day, I decide to anoint my fists
Engaging them in the mode of power and war
Stopping at nothing that's short of fulfilling my destiny
Willing to die and I will after you for what I believe
[Verse 2]
A desperate avenger striking fear in their hearts
Invading their dreams before the day even starts
[Pre-Chorus]
Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow, I may lay down and die
But not this day
[Verse 3]
Sent on an unholy quest
To reduce all those who resist
To the size of their shriveled up souls
And scatter them like grist
I vanquished the strangleholds that the netherworld sets for me
The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies
[Verse 4]
Bathed in blood up to the horse's bridle
It's death to retreat, there's no chance of survival
[Pre-Chorus]
Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow, I may lay down and die
But not this day
[Chorus]
This day we fight!
This day we fight!
This day we fight!
[Bridge]
Strip the fallen heroes
Finish off the wounded
Collect the spoils of war
And send them back dead
[Outro]
This day we fight
This day we fight
Fight, fight
This day we fight
Fight, fight, fight
This day, I fight!
