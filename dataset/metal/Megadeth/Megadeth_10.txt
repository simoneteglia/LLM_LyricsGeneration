[Instrumental intro]
[Verse 1 / Guitar Solos: Marty Friedman]
Bestow upon me knowledge
Wizard
, all-knowing, all-wise
I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze, now defiled
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin
Parade the grey-robed monks
The vestal virgins wheel the wyvern's in
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Bridge]
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protégé of five magics
Give me alchemy, give me wizardry
Give me sorcery, thermatology
Electricity,
magic if you please
Master all of these, bring him to his knees
[Chorus]
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
[Verse 2]
Possessed with Hellish torment
(Possessed with Hellish torment)
I master magics "five"
(I master magics "five")
Hunting the abyss lord
(Hunting the abyss lord)
Only one will stay alive
(Only one will stay alive)
He who lives by the sword
(He who lives by the sword)
Will surely also die
(Will surely also die)
He who lives in sin
(He who lives in sin)
Will surely live the lie
[Instrumental Break]
