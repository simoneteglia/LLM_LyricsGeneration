[Verse 1]
You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For death surely awaits you
With sharp and pointy teeth
[Verse 2]
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen ones
[Verse 3]
Human bones blanket the dirt
Of the heathen's lair
That we must pass this den of death
The only path from here
[Verse 4]
But I walk in the light
The time to die has come
No one shall take my life
I'm of the chosen ones
[Verse 5]
Black shadows fill the sky
As the creature's eyes grow near
Raise the shield
Of the holy pilgrim high into the air
[Verse 6]
Heaven's powers fill my arms
Onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh, the beast is coming
To put you to the test
[Guitar Solo]
Look out!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Now this land is mine to pillage
Rape and steal and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign; for now, I stay
I stay to kill!
[Bass Solo]
[Verse 1]
You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For death surely awaits you
With sharp and pointy teeth
[Verse 2]
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen ones
