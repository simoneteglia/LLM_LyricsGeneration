[Intro]
Right now!
[Verse 1]
I am an Anti-Christ
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want, but I know how get it
I want to destroy, possibly?
[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
No dog's body
[Verse 2]
Anarchy for the USA
It's coming sometime, and maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light
Your future dream is a shopping spree
[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Verse 3]
Of many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the NME
I use anarchy
[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Steve Jones]
[Verse 4]
Is this the MPLA?
Is this the UDA?
Is this the IRA?
I thought it was the USA
Or just another country
And other cunt-like tendencies
[Outro / Guitar Solos: Jeff Young]
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
You know what I mean?
'Cause I want to be an anarchist
Again, I'm pissed
Destroy!
