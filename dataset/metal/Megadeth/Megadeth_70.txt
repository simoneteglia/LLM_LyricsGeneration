[Intro]
"It's alive!"
[Verse 1]
I will give you life
You'll serve only me
And my will to kill
You will kill for me
[Verse 2]
All that I desire
All that I command
You are here for me
I'm your master
[Guitar Solo]
My creation
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I will make for you
A soulmate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name
[Verse 4]
She will be your bride
She will serve me too
I will introduce to you
The bride, bride of Frankenstein
