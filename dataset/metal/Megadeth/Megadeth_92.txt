[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
His Wicked Highness
Born from disaster
To dominate and to kill
A glistening, murder-machine
False majesty standing perfectly still
A blitzkrieg raining down evil
On a mountain of black ice
Like a good old fashioned
Beating within inches of your life
[Chorus]
While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from above
[Verse 2]
Once frozen like a prisoner depraved
Perched high atop the lithospheres
Set free from beneath the depths of Hell
Bequeathing man nothing but despair
The beast is genetically programmed
Time to destroy, time to go berserk
To see the end of all wars
To see the end of the earth
[Verse 3]
Stopping at nothing, punch-drunk
From the blood that he's tasted
Tearing your soul apart
Not one bit of your pain will be wasted
Now death descends upon you like a bloody white dove
Bringing your retribution
Your sudden death from above
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from above
