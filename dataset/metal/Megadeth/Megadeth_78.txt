[Verse 1]
Well I ain't superstitious
When a black cat crosses my path
And I ain't superstitious
As I break the looking glass
Ain't afraid of no demons
Don't make me laugh, ha-ha
But I ain't superstitious
Under the ladder I go
And I ain't superstitious
It's all bullshit, don't you know?
Ain't afraid of no shadows
I like the dark anyway
And that's a fact, ha!
[Chorus]
Superstitious
Superstitious
[Verse 2]
And I ain't superstitious
No such thing as bad luck
And I ain't superstitious
I couldn't really give a fuck
Take your stupid superstitions
Find some other paranoidal, chickenshit
Sissy, worm and tell it to him
[Chorus]
Superstitious
Superstitious
[Bridge]
Oh, I ain't superstitious
Oh, I ain't superstitious
[Outro]
That's right, one more time
Come on, shut your mouth
Listen up
Hey, it's my turn
