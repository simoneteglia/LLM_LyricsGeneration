[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's a reason why things go like they do
Somewhere there's a reason why some things just fall through
We don't always see them for what they really are
But I know there's a reason, just can't see it from this far
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
[Chorus]
I thought I knew it all (I thought I knew it all)
I thought I had it made (I thought I had it made)
How could it end this way? (How could it end this way?)
I thought I knew, I thought I knew
[Verse 2]
Somewhere there's a reason why things don't go my way
Somewhere there's a reason that I cannot explain
Just like the change of seasons, just may not be my turn
But I know there's a reason, the lesson's mine to learn
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
[Chorus]
I thought I knew it all (I thought I knew it all)
I thought I had it made (I thought I had it made)
How could it end this way? (How could it end this way?)
I thought I knew, I thought I knew
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Chorus]
I thought I knew it all (I thought I knew it all)
I thought I had it made (I thought I had it made)
How could it end this way? (How could it end this way?)
I thought I knew, I thought I knew
[Post-Chorus]
I thought I knew
[Outro]
Thought I, thought I, thought I, thought I
Thought I, thought I, thought I, thought I knew it all
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine & Marty Friedman]
