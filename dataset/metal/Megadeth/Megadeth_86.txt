[Verse 1]
It was springtime
The minutes simply drifting away
Then everything stopped in the world
[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Fallout) Radioactive clouds
(Fallout) Hides the exclusion zone
(Fallout) And you were nowhere to be found
[Chorus]
I see your face wherever I turn
There's blood on my lips as my eyes start to burn
You vanished and left me behind
Like one of the dogs of Chernobyl
Where did you go?
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Nuclear winter is here
Reactor four's still belching clouds
Thеre's no one left to hеar a sound
[Pre-Chorus 2]
(On and on, fallout) On and on, I keep searching for you
(But I know, fallout)
I know you're never coming back
(Not for me, fallout) Not for me, or for anyone, anywhere, anyway
[Chorus]
I see your face wherever I turn
There's blood on my lips as my eyes start to burn
You vanished and left me behind
Like one of the dogs of Chernobyl
Where did you go?
I see your face wherever I turn
My hair's falling out as my skin starts to burn
You vanished and left me behind
Like one of the dogs of Chernobyl
Where did you go?
[Verse 3]
Vault breach, too close is dead, massive exposure
I must escape and navigate this concrete enclosure
No warning and no pain, only shock and then dread
No one coming, no one going, I'm alive with the dead
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Nausea overwhelms my brain,
distance is the goal
Stomach spasms, leaking gut,
I have lost all control
Saliva gurgling,
I'm retching,
till I overwhelm the bowl
I ask God in repentance, "Do you still want my soul?"
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 5]
Bodies strewn everywhere, no need for cremation
Daylight coming into view, I sense there's no salvation
Stagger out into the open, my eyes fixed and staring
Armed patrol, red lights on, the sirens are a' blaring
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 6]
I am the walking dead,
and I'm taken into safety
They ask the time of death because
my skin's looking pasty
Transfusions, test tubes,
and clinical eyeing
Purulence and decay, my deathly complying
[Outro]
Blankets of smoke, orifices bleed
Bloating bellies, and legs getting weak
Cerebral swelling,
organs liquifying
Acute radiation, this is how they die
This is how they die
This is how they die
