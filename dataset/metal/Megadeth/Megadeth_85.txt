[Intro]
"Attention! Attention!
All citizens are ordered to report to their district detention centers!
Do not return to your homes, do not contact anyone!
Do not use any cellular or GPS devices!
Surrender all weapons at once!
Attention! This way to the camps!"
[Verse 1]
I woke up in a black FEMA box
Darkness was all around me (In my coffin)
My dreams are all nightmares anymore
And this is what I dream every night
[Verse 2]
The Leader of the
New World Order
The President of the United States
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A
Without the RFID chip, you're just an illegal alien
An enemy combatant of America
Welcome to the
New World Order
[Chorus]
This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the
[Verse 3]
A society in a society, inside the fence life as you know it stops
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die
The clock is ticking so slowly
And so much can happen in an hour
[Chorus]
This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the endgame
[Verse 4]
I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned
I had to bleed, inside the day yard
A system of controlled movement like a giant ant farm
Any time is long time
Now you're not in charge of your time anymore
[Chorus]
This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the end
[Verse 5]
The Ex-President signed
A secret bill that can land a legal US Citizen in jail
And the patriot act stripped away our constitutional rights
They say a Concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!
[Verse 6]
Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat
By the tyranny of Mind control for the mark of the beast
All rights removed, you're punished, captured, and enslaved
Believe me when I say, "This is the endgame"
