[Verse 1]
Who'd believe with the way things are here?
We'd be goin' anywhere, telling people how to live
Who'd believe we'd spend more shippin' drugs and guns
Than to educate our sons? Sorry, but that's what they did
[Refrain]
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Oh, I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me
[Verse 2]
Luck deserted me, and the truth beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their selves to higher things
I've stepped over lots of bodies on my way
Thanks for the information, don't need no more anything
[Refrain]
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Oh, I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me
[Chorus]
We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for
youthanasia
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Chorus]
We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for
youthanasia
[Outro]
We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We run for
youthanasia
