[Verse 1]
Do it if you dare, leaping from the sky
Hurling through the air, exhilarating high
See the Earth below, soon to make a crater
Blue sky, black death, I'm off to meet my maker
[Chorus]
Ooh, energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high-speed dirt, ah
[Verse 2]
Paralyzed with fear, feel velocity gain
Entering a near catatonic state
Pressure of the sound roaring through my head
Crash into the ground, oh damned if I'll be dead
[Chorus]
Ooh, energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high-speed dirt
[Post-Chorus]
Jump or die!
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Verse 3]
Dropping all my weight, going down full throttle
The pale horse
awaits like a
genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins, faster as I go
Oh I forgot my name, I'm a dirt torpedo
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Bridge]
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Outro]
Shit!
