[Verse 1]
No one knows what draws the moth to the flame
And nothing costs as much as playing the game
[Pre-Chorus 1]
She had to know, know, know he'd give love for sex
He had to know, know, know she'd give sex for love
[Chorus 1]
The taste, touching his tongue, sweet to his lips
Poison, now penetrating deeper
Betrayed by just one bite, for just one night
To find forbidden fruit tastes sweeter
[Verse 2]
Just like pressing a loaded gun to your head
One knows only the spider can navigate its web
[Pre-Chorus 2]
She had to know, know, know he'd get what he wants
He had to know, know, know she'd get what she needs
[Chorus 2]
Soon under the spell, emotions are high
Mind control penetrating deeper
The hex was cast on him, all he believes
Now is forbidden fruit tastes sweeter
[Pre-Chorus 3]
She had to know, know, know he'd win at the start
He had to know, know, know she'd win in the end
[Chorus 3]
His one last thought blew his mind, bullet to the brain
Hot lead was penetrating deeper
Just one reckless shot squeezed from the hand
That knows forbidden fruit tastes sweeter
