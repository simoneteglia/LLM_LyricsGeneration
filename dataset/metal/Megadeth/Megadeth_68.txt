[Intro]
"Pull over, shithead, this is the cops!"
[Verse 1]
Full tank, pockets lined with cash
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass
Drive all day, and through the night
Romance the road, winding left to right
[Pre-Chorus]
The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free
A feeling inside me and the whole world to see
[Chorus]
Driving fast makes me feel good
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do
Driving the interstate, I'm stopped for a 502
[Guitar Solo: Jeff Young]
[Verse 2]
Oh, hundreds of miles rolled off today
Signs lose their meaning, minutes tick away
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol
[Pre-Chorus]
Drive until daybreak, always on the go
Life on the freeway, night shift 'til dawn patrol
[Chorus]
Driving fast makes me feel good
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do
Driving the interstate, I'm stopped for a 502
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Stopped for a 502
Next time it's gonna be you!
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Outro]
Stars above guide me
This feeling inside me
I drive until daybreak
Life on the freeway is Hell
Is the Hell...
I'm coming through...
