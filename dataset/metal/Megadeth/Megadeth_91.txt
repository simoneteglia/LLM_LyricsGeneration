[Verse 1]
Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
Oh I had no idea what it cost
My life flashed before my eyes
When I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied
[Pre-Chorus]
So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all...
[Chorus]
À tout le monde
À tous mes amis
Je vous aime
Je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free...
[Verse 2]
If my heart
(If my heart)
Were still alive
(were still alive)
I know it would surely break
And my memory's left with you
(And my memory's left with you)
There's nothing more to say
[Pre-Chorus]
Moving on, is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
When the living are scarred
[Chorus]
À tout le monde
À tous mes amis
Je vous aime
Je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free...
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
So as you read this, know my friend
I'd love to stay with you all
(you all)
Please smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone, that's all
(it's all...
oh...
)
[Chorus]
À tout le monde
(à tout le monde)
À tous mes amis
(à tous mes amis)
Je vous aime
(je vous aime)
Je dois partir
(je dois partir)
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free...
[Chorus]
À tout le monde
(à tout le monde)
À tous mes amis
(à tous mes amis)
Je vous aime
(je vous aime)
Je dois partir
(je dois partir)
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free...
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
