[Intro]
Within striking distance from Ground Zero
Sits a smoldering international cauldron
The United Abominations as it were
Born to prevent wars, it froze in the face of disaster
And stood silent while terrorization took hostage of the world
In a mire of hypocrisy
The U.N. ignores sex crimes by its own blue helmets
And enables terrorism, so in the end it's failed
And the U.N. is where our so-called friends
Get to stab us in the back
And we pay 22% of their tab to host our enemies here at home
Ambassadors from countries, otherwise known as a catastrophe
Enjoy diplomatic immunity living in Manhattan
While their children are turned into prostitutes
It's a complete and utter disgrace, a blot on the face of humanity
And they get away with it
[Verse 1]
Poverty in their kitchens
Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full off the fat of their lands
There's no blood on their hands,
(right Kojo?)
They promised to tell the truth
Without leaving a fingerprint
They will lose the U.N. one way or another
The victim, I fear will be us, sisters and brothers
[Pre-Chorus]
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more un
Than you are right now, the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
[Chorus]
Don't tell me the truth
I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations
[Verse 2]
A grave and gathering danger
The decision to attack based on secret intelligence
It'll take years, I fear
To undo the failings in Iraq,
(Iran and Korea)
You may bury the bodies
But you can't bury the crimes
Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms
No, not me, not when death lasts forever
[Pre-Chorus]
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more un
Than you are right now, the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
[Chorus]
Don't tell me the truth
I don't like what they've done
It's payback time...
[Spoken]
"The U.N. writes resolution after resolution and has become irrelevant through inaction and totalitarian paralysis,"
"Order, Order!!!"
"Ha! There is no such thing as order"
"Larry, it's true, reports confirm today that the United Nations has officially closed its doors forever,"
"Well, I just don't see what all the fuss is, because they don't do anything anyway, do they?"
[Pre-Chorus]
The U.N. is right; you can't be any more un
Than you are right now, the U.N. is undone
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun
The threat is real, the Locust King has come
[Chorus]
Don't tell me the truth
I don't like what they've done
It's payback time at the United Abominations
[Outro]
NATO invaded Yugoslavia to end ethnic cleansing
There was no U.N.‌‍
The U.S. invaded Afghanistan after 9/11
There was no U.N.‌‍
Saddam Hussein violated 17 U.N. resolutions
The U.N. was asked to join the War in Iraq. The U.S. invaded
There was no U.N.‌‍
Libya bombed a discotheque in Berlin killing Americans
There was no U.N.‌‍
Iran funds Hamas and attacked the U.S. in the seventies
There was no stinking U.N.‌‍
Facing War without end, looking into the future
There. Was. No. More. U.N.‌
