[Verse 1]
It was just another day
It was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right
[Pre-Chorus]
There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can't do
[Chorus]
Lying on your bed examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch, I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
[Post-Chorus]
Hey, this was my life!
Hey, this was my fate!
[Verse 2]
This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin
[Pre-Chorus]
Now there's motives for the suspect
Now there's nothing left to say
And now there's method to the madness
And now there's society to pay
[Chorus]
Lying on your bed examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch, I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
[Post-Chorus]
Hey, this was my life!
Hey, this was my fate!
[Bridge]
In our life there's "if"
In our beliefs there's "lie"
In our business there's "s-s-sin"
In our bodies there's "die"
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
This was my life
This was my fate
This was my life
This was my fate
