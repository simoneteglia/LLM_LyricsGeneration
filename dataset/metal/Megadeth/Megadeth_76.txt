[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think that I'm insane because I'm frowning all the time
[Verse 2]
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
[Chorus]
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel so love to me is so unreal
[Verse 5]
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
It's too late
Too late
[Outro]
"Nick... Nick? Nick!"
"Fuck me running!"
