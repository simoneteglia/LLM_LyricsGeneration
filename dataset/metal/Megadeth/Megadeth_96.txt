[Verse 1]
The heat is raging from the rising fires of war
Embers of avarice soon begin to soar
Vengeance breeding greater vengeance
Two eyes for one eye
Crowning burning hatred thatâ€™s lying deep inside
A token gift, destroyers deep within its hold
Revenge of patient men is sweet and best served cold
The enemy inside the belly of the beast
A mighty Trojan horse, tonight the sentries sleep
[Chorus]
On the march, no place to run
The time has come, nowhere to hide
The moon is red, no one is safe
From spilling blood, no living thing survives
Here they fight, regretting nothing
Here you die, the walls are caving in
Nothing left, a lethal encounter
It's judgment time, when death comes from within
[Verse 2]
Warning signs ignored
They have all but been denied
Prophets and messengers, mocked and vilified
Final destination lying deep inside their court
Their first line of defense soon became their last resort
Hardened deceivers entered through their open gates
Silent trained assassins, lying still, in wait
[Chorus]
On the march,
no place to run
The time has come, nowhere to hide
The moon is red, no one is safe
From spilling blood
, no living thing survives
Here they fight, regretting nothing
Here you die, the walls are caving in
Nothing left, a lethal encounter
It's judgment time, when death comes from within
[Chorus]
On the march, no place to run
The time has come, nowhere to hide
The moon is red, no one is safe
From spilling blood, no living thing survives
Here they fight, regretting nothing
Here you die, the walls are caving in
Nothing left, a lethal encounter
It's judgment time, when death comes from within
[Chorus]
On the march, no place to run
The time has come, nowhere to hide
The moon is red, no one is safe
From spilling blood, no living thing survives
Here they fight, regretting nothing
Here you die, the walls are caving in
Nothing left, a lethal encounter
It's judgment time, when death comes from within
[Outro]
Death from within, death from within
Death from within, death from within
Death from within, death from within
Death from within, death from within
