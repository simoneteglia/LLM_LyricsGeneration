[Verse 1]
Born from the dark in the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below, deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep, aw!
[Chorus]
Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression
[Guitar Solo]
[Post-Chorus]
Praise your architecture of aggression, ah, huh!
[Verse 2]
Ensuing power vacuum, a toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire and the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss - the other, genocide
Time to pay with your ass, a worldwide suicide
[Chorus]
Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression
[Interlude]
"Fight for America"
"Fight for America"
"Fight for America"
"Fight for America"
"Fight for America"
"Fight for America"
"
Everybody knew that the 15th
Of January was the deadline date
By kicking the war off, once the war was over
People would be able to go home.

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Born from the dark in the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below, deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep
[Chorus]
Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression
Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies...
Praise your architecture of aggression
[Outro]
"They looked like big long snakes
("Fight for America")
Coming up in the air"
"Medium sized triple a, um, just
("Fight for America")
Ah tracer bullets"
"They looked like big long snakes
("Fight for America")
Coming up in the air"
"Fight for America"
