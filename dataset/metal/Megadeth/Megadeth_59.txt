[Verse 1]
Lost inside the system, locked away without a key
No one will ever miss a menace to society
A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite
A touchy hair-pin trigger and such a wasted life
[Verse 2]
Trying to break the mold of a broken family
Fight against your failure and living on his knees
Guilty of a crime of non-conformity
A hanging judge and jury handing down the penalty
A lethal injection, now they watch the body jerk
Exterminate the problem, except it didn't work
[Verse 3]
No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn't there
Coroner never checked because he didnâ€™t
fucking
care
Passing off the body, they all believed he died
Starting up the hearse, set out for a final drive
Like whistling past a graveyard when walking by at night
It's a fatal illusion to think that evil ever dies
[Verse 4]
In a darkened mortuary reeking of formaldehyde
Aroused from deadly slumber, something opened up his eyes
[Verse 5]
Spilling of their blood was a promise that he'd keep
Hate so strong revived him from a deep necrotic sleep
[Verse 6]
Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed
He grabbed a knife and set out on a vivisection spree
[Verse 7]
A butcher hell bent, massacring each one with his blade
From the first one to the last, he dispatched them to the grave
[Outro]
It's a fatal illusion
It's a fatal illusion
Evil never dies
It never dies
