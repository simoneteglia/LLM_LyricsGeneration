[Intro]
Whoa!
Whoa!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Mean and infectious, the evil prophets rise
Dance of the Macabre
, as witches streak the sky
Decadent worship of black magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon trapped without a plea, oh
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Seething in agony, necrosis is the fate
Pins stickin' through the skin, the venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory, nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life, no one hears a sound
Help me!
[Verse 3]
Prepare the patient's scalp to peel away
Metal caps his ears, he'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor riveted across his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries
[Chorus]
The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath
[Verse 4]
Now you're drawn and quartered, your bones will make the 'X'
Symbol stands for poison and it's chained to your head
And as we fold your arms to make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix; religion has been lost
[Chorus]
The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
The skull beneath the skin
