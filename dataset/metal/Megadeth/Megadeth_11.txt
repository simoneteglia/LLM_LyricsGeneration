[Verse 1]
Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car
[Pre-Chorus]
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you
[Chorus]
Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
We were shifting gears hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end, you know it feels too slow
[Pre-Chorus]
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you
[Chorus]
Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
I'm giving you my room service
And you know it's more than enough
Oh, one more time, you know I'm in love
[Pre-Chorus]
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you
[Chorus]
Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
; fuck yeah!
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!
Huh!
[Guitar Solo]
Hahahahaha!
[Outro]
Yeah!
