[Verse 1]
My life is everything
That feeds my thirst, that causes sin
My wants are all I care
No shame and guilt, there's nothing there
Look deep into my face
I sell deceit without a trace
Fear not what I can do
Unless you want it done to you
[Chorus 1]
As I climb onto your back I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion
[Verse 2]
My self, I'm centered in
There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own
Look deep into my soul
It's black as coal like a bullet hole
Fear not, get off your knees
There's no defense, you'll do what I please
[Chorus 1]
As I climb onto your back I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion
[Chorus 2]
As I climb onto your back I will promise not to sting
I will tell you what you want to hear and not mean anything
I will treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
'Cause you knew all along I am the scorpion
[Verse 3]
My lies to reach the shore
I aggrandize and nothing more
My hopes to steal away
All that you love I'll soon betray
Look deep into my past
The pain I feel is unsurpassed
I'm not a lowly scorpion
I'm so much worse, I'm the fall of man
