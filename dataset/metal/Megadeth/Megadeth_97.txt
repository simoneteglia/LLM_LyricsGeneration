[Verse 1]
Public enemy number one
Jailbreak and a smoking gun
You won't believe the things I've done
And the killing is just for fun
Public enemy number one
A stolen car and I'm on the run
Through the night till the rising sun
And the trouble has just begun
[Pre-Chorus]
Roses on your grave, I'll be on my way
There's no time to stay with the enemies I've made
[Chorus]
I'm invincible
You might say despicable
Punishment's reciprocal
Public enemy number one
I'm unbeatable
My mind is untreatable
Crimes unrepeatable
Public enemy number one
[Verse 2]
Public enemy number one
Watch the authorities come undone
With every stand-off that I've won
Flirting death just for fun
Public enemy number one
Born a fugitive father's son
Another heist of a bank is done
And the trouble has just begun
[Pre-Chorus]
Roses on your grave, I'll be on my way
There's no time to stay with the enemies I've made
[Chorus]
I'm invincible
You might say despicable
Punishment's reciprocal
Public enemy number one
I'm unbeatable
My mind is untreatable
Crimes unrepeatable
Public enemy number one
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
The posters say I'm wanted "dead or dead"
Anyone who's tried got a bullet to the head
[Chorus]
I'm invincible
You might say despicable
Punishment's reciprocal
Public enemy number one
I'm unbeatable
My mind is untreatable
Crimes unrepeatable
Public enemy number one
[Outro]
Public enemy
Public enemy
Public enemy
Public enemy
