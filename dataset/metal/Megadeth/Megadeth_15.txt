[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Lost in a dream, nothing's what it seems
Searching my head for the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes as we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays of you walking away
[Chorus]
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
[Verse 2]
Time and again she repeats "Let's be friends."
I smile and say "Yes"
Another truth bends, I must confess
I try to let go, but I know we'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again (I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust
[Chorus]
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God, help me please, on my knees (On my knees)
Betrayed by lust (By lust)
We lied to each other so much (So much)
Now there's nothing we trust
[Interlude]
"How could this be happening to me?"
"I'm lying when I say 'Trust me'."
"I can't believe this is true..."
"Trust hurts."
"Why does trust equal suffering?"
[Interlude]
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Chorus]
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God, help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much (So much)
Now there's nothing we trust
[Outro]
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much (We lied to each other so much)
That there's nothing we trust
God, help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust (Lust)
We lied to each other so much
Absolutely nothing we trust
