[Verse 1]
If I see the morning hours
I'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
Because I've burned out my today
If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
I've got a terminal future
And it's time to write my will
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I downed another glass of courage
And a shot of Thorazine
[Chorus]
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
[Verse 2]
Got a short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave
I've got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind
[Pre-Chorus 2]
In a black tie and straightjacket
Man, I'm going to try again
[Chorus]
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Nevermind the tree
[Verse 3]
There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays, they only die
There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Taunting rigor mortis
I feel it draw me in
[Chorus]
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
We're not ready
We're not ready
We're not ready
99, 9, 9
