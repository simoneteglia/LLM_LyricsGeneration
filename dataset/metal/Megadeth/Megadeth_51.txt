[Verse 1]
We see each other through different eyes
Segregating ourselves by class and size
It's me against you in everything that they do
This planet's become one big spinning disaster
[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next
[Chorus]
What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?‌
[Verse 2]
When you walk away from that which makes you strong
You only fool yourself, you only weaken your cause
There's creeping hate if you resist the false narrative
Crushing all the dissenters who still think for themselves
[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next‌
[Chorus]
What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?
[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next, no, no!
[Chorus]
What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?
