[Intro]
The mother of all that is evil
Her lips are poisonous venom
Wicked temptress knows how to please
Priestess roars, "Get down on your knees"
[Verse 1]
The rite of the praying mantis
Kiss the bones of the enchantress
Spellbound, searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight
The fight
[Chorus]
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf
[Verse 2]
My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heartbeat than my own
The sound of claws on cobblestone
I'm stoned
[Chorus]
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf
One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf
[Verse 3]
Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her mystic lips tell only lies
Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her hidden will to kill in disguise
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
