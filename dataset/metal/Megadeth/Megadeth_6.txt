[Verse 1]
In my hour of need
Ha, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold
Very cold, no one cares for me
Did you ever think I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think to stop thinking?
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too
[Bridge]
Things will be better (Better, better)
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you, I'm probably wrong
[Verse 2]
But, oh, how I lived my life for you
'Til you turned away
Now, as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years, I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head
Raise your face, your eyes, tell me who you think you are
[Bridge]
I walk, I walk alone
To the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way
[Guitar Solo: Dave Mustaine]
[Verse 3]
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone, I call to ease the pain, yearning to be held by you, alone
So alone, I'm lost, consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain; won't you hold me again?
You just laughed, ha-ha, bitch
Whole life is work built on the past, time has come
When all things shall pass, this good thing passed away
