Part I: Never Walk Alone
[Verse 1]
Hiding in any doorway, in any shadow
Any place where danger waits to kill my time
There is one who loves and waits to seal your fate
As sure as you live and die
Live and die, live and die
[Chorus]
When you feel that something's wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it won't be long
Time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy, it once was me
[Verse 2]
Let me wrap my arms all around you
Suffer the trespasses that you've made
I will drink your pain away
Forever and a day
If you just call out my name
If you just call, call my name
If you just call, even whisper it
[Chorus]
When you feel that something's wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it won't be long
It's time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy, it once was me
Part II: A Call to Arms
[Instrumental Bridge]
Part I: Never Walk Alone
[Chorus]
When you feel that something's wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it won't be long
It's time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy, it once was me
[Chorus]
When you feel that something's wrong
I'll shelter you and keep you warm
I'll never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and it won't be long
Time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy, it once was me
