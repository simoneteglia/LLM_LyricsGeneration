[Verse 1]
I lied just a little
When I said "I need you"
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest, almost...
[Chorus]
Living alone, can't stand this place
It's four in the morning and I still see your face
[Verse 2]
I was nearly pure
When I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest, almost...
[Chorus]
Living alone, falling from grace
I want to atone, but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks
[Bridge]
I question your call by the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up, but I don't have a choice
It happened that night when you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Living alone, falling from grace
I want to atone, but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks
[Outro]
Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest
Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest
Almost, almost honest
Almost, I was almost honest...
