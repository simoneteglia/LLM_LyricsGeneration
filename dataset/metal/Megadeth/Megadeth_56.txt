[Intro]
Well, here I come
[Verse 1]
Stand up and plant your feet
Listen; I'm letting off steam
Now throw your hands in the air
Let it loose, I don't fuckin' care
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
Rattlehead!
[Verse 2]
A dose of Metal you need
To bang your head 'til you bleed
It's time for snapping some necks
Slashing, thrashing to Megadeth
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
Rattlehead!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
You; your head, is pounding with pain
You shake loose parts of your brain
Winning, sinning, beginning
Feeding the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing
Frying; annihilating you, ha-ha-ha-ha
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
There's someone back in the shadows
You feel, though you can't see his eyes
He'll bash your head if you cross him
Ain't quite your average guy
Don't wear no leather to fit in
Don't wear no spikes to be cool
Don't want no woman beside him
Just make it fast, loud, and rude
[Refrain]
Rattlehead!
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
I'm a Rattlehead!
Rattle your goddamn head
