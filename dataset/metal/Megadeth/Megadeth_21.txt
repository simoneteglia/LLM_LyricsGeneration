[Verse]
I sneak in my own house
It's four in the morning
I've had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys
I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her
I'll wake up dead
[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solos 00:27-02:26]
[Bridge]
Ooh, I wonder, will she find out
About the other, other lover, Diana?
[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solo 02:38-03:22]
[Outro]
Wake up dead (
You die
)
Wake up dead (And buried)
Wake up dead (
You die
)
Wake up dead
