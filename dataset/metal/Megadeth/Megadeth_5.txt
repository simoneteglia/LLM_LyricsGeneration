[Verse 1]
What do you mean I "don't believe in God?"
I talk to Him every day
What do you mean I "don't support your system?"
I go to court when I have to
What do you mean I "can't get to work on time?"
Got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean I "don't pay my bills?"
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh?
[Refrain]
If there's a new way
Oh, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time
[Verse 2]
What do you mean I "hurt your feelings?"
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean I "ain't kind?"
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean I "couldn't be the president
Of the United States of America?"
Tell me something
It's still "we the people", right?
[Refrain]
If there's a new way
Oh, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time
[Instrumental Break]
Oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
Can you put a price on peace?
[Pre-Chorus]
Peace, peace sells
Peace, peace sells!
[Chorus]
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
[Outro]
No, no-no-no-no
Peace sells
(Peace sells)
Peace sells!
Argh!
