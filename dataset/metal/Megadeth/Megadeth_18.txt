[Part I: Good Mourning]
[Guitar Solo]
[Intro]
Good mourning
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Hey, I don't feel so good
Something's not right
Something's coming over me
What the fuck is this?
Whoa!
[Guitar Solo]
[Part II: Black Friday]
[Verse 2]
Killer, intruder, a homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
[Chorus]
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgenous slaughter's my evil deed
[Verse 3]
My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads
Deviant defilers, you're next to be dead
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent
Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head
Yeah!
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces, 'til no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
The remains of the flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend
Bloodbath's my way of gettin' clean
[Bridge]
I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill
Oh, I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down
I see you, and I'm waiting for Black Friday
[Guitar Solo]
Turn me loose!
[Verse 5]
Killer, intruder, a homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
[Chorus]
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgenous slaughter's my evil deed
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
[Outro]
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the Devil on the
Devil on the, Devil on the wall
