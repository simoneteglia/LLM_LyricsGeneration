[Verse 1]
Walking stiff, let me tell ya'
Better left for dead
And now we are on a mission
Well, it's full speed ahead
My legions, when we do the crime
Let's get one thing straight
To get there early is on time
And showing up on time is late
[Pre-Chorus]
Ladies and gents, we're still alive
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time
Angel in our pocket, Devil by our side
We ain't going nowhere, 'cause heroes never die
[Chorus]
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die
[Verse 2]
We've been run down every hill
Chased up all the dead-end streets
But if you try to cut us out
You'll get a kick in the teeth
[Pre-Chorus]
Ladies and gents, we're still alive
By the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time
Fasten up your head belts, it's time to ride the skies
It's time to be immortal, 'cause heroes never die
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Marty Friedman]
[Chorus]
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, they never die
[Bridge]
Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
They never die
[Chorus]
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, blood of heroes
Still alive, blood of heroes
Never die, blood of heroes
