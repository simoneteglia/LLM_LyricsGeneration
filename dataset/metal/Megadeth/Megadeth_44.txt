[Verse 1]
Let me introduce myself
I'm a social disease
I've come for your wealth
Leave you on your knees
No time for feeling sorry
I got here on my own
I won't ask for mercy
I choose to walk alone
[Pre-Chorus]
What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers
[Chorus]
What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears
And the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind
[Verse 2]
You built walls to protect you
So no one will infect you
Pursued by those out there
That vanish in thin air
Come a long way to find
What you really left behind
You don't know when the end is
But it's coming fast
[Pre-Chorus]
What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers
[Chorus]
What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgement?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all
I ought to get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears
And the only consequences
Are dread and the fugitive mind
[Guitar Solo]
