[Verse 1]
How much pain
Do you need to feel?
How much shame
Do you have to conceal?
There is no sunshine
Just endless nights
Nobody's there, nobody cares
When you cry
[Chorus]
Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows
[Verse 2]
How many secrets
Do you keep inside?
How many sins
Do you have to hide?
The haunting masses
Have blackened the sun
You'll pay for everything you've done
One by one
[Chorus]
Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows
[Chorus]
Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows
Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Clawing everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows
[Outro]
"It's like, I woke up, and she was right there
You know, I could almost touch her
Although she's been gone for years now
I can feel her, I can feel her watching me."
