[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Welcome to an empty fortress
A mighty wreck that once was proud
Ate alive by oxidation
Abandoned by a crew of cowards
Navigation systems failed
Computers crashed and they all fall down
[Refrain]
Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
All the guilty paid the price
Suspended by their broken necks
No one survived to tell the story
When foreign life forms resurrect
And military intelligence
Is still two words that can't make sense
[Refrain]
Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much
[Instrumental Outro]
