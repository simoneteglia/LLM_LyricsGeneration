[Verse 1]
I should be calling collect from jail
For the things I commit each night in my head
Like last night in my sleep, I got to snuff you
But then I woke up again, safe in my little bed
[Refrain]
No one is safe when I close my eyes
I come to take your life
[Verse 2]
I get to force your untimely disappearance
Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep
I close my eyes, and you just vanish soon as I
Lay down my head when I'm dead to the whole wide world
[Refrain]
No one is safe when I close my eyes
I come to take your life
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And then I wake up again
And it was all just a dream
And everything is the same
[Chorus 1]
(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
(Go to sleep)
And throw you off of a bridge?
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
(Go to sleep)
Pray your soul's mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Go to sleep)
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
Sleepwalker
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
[Post-Chorus]
Just taking a stroll, don't go to sleep
Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!
[Verse 3]
You always make an excellent cadaver
I roll up your body in a carpet to make music in the
Trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rug
A fitting end is that I send you up the river like a punk
[Refrain]
No one is safe when I close my eyes
I come to take your life
[Verse 4]
The angel of death is pissed off at me again
Just because I got to put you out of my misery
It doesn't matter, I am without fear
Now you're dead, I won't shed another bloody tear for you
[Refrain]
No one is safe when I close my eyes
I come to take your life
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm calling down the thunder
Then you'll sleep with the fishes
The answer to all of my wishes
[Chorus 2]
(Sleepwalker) Did I tell you I was in movies
(Go to sleep)
Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) Every day, another way
(Go to sleep)
I know you can hear me
(Go to sleep)
[Verse 5]
I think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktie
Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear
[Refrain]
No one is safe when I close my eyes
I come to take your life
[Pre-Chorus 3]
And then I wake up
And it was all just a dream
And everything is still the same
[Chorus 3]
(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
(Go to sleep)
And throw your body off of a bridge?
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
(Go to sleep)
Pray your soul's mine to keep, I feel you near me
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) Or did I tell you I was in movies
(Go to sleep)
Then dump you garroted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) Every day, another way
(Go to sleep)
I know you can hear me
(Go to sleep)
[Outro]
(Sleepwalker) Did I buy you the farm
(Go to sleep)
Put a horse head in your bed?
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
(Go to sleep)
Pray your soul is mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) Every day
(Go to sleep)
Every day, another way
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep
(Go to sleep)
Pray your soul is mine to keep
I know you can hear me
(Go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep, go to sleep)
