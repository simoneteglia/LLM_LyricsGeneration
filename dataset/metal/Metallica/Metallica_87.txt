[Verse 1]
Chaos
Awaiting for Adam's return
Madness
Smiling, as we watch it burn
[Chorus]
I've become
Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind
[Verse 2]
Garden
Of Eden, so simple and pure
Greedy
Needy, must we have more?
[Chorus]
I've become
Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind
[Verse 3]
Fascinate
Partner of insanity
Decimate
Lessons we never learn
Dominate
Killing of the innocence
Deviate
And to dust you return
Yeah
[Refrain]
Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Seized by the day
All the dark days of your life
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Led so astray
All the dark days of your life
[Verse 4]
Zero
Reset, creation of man
Foolish
Ready, to witness again?
[Chorus]
I've become
Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind
[Outro]
Faith in man(un)kind
Oh, faith in man(un)kind
Faith in man(un)kind
Oh, faith in man(un)kind
