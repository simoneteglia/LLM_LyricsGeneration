[Refrain]
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
[Verse 1]
The beast still shouts for what it's yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiven misbehaving
[Chorus]
If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be
[Refrain]
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
[Verse 2]
So paint your eyеs as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
Thе nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation
[Chorus]
If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Return again to where it's darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated
[Chorus]
If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
[Post-Chorus]
If darkness had a son (Here I am)
If darkness had a son (Here I am)
If darkness had a son (Here I am)
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be
