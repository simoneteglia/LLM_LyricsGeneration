[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
[Chorus]
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
[Verse 2]
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
[Chorus]
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
[Chorus]
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear
[Outro]
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
,
fight
