[Verse 1]
Slaves, Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed, to his every word
Live in fear
Faith, of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait, something must be done
Four-hundred years
[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
[Verse 2]
Now, let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long
Hail to fire
[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Die (Die)
By my hand (Die, die)
I creep across the land (Die, die)
Killing first-born man (Die, die, die)
Die (Die)
By my hand (Die, die)
I creep across the land (Die, die)
Killing first-born man (Die, die, die)
[Verse 3]
I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood, lamb's blood-painted door
I shall pass
[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
