[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
No mercy for what we're doing
No thought to even what we've done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
[Pre-Chorus]
War without end
[Chorus]
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
[Verse 2]
Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
"No remorse" is the one command
[Pre-Chorus]
War without end
[Chorus]
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We're ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
[Pre-Chorus]
War without end
[Chorus]
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
[Bridge]
Attack!
Bullets are flying, people are dying
With madness surrounding, all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going, blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting, swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening, you know death is near
[Outro]
No remorse
