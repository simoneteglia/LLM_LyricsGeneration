[Verse 1]
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt, therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb
[Verse 2]
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift, pulsing with the Earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep
[Chorus]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeding I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift (Back to the meaning)
Back to the meaning of life
[Verse 3]
Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift, call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized
[Chorus]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeding I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift (Back to the meaning)
Back to the meaning of life
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I feel a change, back to a better day
(Shapeshift) Hair stands on the back of my neck
(Shapeshift)
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself
[Outro]
Shapeshift, nose to the wind
Shapeshift, feeding I have been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning
Back to the meaning
Of wolf and man, yeah
