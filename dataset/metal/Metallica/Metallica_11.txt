[Verse 1]
Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower
[Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay
[Chorus]
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
,
justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
[Verse 2]
Apathy their stepping stone
,
so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
,
so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
,
hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
[Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay
[Chorus]
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
,
justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Lady justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again
,
make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel
[Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
We pay
[Chorus]
Nothing can save us
Justice is lost
,
justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
[Outro]
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
