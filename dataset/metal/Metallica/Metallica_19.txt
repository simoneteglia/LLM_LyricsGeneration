[Intro]
All right
[Verse 1]
We're scanning the scene
In the city tonight
We're looking for you
To start up a fight
There's an evil feeling
In our brains
But it's nothing new
You know it drives us insane
[Pre-Chorus]
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
[Chorus]
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
[Verse 2]
There is no escape
And that's for sure
This is the end
We won't take any more
Say goodbye
To the world you live in
You've always been taking
And now you're giving
[Pre-Chorus]
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
[Chorus]
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Our brains are on fire
With the feeling to kill
And it won't go away
Until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
On our minds
Don't try running away
'Cause you're the one we will find
[Pre-Chorus]
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
[Chorus]
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy, aha-ha-ha-ha
[Guitar Solo]
