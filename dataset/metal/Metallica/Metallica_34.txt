[Verse 1]
Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free
[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One
, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
[Verse 2]
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens
, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
In madness you dwell
[Verse 3]
Not dead, which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be
[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
