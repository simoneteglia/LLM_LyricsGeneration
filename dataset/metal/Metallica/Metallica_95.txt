[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's wanting through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow
[Chorus]
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now, take the chance
That's right
Let's dance
[Verse 1]
Snake, I am the snake
Tempting, that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed
[Chorus]
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now, take the chance
Haha, come dance
Yeah, come dancing
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now, take the chance
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I feel you too
Feel, those things you do
In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you
That's running through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow
[Chorus]
One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now, take the chance
That's right
Let's dance
[Outro]
It's nice to see you here
Haha!
