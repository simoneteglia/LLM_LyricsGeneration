[Intro]
Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
[Verse 1]
Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
Mm-ah, I twist away as I give this world the nod
[Bridge]
Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
[Verse 2]
Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Don't want control
, ay-yeah
As it takes me down, and down, and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?
[Chorus]
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built
[Chorus]
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
'Cause this is the house that Jack built
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin (Let the show begin)
[Chorus]
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
'Cause this is the house that Jack built
The higher you are
The farther you fall
Longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
'Cause I am, I am, I am
[Outro]
Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away
