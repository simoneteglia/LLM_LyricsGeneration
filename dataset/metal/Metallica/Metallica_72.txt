[Verse 1]
If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at Karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?
Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to deal with what I shouldn't know?
Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
[Pre-Chorus]
You live it or lie it, you live it or lie it
(You live it or lie it, you live it or lie it)
My lifestyle determines my death style
My lifestyle determines my death style
[Chorus]
Keep searching, keep on searching
This search goes on, this search goes on
Keep searching, keep on searching
This search goes on, this search goes on
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
[Verse 2]
I've worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
This frantic tick, tick talk of hurry
Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to deal with what I shouldn't know?
Worn out always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made
[Pre-Chorus]
You live it or lie it, you live it or lie it
(You live it or lie it, you live it or lie it)
My lifestyle determines my death style
My lifestyle determines my death style
[Chorus]
Keep searching, keep on searching
This search goes on, this search goes on
Keep searching, yeah, I keep on searching
This search goes on, on and on
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
[Bridge]
Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to deal with what I shouldn't know?
Do I have the strength to know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside to deal with what I shouldn't know?
Oh, my lifestyle determines my death style
(Birth is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side
(Life is pain)
My lifestyle determines my death style
(Death is pain)
A rising tide that pushes to the other side
(It's all the same)
[Chorus]
Keep searching, keep on searching
This search goes on, on and on
Keep searching, keep on searching
This search goes on, on and on
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
Frantic, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick tock
