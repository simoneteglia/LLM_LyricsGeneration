[Verse 1]
Ooh, run away, the past will bite again
Ooh, no matter where you dwell
You, here again, a captive of the howl
You, welcome back to hell
[Refrain]
Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding
[Pre-Chorus]
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change
[Chorus]
Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
[Verse 2]
Ooh, tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooh, foul tongue, black breath
Change, snap inside, the Beast about complete
Change, soon infects the rest
[Refrain]
Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding
[Pre-Chorus]
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back,
shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change
[Chorus]
Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore
[Verse 3]
Ooh, inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooh, the next heir of anarchy
Feel, stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel, the ever changing, you, in me
[Chorus]
Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don't recognize me anymore
Anymore
[Outro]
Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?
