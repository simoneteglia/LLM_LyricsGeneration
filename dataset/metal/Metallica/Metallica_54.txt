[Verse 1]
No life â€˜til leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming, it's right
Well, all right, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again
[Chorus]
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
[Verse 2]
You know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today
The only way, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again
[Chorus]
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
[Verse 3]
With all-out screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain
Oh, sweet pain, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again
[Chorus]
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
