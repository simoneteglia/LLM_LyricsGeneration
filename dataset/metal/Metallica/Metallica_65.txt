[Instrumental Intro 00:00-01:20]
[Verse 1]
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you
To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime
[Chorus]
I'm outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
And I'm torn
[Verse 2]
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime
[Chorus]
I'm outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
And I'm torn
[Bridge]
(Hear me) And if I close my mind in fear
Please, pry it open
(See me) And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
(Hold me) And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
(Save me) And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
[Instrumental Break 05:11-07:00]
[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]
[Bridge]
(Hear me) And if I close my mind in fear
Please, pry it open
(See me) And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
(Hold me) And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
(Save me) And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
