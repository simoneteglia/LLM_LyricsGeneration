[Verse 1]
I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
[Chorus]
Freezing (Freezing), can't move at all
Screaming (Screaming), can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, I'm trapped under ice
[Verse 2]
Crystallized as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep, I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
[Chorus]
Freezing (Freezing), can't move at all
Screaming (Screaming), can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, I'm trapped under ice
[Bridge]
(Scream) From my soul
(Fate) Mystified
(Hell) Forevermore
(Scream) From my soul
(Fate) Mystified
(Hell) Forevermore
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me
[Chorus]
Freezing (Freezing), can't move at all
Screaming (Screaming), can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, I'm trapped under ice
Freezing (Freezing), can't move at all
Screaming (Screaming), can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, I'm trapped under ice
