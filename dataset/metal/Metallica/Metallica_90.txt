[Verse 1]
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
S-s-s-s-so many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?
[Pre-Chorus]
(What the hell?) What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
(Hypocrite) Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
[Chorus]
(Struggle within) It suits you fine
(Struggle within) Your ruin
(Struggle within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle within) The struggling within
[Verse 2]
Home is not a home, it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hell-ow
(Reaching out) Reaching out
Grabbing for something you have got to feel
(Closing in) Closing in
The pressure upon you is so unreal
[Chorus]
(Struggle within) It suits you fine
(Struggle within) Your ruin
(Struggle within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle within) The struggling within
Struggle
[Guitar Solo]
Go!
[Bridge]
Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
[Pre-Chorus]
What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mind
[Chorus]
(Struggle within) It suits you fine
(Struggle within) Your ruin
(Struggle within) You seal your own coffin
(Struggle within) The struggling within
