[Verse 1]
Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence
Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless
[Verse 2]
Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral
Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral
[Pre-Chorus]
Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again
[Chorus]
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
[Verse 3]
Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution
Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin
[Pre-Chorus]
Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again
[Chorus]
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
[Post-Chorus]
Burn!
[Bridge]
Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do that fistful will
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction
Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction
[Pre-Chorus]
So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again
[Chorus]
Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
[Outro]
Addicted to the fame
