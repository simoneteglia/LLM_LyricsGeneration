[Intro]
(All within my hands)
[Verse 1]
All within my hands
Squeeze it in, crush it down
All within my hands
Hold it dear, hold it suffocate
[Verse 2]
All within my hands
Love to death, smack you around and around and
All within my hands
Beware
[Pre-Chorus]
Love is control, I'll die if I let go
Love is control, I'll die if I let go
[Chorus]
Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands again
[Verse 3]
All within my hands
Take your fear, pump me up
All within my hands
Let you run, then I pull your leash
[Bridge]
All within my
(Hands)
[Verse 4]
All within my hands
Under thumb, under to myself
All within my hands
Beware
[Pre-Chorus]
Love is control, I'll die if I let go
Love is control, I'll die if I let go (let it go)
[Chorus]
Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Choke all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands again
[Bridge]
I'll die if I let go
Control is love, love is control
I'll fall if I let go
Control is love, love is control
I will only let you breathe
My air that you receive
Then we'll see if I let you love me
I will only let you breathe
My air that you receive
Then we'll see if I let you love me
Love is control
[Chorus]
Hate me now
Kill all within my hands
Hate me now
Crush all within my hands again (yeah, yeah)
Choke all within my hands
Squeeze all within my hands
Hate me now
Trap all within my hands
Hurry up and hate me now
Kill all within my hands again
[Outro]
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
