[Intro]
So fucking what?
[Verse 1]
Well, I've been to Hastings and I've been to Brighton
I've been to Eastbourne too,
so what? So what?
And I've been here, I've been there
I've been every fucking where,
so what? So what?
So what? So what, you boring little cunt?
[Chorus]
Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you
[Verse 2]
Well, I fucked a queen, I fucked Bach
I've even sucked an old man's cock, so what? So what?
And I fucked a sheep, I fucked a goat
I rammed my cock right down its throat,
so what? So what?
So what? So what, you boring little fuck?
[Chorus]
Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
And who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you
[Verse 3]
And I've drunk that, I've drunk this
I've spewed up on a pint of piss, so what? So what?
I've had skank,

I've jacked up until I bleed,

So what? So what, you boring little cunt?
[Chorus]
Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you, you

I've even fucked a school girl's twat, so what? So what?
So what? So what, you boring little fuck?
