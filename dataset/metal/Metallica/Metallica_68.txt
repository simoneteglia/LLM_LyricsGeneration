[Verse 1]
Welcome, won't you come inside?
Meet the ghosts where I reside
Despite how they're abusin' me
Lonely I will never be
Comfort in the hell I know
Resentment like a cancer grows
Longing for the day I'm free
Burn to get you out of me
[Pre-Chorus]
Lyin', supplyin' the need
Shedding and spreading the seed
Setting the trap with a thread
Spinnin' the web
[Chorus]
Misery, she needs me
Oh, oh, but I need her more
Misery, she loves me
Oh, oh, but I love her more
Misery, she kills me
Oh, oh, but I end this war
Misery, she fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm livin' for
[Verse 2]
Ricochets within my head
Conversations never said
Magnifyin' every thought
That familiar pain she brought
Seeps inside eventually
Misery loves company
Sullen, I created you
I suppose that I could end you too
[Pre-Chorus]
She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)
She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)
[Chorus]
Misery, she needs me
Oh, oh, but I need her more
Misery, she loves me
Oh, oh, but I love her more
Misery, she kills me
Ooh, but I end this war
Misery, she fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm livin' for, oh no
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Ooh, misery
She needs me
But I need her more
She loves me
But I love her more
She kills me (She kills me)
But I end this war
She fills me (She fills me)
But she's not what I'm livin' for, oh no, oh no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Not why I'm livin'
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Misery, she needs me
Oh, oh, but I need her more
Misery, she loves me
Oh, but I love her more
Misery, she kills me
Oh, but I end this war
Misery, she fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm livin' for
[Refrain]
(Misery, my misery)
(Misery, my misery)
(Misery) She's not why I'm livin' (My misery)
She's not why I'm livin'
(Misery)
She's not what I'm livin' for (My misery)
No, no
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
"Thank you, good night"
"That was the best one"
"That button was the best one"
"The best button"
