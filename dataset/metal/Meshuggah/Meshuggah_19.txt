[Verse 1]
The void clenches its determined jaws
A lethargic, careless motion to kill
Monstrous, prodigious, indifferent
Slow and deliberate its torturous skills
[Verse 2]
Its molars grind and shatter
Onerous, leaden bringers of hurt
Unhurried in its deadly intent
The undoer of all, dense and inert
[Bridge]
Its design perfected through aeons
Pure, immaculate, clean, omnicidal god/machine
[Verse 3]
Calm, precise ambition
Untroubled by the roar of unending screams
The droning blare of absolute doom
The downpitched moan of collapsing dreams
[Verse 4]
Composed, cold, unconditional
Uncompromising 'til all is death
Extinction, ruin, its malicious cause
'Til the last exhalation of human breath
