Back again within myself
Asleep but aware, I'm lost again
Every time I close my eyes
I enter the dream to which i'm strained
A sudden change into a state
Where life is dust and everything flows
Circling above swirling seas
Of eyes upraised toward the unknown
Vapor masques in the leaden air
Unleashed by death in a grubby dawn
Vacant faces reflecting sorrow
Hidden inside senses disowned
A maze of glass shattered by thoughts
Of a faltered soul freed in bliss
Clouds disperse revealing shades
Tempting my soul i can't resist
A vision of morbidity
Of ragged silent shadows dressed in black disease
They're closing up on me
Peering, lifeless, weary eyes
They drag me down into another world inside of me
Paralyzed
By the view
Hypnotized
Let me wake
Mesmerized by the flames as I return into myself
A slow conversion
A silent change
I wake into the brightened day
