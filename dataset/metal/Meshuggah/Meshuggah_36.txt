So imminently visible â€“ this cloaked innocent guilt
Sentenced to a lifetime, a second of structured chaos
Trampled by the ferocious, raging crowds of solitude
I'm the soil beneath me
Soaking up the sustenance of my own death
Extradited to the gods of chance, the deities of all things random
Alive, multicolored
Twitching in their dead monochrome world
