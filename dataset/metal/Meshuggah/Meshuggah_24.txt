Skyline draped in shimmering red
Irradiant and treacherous
Neon prophecies hail the end,
the capital of piety
Totalitarianopolis
, city of dread
The glorious streets of dystopia continuously running red
This is where self is relinquished
Autonomy sacrificed
The idolatry of tyrants compulsory
Welcome all to MonstroCity where norm is that of the insane
All is illusion in MonstroCity
Bow to it,
it knows your name
Relishing the idea of damnation
"The wailing and gnashing of teeth"
They know for sure where judgment's due
"What's above and what's beneath"
This is where we fail, where the self-righteous reign
The empire of imaginary ghosts
This is blind credulity's domain
MonstroCity
MonstroCity
MonstroCity
MonstroCity
In here everyone knows "the truth"
Which unforgiving icon is real
Intolerance and prejudice saturates their zeal
This is where self is relinquished
Autonomy sacrificed
The idolatry of tyrants compulsory
Welcome all to MonstroCity where norm is that of the insane
All is illusion in MonstroCity
Bow to it, it knows your name
