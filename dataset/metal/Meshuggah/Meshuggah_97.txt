Justice ruined by eternal travesty
Bloodcurdling hammer soon to be released
Stalking brutality, tomorrow we will see
Unjustified agony unleashed
Strangling superstitious braces
Rampage overboard
Remoted death masks have no faces
We only see the cord
Led to paths and alleys
Chosen by a treacherous source
Squeeze the odds down to our last days
To summon up their force
Folded to pernicious chambers
Pounded by the walls
Disappear, no one remembers
Nobody hear our calls
Ruthless saints prey upon us
The society of friends
They are the wounds, we are the pus
No matter how it ends
Maimed and left to putrefy
Betrayed by society
Indiscreet, left to die
Filled with indignity
We will come to grief
By this irrational democracy
What's a life worth for humanity?
Nothing more than justice by insanity
Utilization, covetousness
A voracious mouth to feed
Fatal greed engraves our death
Chokes our possibilities
We are the children of this devastating science
We are the lost till the end
We are the witness who knows who is lying
Forgotten we are dying
We are dying
We'll never see the day
We'll never see the day
We'll never see the day
We'll never see the day
