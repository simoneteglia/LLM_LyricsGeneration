This untethering from logic
This beautiful, terrifying state
Astonishing
Uninhibited
Maddening
Euphoric
I now see through you
Translucent entities
Gone is the veil of sanity
The colors I now discern
Veracity as a boundless spectrum
A vast kaleidoscope
Spiraling enlightenment
Magnificent altered condition
Confined no more my vision
Inert and bursting
Here impossibles co-exist
In this vibrant domain
Truth is anything you dream it is
Here I can sense true fulfillment
Shedding the old, finding a new I
Devoid of restraints
Exempt from your lies
