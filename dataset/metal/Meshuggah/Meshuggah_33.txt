Relentless and inexorable
This menacing creation
That we ourselves conceived
With covetous verve and credulity
Something this intensely profound
Can never be allowed
The fabric and all that holds it
Will all burn
It will all be torn down
To contain it in its lair
Pandora's quantum prison
In wave after wave
It will see us fail
Consign to oblivion
This thing we cannot grasp
Bury deep this entity
Unlearn it ever existed
This is our omega
Factitious nemesis
The great dismantler
Of our dominion
If evеr there was a reason
Maintain this grеatest lie
That never did we look
Into the abysmal eye
