Jealous vengeful fabrication
Halo-crowned invention
Sacred universal lie
Artificial divine
Great archaic obsoletum
A prevarication
Deceitfully contrived
Synthesized fictitious
Dreamed up by remote prototypes
Opiate for the yearning mass
Administered applied
Three letter word for monster
Empty promises of healing
Profit aptly buried in the lies
An industry rapt with avarice
Medicating
blind
Its
acolytes
Useless panacea
Imaginary cure-all
To you we cry and supplicate
Into your hell we fall
Blind belief in their eyes
Forever atoning, credulously waiting
Gazing to the skies
