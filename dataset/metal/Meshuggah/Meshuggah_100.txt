Vitalize your benevolent thoughts today
Encrust the encumbrance that encroach your brain
A devastated world we'll see in tomorrow's society
Crushed by our own alternatives, we've got ourselves to blame
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
We obliterate ourselves
Procrastinated measures decrease our chance to save
'Cause you've always got something else in mind
The reign's rain of pollution melts our opportunities
Conjectural in their comfortable lives
Stupidity separated by a wall of glass
We have to stop this immediately, this fucking mess
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
We obliterate ourselves
Procrastinated measures decreases our chance to save
'Cause you've always got something else in mind
Why?
Now it's time to save us
Nature's demise
We can't control our accesses
Spreading pollution
We fumble till the end
The end
The water is filled with toxic waste
And the air is filled with shit to breathe
A dismembered world we'll see
We are in deep shit
We have to change this world
Start to communicate
We can't go on like this
No, no
Because of greed
Now it's time to perceive our inauspicious oversight
We're leaning on death against compensation
Are we so afraid to lose our welfare society
That we have to sacrifice the earth?
Tons of death's spreading out violent solitude
We obliterate ourselves
Procrastinated measures decreases our chance to save
'Cause you've always got something else in mind
Why?
