I can't run away from this thing in me
I'm weakening down another now developing
Within
I can feel it it's inside my head
Connected to my brain this other me is
Slowly taking over deep beneath the
Eye that
All can see energic visions of the one
I know myself to be
Look into my eyes don't listen to their lies
How can I stop this from being real
No my life will be no longer what it always
Used to be
Life neglected infected by strain
I fall into the smothering the even
Flow of
Ravaging pain this my temple of selfcaged
Contempt a body slowly pierced by
Inevitable me
Do I differ from yourself am I like
They say
The truth eventually I'm the one you
Wanna be
Can you feel the same as I another inside
Pushing to free itself from the chains
Of the soul
Turn your eyes toward the inside
Dig deep within I'm sure you'll find
A different self a different soul
To put you in peace with mind
