Hear the mourners
The earth is gasping for air
Sneering at this thoughtless ravage
If we don't wake we'll massacre ourselves
Sneaking skullduggery
Slaughter the lungs of humanity
Spreading devastation through this world
A price we never can pay
Dethrone the impassive governments
No more of this dupery
Pollution of environment
Stop this now
Before it's too late
Mouldering world
You're dying slowly piece by piece
All the riches you've created
Will soon be laid destroyed
Dethrone the impassive governments
No more of this dupery
Pollution of environment
Stop this now
Before it's too late
People
Obey your eyes
We can't repair when it's all destroyed, no way
Dupery
Approaching death
Tomorrow falls
Why?
People
Obey your eyes
We can't repair when it's all destroyed, no way
Dupery
Approaching death
Tomorrow falls
Why?
Paralysed by ignorance
The cemetery plans continue
A tremendous trepidation
Perfidious annihilation
All in vain
