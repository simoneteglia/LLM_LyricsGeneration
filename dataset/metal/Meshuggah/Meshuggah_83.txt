Trapped in a gaze where time stand still
Connected to a blur sensations deformed
We are to drown just to become
Another set of eyes among the millions
Enchanted we fade selecting illusions
Dwellers of the scene a new world obsessed
Gods of displays divine screens
Radiate us now your blessing
Down kneel to shields of glass
To the sovereign
Bleed for the entity of wavelenghts
Transfixed yet eyes glowing with delight
Delusions of omniscience bred us by liars
Mentally drained by the growing leech
Fed on our manic desire
Oceans of sewage continual
Washing into our minds
Drowning in wasted integrity
With eyes too open to see vanity
Engulfed in super fiction fields
What are we when the false pictures
Dissolve
Caged within a twilight world
Devoid of own self made thoughts
Stare blind...
