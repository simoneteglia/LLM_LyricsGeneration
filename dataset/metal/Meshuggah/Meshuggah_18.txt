What solace lies in the arms of fate
The ill embrace of uncertainty
When did I leave this in other hands
To be pulled down at chance
Ripped away by destiny-claws
Am I another of fate's possessions
Dwelling the lie of freedom
Just another straw pulled at random
Reclaimed by deceiving time
A silent judgment I can not overrule
Drawn back into the origin-vortex
Uprooted and ground to dust
Retracted into anti-existence
A magnet repelled by life's polarity
Denied the self control of fate
We flow suspended in semi-life
Until the ever imminent day
When oblivion claims our breath
Nowhere indefinitely. Not dead, not alive
Existence-patterns ripped of symmetry. As will and
Fate divide
Have I appeased the gods of fate
Am I allowed another day
Must I die to escape
The scanning eyes of death
