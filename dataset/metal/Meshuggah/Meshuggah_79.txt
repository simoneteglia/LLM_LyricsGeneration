Come and hear my twisted lies
The way I bend and falsify
A master of deception
User of an untrue smile
A rapist of the truth
Adapting it to fit my cause
I'm the human lie
A sad composition of all things vile
Come read my tainted lies
Lies
Come see my wretched, tainted mind
Bury, cover up, repress
I betray the people I possess
Whatever enemy, I'll disable with mendacity
I make my way, extend my ground
I clear my future path
When it comes to joys, manipulation is my game of choice
How I shine
I
The perfect freak
Confide in me
Me
Believe
In me
My intentions: soon you will see
The sway of my scheme, imposed upon all
Come follow me, my puppets to be
I'll attach my strings
Manipulation begins
Sane
Me
Sane
Me
Sane
Me
Sane
Me
I'm the way
I'm the truth
Gather with me
I'm the future guide
Sane
Me
Sane
Me
Gather with me
Join my ministry
I'm the way
The future guide
I'm the self-acclaimed God of wicked games
Sinister, repugnant bringer of pain
Pain
