[Verse 1]
I know what people say
And I know much sweeter days
And I know I'm out of my mind
Darlin', reach out to me
I think I'm a metabolic island
When left alone, we all just melt away
[Chorus]
The stars are out in clearest weather
How to keep yourself together?
Darling only know
Darling only know
Your enemies are fierce and foul
Energy is peace and power
Darling only know
You give meshuggah
You give meshuggah
[Verse 2]
I know of saccharine
And I know of insulin
And I know I'm out of my mind
Darlin', it's only us
And I know it's treacherous
And I know when left alone
We all just melt away
[Chorus]
The stars are out in clearest weather
How to keep yourself together?
Darling only know
Darling only know
Your enemies are fierce and foul
Energy is peace and power
Darling only know
You give meshuggah
You give meshuggah
[Chorus]
The stars are out in clearest weather
How to keep yourself together?
Darling only know
Darling only know
Your enemies are fierce and foul
Energy is peace and power
Darling only know
You give meshuggah
You give meshuggah
You give meshuggah
You give meshuggah
