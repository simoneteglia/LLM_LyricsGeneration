Strive, strive, surmount the obstacles
Become the essence of your goals, hereditary dream
Pray that you may attain that destiny, fall into the coveted line
Where life is but a theme of pretense in lustrous guise
Claims and values, charts of means and status
Plaques to show your strife. Do your neighbour clones approve
Picture perfect illustration - imitation of life
Where the path is evened out. All obstructions removed
Great viable citizen
Are you happy now? Then praise your God and bow
Shimmering surface, the gleam of blinding lies
Become the product, the thing you so desire
To what length would you go to reach your goals
What mantra will you use to justify your means
Who will you betray to secure your dream
What sins will you commit to avoid your sins be seen
Do not look down, do not look down
Or the abysmal beast of nonconformity
Might stare some unpleasant truth
Into your desensitized mind
Shimmering surface, the gleam of blinding lies
Become the product, the thing you so desire
