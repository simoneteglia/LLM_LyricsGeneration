Impotent king beneath our feet
You can rule down where you belong
In dirt compacted, buried deep, you dwell with those you wronged
Down there you can whisper, yell, even blare your odious lies
To your silent audience of worms as they share with you, your eyes
Tyrant, oppressor
Your once resounding voice now just muted cries
Your self-avowed murderous god
Ranks of annelids now you delegate
Your commands unheard under ground
Where your voice will never resonate
Your time has come
Declare the majesty fallen
Your dominance, your hateful influence forever stifled
Your sleep no longer impermanent
Decaying matter now sums you up
Like all the lives you've taken
Now so are you retreating to dust
