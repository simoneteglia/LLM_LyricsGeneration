[Verse 1]
An even strobe
A pulse
Of flashing hate lights
Of synthetic souls
Mass produced
Hammered into shape
A sign of times
Dreams turn
Into systems
A new way
A new breed
Implanted in our minds
Here I am
In the hand of
Sterile hate
The new control
I cannot wake
I'm not asleep
[Verse 2]
New intelligence
Arise
In emptied bodies
Turgid flesh
Tested
Through eternal spastic fits
Through not
Known codes
Mother machine
In genocide
Now scorn
A dying race
[Chorus]
Evolution
In reverse
Now it's time for me
Changing
What am I to be
Contorted
An eternity
Defeated
[Bridge]
Programmed to appease you
We're symbols of perfection
Humanoids ruined by your laws
Destroy erase improve
Lesson first submission
We're docile servant dogs
Our leashes are your limbs
Computed deep within
[Interlude & Solo]
Remoted minds
Controlled our thoughts
No more doubts
The new way is here
Disgorged
Another thousand fakes
That obey
To a circuit skein
To vacuum
Mechanical thoughts
I now conceive no longer me
Always to see inanity
Millions to be units like me
Eternally
Human patterns
Copied, dissected, distorted
Completed to fit the machine
The nerve fibers give in to cords
To the unknown
See me
Be me
Same contents
Same machine
The currency
Of ours no more
Flesh and bone
We are to be
Unaware
Of what we have been before
[Chorus]
Evolution
In reverse
Now it's time for me
Changing
What am I to be
Contorted
An eternity
Defeated
By the new machine
