No one knows the soul of tears
And why can't we see human indignity?
Who will laugh at the growing suffering?
The bleeding
Rapidly breeding
Increasing
The clock is ticking on before us
Constantly running hypnotized
Energized by naivety
Take a pick at random
Choose our future to be crawling in the mess of stupidity
We won't hear when we're dead and gone
We trust in lies or a fake paradise
Are we blinded 'til the bitter end
Decided or maybe very misguided?
Travelling through endless times
Inside of nothingness
Reaching for a new belief
In vain
Insane
Our molded lives an ever catatonic flow
We're rejected ever more by lucidity
Why strange?
Why?
Why change?
Why not suicide?
No strange, no
No change, no
Not suicide
With ears that are shut to the inner voice
We're giving in to the shattering
Tell me, how can we take it?
Tell me, why are we here?
Hanging in the balance of deceit and blasphemy
Paralyzed in sightless drains
Ignorant and still no panic
No! Is there no way to be free?
No! No!
No, why me, not us?
Why not?
Blind, strange
Blind
Blind fate
Blind suicide
Damn faith
Damn
Damn lies
Why?
