[Verse 1]
A stale, organic cage
Incarceration
I'm in the stranger me
The user of my face
Beneath its guise i rot
A paradox in terms
Interconnected, fused
My words are its thoughts
I now share myself with my reflection
Straining to divide our twined formation
Duality within singularity
[Chorus]
Plug me in
Reconnect
Me to myself
Plug me in
Reconnect
Me to my soul
[Verse 2]
Coalescence done
The merging complete
The sentence carried out
The confluence
Our interwound flows
Surges not to be fused
In this mental cage we absorb ourselves
The only certainty is my suffering
My mind in constant pleas for an end to this concatenation
A struggle all in vain
We're both the same
[Chorus]
Plug me in
Reconnect
Me to myself
Plug me in
Reconnect
Me to my soul
[Bridge]
Gone is all my hope
All my vain illusions deceived
I dwell in me
In the core of my agony
I fade in this duress
I'm weakening
The one who claimed my front is now the claimant of my soul
[Outro]
Into the core of self
The neuro-axis
I fade
Within the fading core of self
I am
Gone-bound
Lost
Away
Phased out
Non-existing
