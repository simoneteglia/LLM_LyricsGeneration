I'm the concrete leper
Sickness repulsion embodied
Hear the sermon escaping my vermin mouth
You might even stay with me in the dirt
I'm soaked in putrid sewage risen from empty words
To you a legion of nausea
I'm your sins
I'm your crown of thorns
I've seen the blood of generations
The ravenous mouth called system
We're all shaped by vulgar hands
The grip of hate and lies
The sustenance to our bellicose ways
An ignorance almost justified
As the gap of humanity fraction grows
The skull of life lobotomized
Hear me
I'm ignominy
There's no renaissance in bleeding
No
I've flown a million minds
Black in despair
The liquids of uncertainty spit into their eyes
Our flesh embedded in counters of iniquity
It seems like we are all just merchandise
Not civilized
No words we adapt in our silence, paralyzed
To changes erasing the last denial lies
Attitudes crucified
Still we're going on, crawling toward submissive suicide
