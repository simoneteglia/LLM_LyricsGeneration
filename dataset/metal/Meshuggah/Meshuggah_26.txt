Stroboscopic contortion-assault
Light bulb language translated into fits
Codes of tendon-flickers I can't grasp
Focus lost as I writhe and twitch
Random beats of blinding shockwaves
Erratic suns that twist my eyes
Flashes pounding at my thoughts
As the intrinsic pains multiply
Muscle and tissue twined with every violent lash
Battered by an unrelenting shine
Immobilized by the increasing pains
The procreating agonies of system breakdown
Lightwave frequency body-oscillation
Undeciphered motions pass through my flesh
Bodily reverberation induced
A corporeal system lost in its waves
Bleached into their existence
By tremulous epileptic strokes
Blasts of irregular pulsar-radiation
Triggering the process of mind and body control
Lost
To their control, a sentence
In flashes told, enticed
By their calls
Insane, divine
Torn, undone, dissolved
By incandescent gods condemned
Burned their mark on my soul
To my inverted shadow confined
Twisted, spun
Vertebras and spinal column unaligned
Joints shattered and torn apart
Spasm-rendered distortion
Organic spiral
Stretched and torn into a new creation
A wordless thing, a thingless word
Lightborn malformation
