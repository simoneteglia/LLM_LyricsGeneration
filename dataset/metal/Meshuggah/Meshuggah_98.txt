This could've been a good day
To enjoy how life can be
But instead I wake up in myself
I look down ashamed to understand
What we ignore insanity
We wait for the problems to solve themselves
What the fuck happens here?
Nothing
Slovenry
Damn savagery
React
We're slowly drowning in our own mistakes
Deeper
Drowning
Breathing underwater death
Help
I wish I felt much better
Feels like I'm dying inside
By murdering this world
We'll all commit suicide
Search my mind for reasons
To this uncured depression
This void of emptiness prevails
What the fuck happens here?
Nothing
Slovenry
Damn savagery
React
We're slowly drowning in our own mistakes
Deeper
Drowning
Breathing underwater death
Will someone help me?
You know it yourself, nobody gives a damn
Why?
Because our dreams are left behind
Wake
Numbed pain, I'm null, feeling ill internally
Truth gone, lies here, crushed life, don't interfere
I'm trapped, wiped out, I'm dead eternally
Mind closed, torn soul, life ends, I'm dying here
This could've been a good day
To enjoy how life can be
But instead I wake up in myself
I look down ashamed to understand
What we ignore insanity
We wait for the problems to solve themselves
What the fuck happens here?
Nothing
Slovenry
Damn savagery
React
We're slowly drowning in our own mistakes
Deeper
Drowning
Breathing underwater death
Help
What am I doing here on this earth?
Why am I still awake?
Has someone heard?
What brought me here to this false humanity?
Why am I bound to this deranged deformity?
I'm dying here
