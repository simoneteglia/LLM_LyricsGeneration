A systematically applied veil to heedless eyes
Focus deflected, ignore
This is not our war
Bury the abject shame in the same bile as our ideals
The potent lubricant to deceit's grinding wheels
The menacing implications, the violent sleep of reason
Betrayal we all help sustain
Humanitarian treason
This deadly inclination, this forfeiture of innocence
The sacrifice of guiltless souls for our own deliverance
The pain you feel
Indifference thrust into your back
Forged from our ignorance from our immorality
A parody, this mockery
To no avail you kneel before this our insanity
Another life condemned
Your fate sealed the second you came to exist
Your suffering non-essential for we care not if you subsist
We will all belie any allusion, any crime
Cower and hide. Any culpability denied
All will imply it's an illusion, a fallacy
So when you die, remember we said it's not reality
