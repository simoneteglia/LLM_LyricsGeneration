Tortured soul ripping skin into ashes
Blind by pain, deaf by lies
Smell of freedom violently cuts
Forgiveness
Power to a being never dies
Suffer in truth's narrow passage saw
Weak solutions stabbed to not know
The smile of obliteration's face
Penetrating through the void of life
A dance with the dead
Buried in oblivion, stolen from the mind
Constant starving, never fed
Contaminated life is fading
Laughing in my face
Suffer in deception
Manipulated not to feel
Slain beliefs, abandoned dreams
A life of misery
Suffer in truth
Suffer in truth
The wounds of a soul in pain
A mirror of life
Dreams all in vain
Life will always be sealed
I see
Unseen
I feel
Unseen
Suffer in truth
Suffer
Suffer in truth
