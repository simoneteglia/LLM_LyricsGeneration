Why mourn this travesty
Hide this slow degradation
Claw and compete mindlessly
All things undone too late
Craving our waking sleep
Is binding us to this ivory tower
Serves to complete the truth that we cling onto
So what are these things you hold true?
The defensive wounds of the unknowing eye
Weeping thousands of wretched tears
To lubricate the end with our fear
The concussion from the crack of the whip
Nullifies, sensations die
Always numbing, always preaching
Never resting, never sleeping
The construction is our penance here
Tumorous growth chiseled in white
When the darkness comes to slay the day
Enters horrors that you'll be wishing away
Which is the way?
Which is the way?
Which is the way?
