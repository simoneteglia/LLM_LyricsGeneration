I don't need religion
God bless no one
Me and my own opinions
Are written by me
You surrender
Under mass hypnosis
Bound to illusions
Produced by your god
Who is humane
Real alive no god
I see your blindness
Erase your identity
Your mind is hollow
Carved to inability
I know to be
Loyal to myself
My integrity leaves myself
Alone in peace with me
God
There's no god
Life is a trap
Unlock your mind
Trust in yourself
Wake from the grip of the tongue
You've been choked oppressed
God owns god cheats god lies
God hates god kills god slays
The pressure on humanity
Has risen beyond control
We are leading evolution
Into termination
The sense of hate
Inbreeding scars to innocence
Genetic prejudice a
Selfdestructive line in pain
Why this reality
Life poured into inanity
