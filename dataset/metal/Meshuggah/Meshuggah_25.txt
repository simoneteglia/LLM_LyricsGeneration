[Verse 1]
Humanity peeled from our bones
Deprived of integuments that make us real
Shadows of flesh to maintain the system
Our own blood splashes as we kneel
[Verse 2]
So meticulously machined
Into these obedient devices
- Puppets, fine-tuned submissive drones
Replicas of each other, clones
[Chorus]
We're dormant accumulations of flesh
In a crimson filtered twilight
Mute witnesses to the game
Wrenches to keep the bolts of lies tight
We're the fabric concealing the stains
The red tainted existence
The gullibles to bless your sins away
Rags to wipe your blooded trails
[Bridge]
We give in to the atrophy
To the twining of self-thought knowledge
The purpose of the human mind reviled
Everlasting ignorance realized
The scarlet flood inundates our powerless thoughts
Defenseless minds with lies overfed
[Outro]
Every thought stained, defiled
- Painted the color, the shade of electric red
