Tremors, reverberating frequency of doom
How strongly the violent thoughts of vengeance echo
Setting in motion the strings of hate
Shudder, shudder, vibrate
This is the soundtrack to our hostility, to our malicious intent
To the pointless grudge forever held
The callow dream, the dismal wish to harm
Animate now the twisted sounds of our disdain, our rage
The notations to our contempt, to unforgiveness and loathing
A sonic declaration of spite and resentment
Its resonance grinding to dust our souls
The twine of revenge tightly strung
Its subharmonics the undoing of all
So enticing the retaliation-chords of man
The all-deafening oscillation of the damned
Let forth the hateful, the murderous
Let their malignant prayers resound
The reverberant, odious request
The wish of death abound
So enticing the retalitation-chords of man
The all-deafening oscillation of the damned
