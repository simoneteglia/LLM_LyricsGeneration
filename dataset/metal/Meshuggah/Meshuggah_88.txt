Here we are to stay
We all can see the purblind day
Assail the cause
Defray the ogre, the insubordinates
Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are all bound to fall
Mortality
We see today, defrauds our dreams
Approachable to die
Sliced by their lies, secured morbidity
Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are bound to fall
How many of the judges place a bet on me?
What's there to be?
MORIBUND IRREVERENCE
What's there for us in this deranged society?
Insanity
CADAVEROUS MASTICATION
SATURDAY
They have saturday
SATURDAY
Now it's saturday
SATURDAY
They have saturday
SATURDAY
Now it's saturday
YOU ARE INSANE
How can you let there be such cruelty
YOU ARE INSANE
Now it's time for you to see
Here we are to stay
We all can see the purblind day
Assail the cause
Defray the ogre, the insubordinates
Restrained to live
Bring me home
Confronting mutants
We are bound to fall
We are bound to fall
