Dismantling the clockwork that makes me the cynic
Pallet, wheel and click
The properties of my indifference
Reverse-engineering what makes it tick
Dissecting the fine-tuned mechanism
Rack and barrel, spring and pin
Its synchronous characteristics
To kill what makes it spin
Disassemble this machinery
Re-program these eyes, undo this design
Labelled and filed, each part indexed
Broken to pieces then thoroughly burned
Deconstruction of what I am
Buried to make sure he never returns
Taken apart, defused
Blueprints turned to ashes
Eradicate the last remains
Remnants of the insane
Disintegration
The destruction of me
Now imperative
To purge myself
Of this condition
Complete this dissolution
A necessity
Break
Break
Break
This deceitful machine
A lie, what once I was
Obsolete instrument
An outmoded contraption
A malfunctioning device
That callous self now extinguished
That malignant self now disused
That conceited invention
To nothing now reduced
Complete disintegration
The destruction of me
Now imperative
To purge myself
Of this condition
Complete this dissolution
A necessity
Break
Break
Break
This deceitful machine
