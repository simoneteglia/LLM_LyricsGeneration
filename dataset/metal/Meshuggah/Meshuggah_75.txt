Assembled from dead, incompatible pieces
Livid fragments regenerated
Decomposing bits of organic matter brought to life, revived
A liquid, limbless, sickening shape
A faltering semi-floating cluster
Its sole purpose of creation
To burst the imagination blood surge
Defying the mould of human flesh
Smashing the wall of beliefs
A sight to bring insanity to all dimensional reality
Carved from thoughts unthought
Into a graphic, visible delusion of life
A twisted display of dehumanized features
By cells reflected, refracted
A frantic dancing of particles in pathetic attempt at rendering flesh
Swirling to project the illusion of shape, dimension, and mass
A walking translucent entity
Void, suspended
Inviolate by our rules
All standards of existence
An electrified vapor-cloud
A skein of bone and tissue
An atrocity
A liquid form unshaped to the organic norm
A mind not filled with thoughts
But a random, flickering static
A soulless creature un-alive
I'm the un-human elastic
