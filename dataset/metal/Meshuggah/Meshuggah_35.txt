Insectine man, carnivore, the shape of us, the conduct of flies
All-consuming swarm in inconspicuous disguise
Bloodseeking, parasitic. Ecstatically tracing decay
Thriving in the glow that death emits, the warm perfume it radiates
Revolting conformity, hive mind unity
Excitedly their mandibles grind, aroused by vile ambition
At the sickly sweet promise of decomposition
Deliriously ingesting, liquefied ruin absorbed
Innocence devoured by the elated horde
They are us, let's not even pretend
Aroused and frenzied they scurry, encircling death
A vile swarm awaiting the final breath
Myriad eyes visualizing the end
Blackened skies, rabid heavens descend
On the bereft, unforgivingly
Precious life debased, our dipteran legacy embraced
Crack the shell, ascend the sky
Rise, extend your palpitating wings
Crack the shell, ascend the sky
Fly, you disgraceful wretched things
