[Unofficial lyrics]
A great harm under seeking violence
The perceiving threat of fear and pain
Sanitizing the human flesh
Cities remaining will burst in flames
Don't think they'll limit mutilation
Or contain their distilling vision
About the only currency of the trade of human souls
The managing of machines gone mad
Nature stopped; done by our hands
Fading memories of defeat
If you hear the sirens you better wait out the WAR!
WAAAR!
Some solved their issues
Some are resolved we gladly give our rotting soul
To made up castles of belligerence
Kill thyself, the Anti-Christ
[Guitar Solo]
Fed into the tomb; innate machinery
Acid tossed to channel their thoughts
And to give them up to our skulls
Lights are all that we got left
Slashing into the human thought
And it's guided by ill-direct - this how I wander into WAR!
Meeting our ends to sharpened lies
A poison will stop seeds in fertile ground
Humiliation in our side brain
As we all deform in the... swarming nascent WAR!
Living, breathing suicide!
Still we stare indifferently, waiting for reality!
