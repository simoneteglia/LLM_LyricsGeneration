[Verse 1: Tomas Haake]
Listen to the hidden tune
The essence of lies in notes defined
As we dance to the dissonant sway
The choreography refined
Will subdued and shackled
Reason washed aside
Pledging our love to the chains
Our ignorance ever-amplified
[Chorus: Jens Kidman]
Bloodened hands lead the waltz
We're trapped in the out-of-tune swirl
Still we set the show on continue mode
And dance to a discordant system
[Verse 2: Tomas Haake]
We accept the nails we're fed
Lies sharpened to bleed us silent
Muted from the pains
Defiance employed in vain
Any attempts to leave the dance
Invisibly suppressed
Questions unasked, we learn the steps
Eyes shut like all the rest
Unsuspecting, willing, blind, controllable herd
Pawns in a covert game conducted by hands we trust
Dominated, compliant and deceptable
Confident that we matter - we don't see that we're but dust
[Chorus: Jens Kidman]
Committed to a lie we cannot see, cannot know nor comprehend
We're all asinine drones kept in the dark, kept in line
[Jens Kidman]
Confined, bereft of reason
Withering in toxicity
The deadly fumes of deceit
And we all reek of complicity
Humbled, brought to our knees
By the weight of our own guilt
Our nescient ways the catalyst
To injustice and inhumanity
We dance - to appease
Compete in stupidity
Obscured faces file our points
Numbers fed to the machine
Still we stand in line for the next show
The human spine liquefied
What are we, but stupefied
Dancers to a discordant system
We believe - so we're misled
We assume - so we're played
We confide - so we're deceived
We trust - so we're betrayed
[Instrumental break]
We believe - so we're misled
We assume - so we're played
We confide - so we're deceived
We trust - so we're betrayed
