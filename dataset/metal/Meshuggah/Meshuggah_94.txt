An even stobe a pulse of flashing
Hatelights of synthetic souls massproduced
Hammered into shape a sign of times dreams
Turn into systems a new way a new breed
Implanted in our minds
(Here I am) in the hand of a (sterile hate)
The new control I (can not wake)
I'm not a sleep
New intelligence arise in emptied bodies
Turgid flesh tested through eternal exestince
Do not know codes mother machine
Genocide now scorn a dying race
Evolution (in reverse) now it's time for me
(Changing) what am I to be
(Contorted), an (eternity defeated)
Programmed to appease you
We're symbols of perfection
Humanoids runed by your laws:
"Destroy erase improve"
Lesson first:
Submission we're docile servant dogs
Our leashes are your limbs
Computed deep within
((SOLO))
Remoted minds controlled our thoughts
No More doubts the new way is here disgorged
Another thousands fakes that obey to a
Circuit skin to vacuum
Mechanical-thoughts I-now-concieve
No-longer-me, always-to-see, inanity-millions
To-be-units, like me eternally
Human-patterns, copied-dissected-distorted
Completed-to-fit-the-machine
The-nerve fibres-give-in-to-cords
To-the-unknown
See me be me same contents same machine
(The currency) of ours no more (flesh and bone)
We are to (be unaware) of what we have been before
Evolution (in reverse) now it's time for me
(Changing) what am i to be (contorted)
An eternity (defeated) by a new machine
