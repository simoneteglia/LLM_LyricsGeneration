I'm a carnal, organic anagram
Human flesh instead of written letters
I rearrange my pathetic tissue
I incise, I replace, I'm reformed
I eradicate the fake pre-present me
Elevate me to a higher human form
The characters I am
Made into a word complete
Then I'll be the new norm
Self-inflicted fractures
I replace my bones with bars
Aluminum bleeding oxide
The drug of gods into my pounding veins
My receiving eyes exchanged with fuses
Blindness induced to prevent destruction
Ceramic blades implanted past my ribs
To save me from the dues of inhalation
I tear my worthless, useless skin
Staples to pin it over my ears
Non-receptive of ungodly sounds
I disable the audio-generators of fear
Hexagonal bolts to fill my mouth
Sharpened to deplete
The creator of all violence
Without speech there will be no deceit
Baptized in vitriolic acid
A final touch, a smoothing of features
Completion of the greatest art
To cast the godly creatures
Humans, once astray, made divine
Stripped of congenital flaws
We're incandescent revelations in a world of darkened forms
Disciples
Come join with me
To save a failed humanity
Follow the god of cyanide into the new eternity
Behold, a sacrificial race
In cleansing worshipping of pain
The new millennium Christ
Here to redeem all from lies
Lies
