[Verse 1]
I feel torn apart
A vile misfit fallen
Deep into affliction of my hollow mind
The senses of suffocation grows inside my lungs
When I wake into truth, I'm back among the blind
[Chorus 1]
The truth of lies disenchanting my eyes
How can I survive?
I can't stand being alive
Alive
[Bridge]
Gods of rapture
Enshrouding my eyes
I try to hide
Then slowly I die
Die
[Verse 2]
My past laugh at me from the other side of negation
Untying the lasting few cords of common sense
Submerged into the flow
The rapids of addiction
Too weak to push it back
A worm without defense
[Chorus 2]
My flesh fading, undressing the bones
Behold me
Naked, cadaver exposed
This, my abuse, I can't take it no more
No more
[Outro]
The fragile truth
Sneering at me
With teeth pressed like thrusting nails
Into my head
All my life I regret
