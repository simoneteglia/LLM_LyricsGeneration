[Verse 1]
Beams of fire sweep through my head
Thrusts of pain increasingly engaged
Sensory receptors succumb
And now I know all the agony
My crimson liquid so frantically spilled
The ruby fluid of life unleashed
[Verse 2]
Ripples ascend to the surface of my eyes
Their red pens drawing at random, at will
A myriad pains begotten in their wake
The bastard spawn of a mutinous self
The regurgitation of my micro nemesis
Salivating red at the prospect of my ruin, my doom
[Bridge 1]
Malfunction--the means for its ascent
Bloodletting--the stringent voice to beckon my soul
[Bridge 2]
So futile, any resisting tension
As death-induced mechanics propel its growth
[Verse 3]
The implement, the device of my extinction
The terminating clockwork of my gleeful bane
The definitive scourge of its mockery
The end-art instruments lethality attained
[Chorus]
Heed--it commands, heed my will
Bleed--it says, bleed you will
[Verse 4]
Falling into the clarity of undoing
Scornful gods haggle for my soul
Mind's eye flickers and vellicates as I let go
Taunting whispers accompany my deletion
[Outro]
A sneering grin, the voice of my reaper
Chanting softly the song of depletion
