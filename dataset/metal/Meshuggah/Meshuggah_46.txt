Subdued and repressed
A son of the vortex in faceless progress
Coaxing, tugging, grinding
So elevated, so god
Refit this vessel of confusion to bring the eloquence of the mute
Incorporate this forfeit cause
Assimilate and fake it mine
I bow my head and taste the lies that i'm fed
All to claim my reward
Master and servant
One for all and all for none
Ignorant to the distant hymns of chaos
The progressive stand before me
Their eyes fixed in the distance
Default to conform to the new
They animate me
In confidence i thrive
My reign: supremacy
I speak no word unheard
Re-motivate me
I'm all there is to be
An omnipotent being so complete in my diversity
Ripples race across across my eyes
Breaking out in acid sweat
Wills shrivel and crack
Disintegration of my inner self
I find the substance lost
A shed shell
A being of disgust
Done is the cleansing
Complete is the surgery of the soul
Step inside and taste the shackling thoughts that devour all confidence
Realizing i'm lost
Being no more than a mutt with a fake pedigree
Stillborn soul shaped and molded
I can live an eternity in a minute's time
A borrowed talent filled with copied goals
The carcass of hope lies dead beneath the fabric of dreams
Facing the truth within the mirror of souls
Ha ha!
This is what i've become
Always been in this emancipated state
Battered and numb
Just a mindscape fit for illusion to make fear into reign and fulfillment of pain
Kneeling in permanent solitude
The minions of inside claim me
Re-animate me
'Cause i was once alive
Defeat smears out my focus
Consciousness subsides
Unmotivated
Beheld by scorching eyes
Infinity stares back at me
The surging darkness coils to strike
