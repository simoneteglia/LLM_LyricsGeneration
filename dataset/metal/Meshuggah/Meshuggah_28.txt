[Verse 1]
How come I shiver, hurt and bleed
If in dreams I cannot truly feel
Who would dare say, who would claim
This hallucination isn't real
[Verse 2]
Synaptical glitch looking glass
So enticing, real and free of lies
Prodigious, omnifarious
It nourishes, it feeds my starving eyes
[Bridge]
Artificial the catalyst, organic its progeny
Voracious spectral offspring - so sweet in its hunger
Unbound this new vision, optical regenesis
Threatening, so complete in beautiful deformity
[Verse 3]
These authoritive visions order my collective senses
My questioning, doubtful, rigid self to kneel
A Judas syndrome in effect - former self the deceiver
Its denial the wretched kiss that kept this in disguise
[Verse 4]
Cast off - the concealing veil, the rational cloak of doubt
Torn off - the restraints, the blinded's shackles
Burned away - the agony, the fear, true grief
A new set of eyes cleansed by a new belief
