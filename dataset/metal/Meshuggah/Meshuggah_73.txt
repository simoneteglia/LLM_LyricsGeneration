The most eloquent confession, your silence
The most admitting trait, your turning away
Avert your eyes and hush your struggling thoughts
Detachment assumed as life mutates into decay
The most manifest sign, your disregard
The one apparent fault, your shunning of care
Contempt now bred, refed and well sustained
Division now groomed, nurtured and well maintained
Apathy, opprobrium
Virulence and animosity
This sums you up
Betrayal, disunion and fear, isolation
Caught in this endless spiral, locked equilibrium
A stasis founded in this atrophy of thought
Your eyes unflinching, unaffected by the misery
Gone is commiseration, gone is any sympathy
One last farewell to perspicacity
Final surrender to futility
Dissociating, severance
What have you done?
What have you become?
