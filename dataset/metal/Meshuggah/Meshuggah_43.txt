Iridescent to the searching eyes
I'm all things vivid in a world of grey
So easily spotted, so easily claimed in this domain where all is prey
My thoughts a radiant beacon to the omnidirectional hunter-god radar
I'm a markerlight of flesh to these subconscious carnivores
I am them
I am teeth
I'm their arousal at the kill
Feasting on self
A schizoreality warp
The contradiction fulfilled
Focus the only means to see me back
To life's unending swirl
A reversal of passing away, as the world of dead
As away is now my origin
