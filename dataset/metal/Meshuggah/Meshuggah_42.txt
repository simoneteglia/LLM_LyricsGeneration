The feeding frenzy of my starving soul
Gnawing voraciously at the bones
The exo-skeletal patchwork protecting my own reflection within
The twin and same engaged in the mirrored act
Of chewing away at the shell of my attacking self
The paradox unseen
Treacherous
This deceit to make no choice matter
To have and yet lose yourself
Until finally all reasons why are forgotten
To live through ones own shadow
Mute and blinded
Is to really see
Eclipse the golden mirror
And the reflection is set free
