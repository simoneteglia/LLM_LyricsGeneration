Lacerating pains of degeneration speed through your trembling mind
Still, in machine-like strife you gain another mile
The temporary elusive goal
To reach the solace,
to feed once more upon the synthetic reaper of loss
No matter the outcome, the cost
Cold and stinging needs tearing through the halls
Of your defiled, flesh made temple with its closing walls
Still you claim the worshipers pose and you bow
You kneel
Control, once superior, now a docile pet at chaos's feet
Pulling the leash as it trails the scent to where all hurt recedes
Your past a blurry patch in mind, your future once, now thin dreams filed
Toward the lights of need you strive to drink into your vein the shine
Beaten to the unforgiving ground
Lashed into submission by the inner starving demon, by its unrelenting hand
Still you claim the worshipers pose and you bow
You kneel to the syringe
Answering only to authorities of sedation
Their calls the only ones heeded
A worn out soldier touched by their contagion
A battered drone at their feet
You're the one betrayed
An outcast set afire by your inner war
Your burning self so far astray
A combustion fanned from within your core
