Mechanical compound eye
Imposed observance, sentries in the sky
Vigilant lenses, objectives belied
In blackened heavens covertly they hide
They see you, they see all, they know all indiscretions
Compiler of your dreams, your indignations
Following your every single move
They see you
All-seeing instrument, supreme perception
Omnifocal accumulator
Thief of integrity, its gaze upon the blind
Information divinity by man designed
The lives of all they occupy, their eyes in dismal gloom
The all-piercing, dead oculi, mirrors of our doom
Oblivious to the trespass as you gaze into the black
The demon of surveillance insultingly staring back
Into you
Into you
They own your every secret, your life is in their files
The grains of your every waking second sifted through and scrutinized
They know your every right, they know your every wrong
Each put in their due compartment, sins where sins belong
They know you, they see all, they know all indiscretions
Compiler of your dreams, your indignations
Following your every single move
They know you
