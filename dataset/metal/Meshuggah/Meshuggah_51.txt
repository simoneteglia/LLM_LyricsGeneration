End this debate, no need to dream of solace
I'll be your truth in this game that is life
Your will withering away
Among the comatose but insight's not your fate
Minds align to fire the sequence
You will feel the knife as it turns
Taste visions of ruin and thirst
Make for save haven but I will find you first
Capitulate, you know this fight is over
Spiritual flesh, my stomach starts to churn
A perfected mindjack, confirmed illusion
Euphoric state, you gag, you choke
Words, virus, they echo in your ears
True bliss through bondage and oh here come the tears
I find my joy in fear
A soul cadaver I'm the hurt that finds you first
Capitulate
Hide, you'll be mine either way
Grind my teachings on the soulless
In a sense, devastations structure bleeding through my sermon
The repose of true angels paves my way to power
Parasite a state of which you'll be proud
Under my soothing shroud
Innocence?
This systems roaring howl
Deafens all reason
Questions reduced to silence
