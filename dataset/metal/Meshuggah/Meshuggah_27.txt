I'm the shallow, the superficial, I'm the common man
Faithless, narrow-minded
Indifferent, impassive
A sycophantic leech
Tantamount to disintegrity
I'm the vulture feeding on malignancy
I'm the sin, the lecherous sneering at prostration
I wallow in disease, I rejoice at degradation
I yawn at misery, spit at others' happiness
An advocate of manipulation, I embrace the sickening
I'm the lost, I'm average
I'm common
I'm infection, I'm human
I'm common
A worm thriving in seas of disgust
I'm common
The mouth licking what you've bled
I'm common
I'm the pampered degenerate
I indulge my inclinations
The only words to my attention
Are those that I myself create
Disorder
Chaos
I debar all order, repudiate all purity
Infatuated by contentment
I laugh at lies
Come behold the sickness in my common human eyes
I'm the greed, the cynic, I'm the indifferent gaze
Mendacity, betrayal, this is not a phase
Ebullient with human filth, here I am, here I stay
Flourishing in our disgrace, blessed be the human way
