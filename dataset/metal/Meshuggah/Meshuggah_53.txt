Cry if you need to, disguise, evade, hide
Run 'til you hit water, then swim
Murder in your wake, plan, commit, exact
You have earned our rage, now fly
Beg if you have to, trade away your pride
Run 'til you hit ground, then dig
Death in your wake, those fantasies enacted
You will learn that our rage won't die
You will surely pay the ultimate price
There is no way you will escape our retribution
It will not matter how long it takes
You took them from us so we will take you
Do you believe that luck will somehow stand you by?
Do you really think our resolve will wane?
Do you really think that it will dissipate?
We will haunt you, we will come for you
To collect on what you owe to us
Eye for eye, life for life
Only payment in full can end this strife
