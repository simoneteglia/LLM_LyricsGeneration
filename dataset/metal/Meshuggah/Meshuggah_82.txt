The glued-on sheet of self control
The pity of sense, of sanity
Cracking at the seams
Torn from my reality
The motion of thoughts subdued
Overcome, suppressed by terror
The mouth of fear overfed by dread beyond measure
Pounding waves of overload
Running through my every nerve
Will reduced to nothingness
My system overturned
My mind resigns to defeat
Internal razors activated
Slashing through unprocessed thought
The severance of self complete
Heartbeats hammering at the sight
A revelation to wrap my soul in fear
Blinded by the neverlight
As I stare into my organic shadow
The bin of repressed emotions crammed
Limits of pain by far exceeded
I stare into the blank
The mantra of dead silence repeated
Hear me
Find me
Save me
The dead me
This hell of vacuum abound
With the chanting whispers of the mute
Exposed to the wrath of neversound
The words of my organic shadow
