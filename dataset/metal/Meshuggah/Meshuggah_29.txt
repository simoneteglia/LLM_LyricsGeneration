Unbound to the pale and lifeless day by the multicolored, multiform
A spinning antidream unthought
Exceeding the obsolete reality
Overheated inner shape-generator
Blowing every cerebral fuse
Insanity filtered and systematized
Feeding the tools of mind abuse
Mind-signal transmission peaked, distorted, bent
Unrestrained neuroreceivers short-circuit
System parameters over-gained
Nervethreads decoding the stream of the reality-inverting revolution
The patterned untruth of non-dream: The closed eye visual delusion
A frantic cellular race down the switchbacks of mind
Throttling the existence-engine
A propulsion beyond all limit lines
Convulsive thrusts of septic energy as infected cells collide
Unleashing the video-bacterial disease, the sinew-conducted pseudo-vision
Mind-signal transmission peaked, distorted, bent
Unrestrained neuroreceivers short-circuit
System parameters overgained
Nervethreads decoding the stream of the reality-inverting revolution
The patterned untruth of non-dream: The closed eye visual delusion
Self unfolds like a disintegrating dream
All revealed but the sinister cause
My lying eyes come apart at the seams
Still how could I ever regret the loss
The self transformed into wave lengths
Reverberating this unyielding dream
Lost in this greedy illusion
I'm forever devoured by the closed eye visual delusion
A twirling visual overload
Explosions of terror and beauty
Colors of fear and pain within clash into unanything
