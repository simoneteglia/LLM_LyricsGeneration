[?] on the molten maggots
Earth's on our head
We're only looking at the suffering as more than ourselves
While doing nothing about it
Determined or stupid
They are altering the earth
[?]
It's all a lie
[?] come on here inside
And [?]
The limited fuse must be frayed
This insanity
Determined or stupid
They are altering the earth
We scale the walls again
Who fought it all?
We're dreaming about
Telling fucking lies!
Together, the lies
Everybody dies!
Leave terror on the revolting maggots, inside
We're only looking at the suffering, destroying ourselves
While doing nothing about it
Determined or stupid
They are altering the earth
[?]
It's all a lie
We're dreaming about
Telling fucking lies!
We're shouting somehow
Everybody dies!
Fear, fear
We're living in [?] yeah
Swear, swear
Raise [?] to me
Swear
