On the throne sits the snake
Coiled and irate
Self-righteous
Unforgiving
Lies lining the fork of his tongue, drip from his fangs
Inflicting wounds that never mend
Omnipotent God he sees in mirrors
Seraphic
From atop the growing tower of our bones
Indifferently condemning all
At his whim our dismal fate
From his mouth but venomous gall
Ophidian
Slithering
Deceitful serpentine
Illustrious morph of man
Despot in guise of savior
Any blame he will carelessly relinquish
Like shedding his skin
Ophidian
Slithering
Decеitful
Through the vast of death he causеd he winds
Serpentine
Never again shall we suffer the hissing
The subversive, malicious lies lining the fork of his tongue
Drip from his fangs Inflicting wounds that never mend
Omnipotent God he sees in mirrors
