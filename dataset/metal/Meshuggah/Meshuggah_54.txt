From the realms of past my demons howl
Beyond bridges I lit they learned to fly
Apparitions
These ghosts of distant memory
Specters
Remnants that just will not die
All my wrongs
My indiscretions they carry
From across the boundaries of time
The burdens I left for them to hold
Presented
Laid out before my eyes
In their frozen gaze the blame
The questions to my lies
How hard I have tried to bury this
Yet here they stand before me
Phantoms
