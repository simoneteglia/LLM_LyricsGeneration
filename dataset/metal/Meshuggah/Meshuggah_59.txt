[Unofficial lyrics]
[Verse 1: Tomas Haake]
The soul: burned, hard, cracked
A take on these events was reality perceived through flashes of heat, on repeat
Depleted from spoken stabs
Treachery, black controls
The inner flames fanned by the ever distant source
The second wave will break the barrier sent to the humanity
Body unbalanced, senses numbing
Forever to seal my own horror
The thousands of venomous thoughts are kept in
Forgotten by illumination, darkness is all there is
Welcome, come, defy your fears
I dare you tread this metal ground
Unleashed in a livid sun, step into my oblivion
Come and walk this static ground
Feel free, scan this nothingness
Unleash a fitted sun, stepping to oblivion
[Verse 2: Tomas Haake]
An incarnation no one can comprehend
Extending their twisted eyes
My own mind heights are in his fears
My instinct continues to scan
Now to the fired disgust as seen by all these American deeds
The misfits of the disgrace forever bound to bleed
Whipped, abused, ridiculed and chained, strapped, embarrassed, bound
Repelled by narrow minded ways, they stay on the perfect human ground
Humiliation floods the scene of a predestined bleak way
The pitch black states, the color shade of my every day
Welcome, come and face your fears
I dare you tread this burning ground
Bask in the light of a mocking sun, step into my oblivion
Come and walk this static ground
Feel free, scan this nothingness
Unleash a fitted sun, stepping to oblivion
