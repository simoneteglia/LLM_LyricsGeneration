A new level reached, where the absence of air lets me breathe
I'm inverted electrical impulses
A malfunctioning death-code incomplete
All things before me, at first unliving glimpse undeciphered
Its semantics rid of logic
Nothing is all
All is contradiction
Grinding, churning - the sweetest ever noises
Decode me into their non-communication
A soundtrack to my failure, one syllable, one vowel
A stagnant flow of endings
Un-time unbound
Merging to form the multi-none
A sickly dance of matter, malignantly benign
Greeting the chasm - unbearable, sublime
