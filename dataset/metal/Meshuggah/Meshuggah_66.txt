Winds that shine a bright, blinding dark
Kerosene flames so cold they crack
Suns that blow becalmed twisters
Ferocity sleeping
Nothingness stacked
Intestines worn to shield the inward limbs
Screams unheard
Deafening thoughts
Levitating ground
The solid water burns
Liquid stone
The immobile turns
Corrosion soothing the hurt within
Surroundings reaching to touch your skin
Progress in stalemate, death is alive
Eyes and mind glint, glints collide
Pains sending shivers of well-being down your spine
Sounds of healing crack your bones
Lamentation carving into smiling faces
Surrounded by everyone, still you're all alone
Wormholes set as halos over sinners' skulls
Leaves chasing the fallen air away
A lifetime of needle-eyes too wide to escape
Where honesty lies and angels betray
Incisions mending the wounds within
Surroundings breach the surface of your skin
Progress in static, life has died
Eyes and mind glint, glints collide
Disorder putting everything back in place
Chaos the obtainer of lucidity
Tranquility created by raging turbulence
Your solid note frequency out of phase
The fractals of your soul - by symmetry abandoned
Confusion calms your overheating mind
You're the memory no one ever had
You're the one thing you will never find
Reincarnation trapped in a life span
Corpses bolted to the ground arise
Omnilights flooding your world with their darkness
As your reflection turns its back to your eyes
You've entered your self-created antiparadise
Your universe processed and trapped in jars
Never ending insanity
Down in the hell of mind, where glints collide
