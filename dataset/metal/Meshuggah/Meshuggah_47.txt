To you a beast you think you comprehend
Not necessarily made all evil
In the reflective pool of your eyes
I see fear and intrigue co-mingle
You hesitate to deem me all bad
Yet when my face is shown, your eyes avert
New thoughts sprout from that fear-filled soil
Your nerves and intuition back on full alert
You think that you've seen the truth, you think you know
Yet disbelief grinds, the doubt it claws
In your sleepless delirium
I devour your thoughts
If you only knew how your way of life sustains me
Like electricity coursing through my soul
Your will to retaliate, your vengeful thoughts announced
I bring you me - conflict and death
And the promise of spilling red by the ton
I just might be there in your final moment
I just might be the last thing your eyes take in
