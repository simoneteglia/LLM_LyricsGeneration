[Verse 1]
No more ifs, no bias, no ambiguity
No wondering whether this is it
Clarity, so brightly shining
The image so painfully absolute
[Verse 2]
No edges blurred on this awareness
No unknown weight to tip the knowledge scales
Eyes dilated to grasp it all
As every illusion of what we are fails
[Verse 3]
An unquestionable picture, determined, complete
Its crystalline lines untouched by doubt
So vivid, so deprived of hesitation
Shining in its evil splendor
[Verse 4]
The burning hatred of man
A million degrees on display
Human voracity delineated
The demons in us all by fumes portrayed
[Bridge]
Stare
See
Take in
Grasp;
Comprehend
Assimilate
Behold your reflection
[Verse 5]
The framing, gold plated lies
The canvas, hurting souls caught and weaved
The artist, the human dream
Incinerated, devoured, deceived
