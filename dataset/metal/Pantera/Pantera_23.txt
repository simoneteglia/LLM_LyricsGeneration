[Verse 1]
A smack on the wrist is the word from the mouth
Of the outsider, lawyer, police
A small price to pay for the dope and the guns and the rape
It should all be okay (okay)
Your father is rich, he's a judge, he's the man
He's the God that got your sentence reduced
But in the back of his mind, he well knows what he'd find
If he looked a little deeper in you, in you
[Chorus]
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more
[Verse 2]
Sweet is the slice and the lips, you're gonna have that woman
She is your favorite lay
Promised you swore that no one had been there
And she was gonna keep it that way
Let it move in, you got thin and got high
And your money went and so did your friends
But she's by your side and her smile cannot hide
The premonition of a beckoning hand, the end
[Chorus]
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more, uh
[Chorus]
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more, yeah
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more
Drag the waters some more
Drag the waters some more
Drag the waters some more
Like never before
Drag the waters some more
