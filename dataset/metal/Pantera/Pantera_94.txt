[Verse 1]
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin
And call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
[Chorus]
Re-spect, walk
What did you say?
Re-spect, walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
[Verse 2]
Run your mouth when I'm not around
It's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
[Chorus]
Re-spect, walk
What did you say?
Re-spect, walk
Are you talking to me?
[Chorus]
Re-spect, walk
What did you say?
Re-spect, walk
Are you talking to me?
[Bridge]
Are you talking to me?
No way, punk!
[Chorus]
Re-spect, walk
What did you say?
Re-spect, walk
Are you talking to me?
[Chorus]
Re-spect, walk
What did you say?
Re-spect, walk
Are you talking to me?
[Outro]
Are you talking to me?
Walk on home, boy
