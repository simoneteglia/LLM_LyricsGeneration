[Verse 1]
You say you want it loud, I'll never turn it down
You wanna feel my power, pound you in the ground
I want to give you fury, blow your head apart
I'll leave you comatose from the very start
[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want some metal
I'll give it all I've got
My deadly grasp is lethal
This force will never stop
[Chorus]
Power metal
Rock forever
Power metal
On forever
[Verse 2]
I am the metal beast, the battle dog I deal
My soul was spawned from hell, my body coiled steel
Put on this Earth to melt it down to the core
I'll make you feel such pain, you're coming back for more
[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want some metal
I'll give you all I've got
My deadly grasp is lethal
This force will never stop
[Chorus]
Power metal
Rock forever
Power metal
On forever
[Hook]
Let's go
[Pre-Chorus]
You say you want my metal
I'll give you all I've got
My deadly grasp is lethal
This force will never stop
[Chorus]
Power metal
Rock forever
Power metal
On forever
[Bridge]
Now!
Power!
Forever!
[Bridge]
Alright!
Alright!
Alright!
[Outro]
We'll take it on
Metal!
