[Verse 1]
Wears ten crowns
Dragons heads
Southern are the sons
Lords unmatched
[Hook]
(Your eyes donâ€™t look right)
(Should they be trusted now?)
[Verse 2]
Trashed-mouth Gods
Avoided kings
With the spirit of revolt
The ghost of youth
[Chorus]
Every fucking year it stays the same
Everybody changes to suit the day
Out of pride I'll isolate my fears
Never turned our backs on why we're here
We'll grind that axe for a long time
[Verse 3]
Follow close
Train of fools
Just like them
Just like you
[Hook]
(Their eyes don't seem right)
[Verse 4]
Easily impressed plague
Dressed up fake
No respect
[Chorus]
Every fucking year remains the same
Everybody sucks up to suit the day
Out of hate I'll isolate myself
Through the worst we still marched into hell
We'll grind that axe for a long time
[Chorus]
We'll grind that axe for a long time
(And I said... yeah)
We'll grind that axe for a long time
(And a-fuckin'-gain, I'll say...)
We'll grind that axe for a long time
(The smell in the air is chicken shit)
[Bridge]
We'll grind that axe for a long time
We'll grind that axe for a long time
We'll grind that axe
We'll grind that axe
We'll grind that axe for a long time
[Chorus]
Every fucking song remains the same
To everyone who sucks up for the fame
Out of strength you know we speak the truth
Every trend that dies is living proof
We'll grind that axe for a long time
