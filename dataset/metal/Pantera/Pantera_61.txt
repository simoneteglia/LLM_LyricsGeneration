[Refrain]
Pussy tight, tonight
Pussy tight
[Verse 1]
Just keep it coming, just keep me pleased
If you know what's good for you
You'll be looking for me
I know you know I can please
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, yes last night was crazy
(Got in a fight, Saturday night)
But tonight
(Now you're gonna make it right)
(Slip and dance with me all night)
[Refrain]
Pussy tight, tonight
Pussy tight
Alright!
[Verse 2]
Coors light on ice
She's getting quiet, she's feeling my rise
Don't stop, roll dice
She's got my rod in the thighs
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yes, tonight feels crazy
Hoping for tight, you know it might
Call it a date, I can't fuckin' wait
As she pumps, it feels right
I can hang all night
[Refrain]
Pussy tight, tonight
Pussy tight, alright!
[Hook]
(I can hang all night)
[Lead: Darrell]
[Refrain]
Pussy tight, tonight
Pussy tight
[Verse 3]
Loose will occur
When the puss starts to purr
You know what you are
You fuck us so hard
