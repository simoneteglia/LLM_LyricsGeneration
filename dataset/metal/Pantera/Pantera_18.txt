[Verse 1]
Now a new look in my eyes, my spirit rise
Forget the past, present tense works and lasts
Got shit on, pissed on, spit on, stepped on, fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men
[Pre-Chorus]
New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials
[Chorus]
A new level
Of confidence
And power
[Verse 2]
Demanding plea for unity between us all
United stand, death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar power, impatient because time is shorter
[Pre-Chorus]
New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials
[Chorus]
A new level
Of confidence
And power
[Solo]
That's right
[Bridge]
(Submit to drive) Can't lose
(Surrender to [?]) No fucking surrender
([?] raining down on you) Can't lose
(No respect gets no one nowhere) No fucking surrender
(Show respect) Can't lose
Whoa
[Chorus]
A new level (New level)
Of confidence (Of confidence)
And power (Such power)
[Chorus]
A new level (New level)
Of confidence (Of confidence)
And power (And power)
[Outro]
Life kills
Life kills
Life kills
Life kills
