[Verse 1]
Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale
The pills that kill and take the pain away (Take the pain away)
Diet of life, shelter without
The face that cannot see inside yours and mine (Yours and mine)
[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm hiding
When I need it, it lets me breathe
For our handle on this life
I don't believe this time
[Chorus]
Would you look at me now? (Would you look at me now?)
Can you tell I'm a man? (Can you tell I'm a man?)
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again
[Post-Chorus]
Try to die again
Try to live through this night
Try to die again
[Verse 2]
Forever fooling, free and using
Sliding down the slide that breaks a will (Breaks a will)
Mother's angel, getting smarter
How smart are you to regress unfulfilled?
(How smart are you to regress unfulfilled?)
It's a damn shame
[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm hiding
When I need it, it lets me breathe
For our handle on this life
I don't believe this time
[Chorus]
Would you look at me now? (Would you look at me now?)
Can you tell I'm a man? (Can you tell I'm a man?)
With these scars on my wrists (With these scars on my wrists)
To prove I'll try again (To prove I'll try again)
[Chorus]
Would you look at me now? (Would you look at me now?)
Can you tell I'm a man? (Can you tell I'm a man?)
With these scars on my wrists (With these scars on my wrists)
To prove I'll try again (To prove I'll try again)
[Post-Chorus]
Try to die again
Try to live through this night
Try to die again
