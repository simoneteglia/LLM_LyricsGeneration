[Verse 1]
Eliminate...
The life decline
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
(And it's not for sale by any stretch)
It's like religion without a Bible
(And the dragon lives inside of my mouth)
(And it speaks in tongues to the world)
[Chorus]
Hellbound in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound in Fort Worth
[Verse 2]
Snakes...
In Southern flames
To bring the thunder, the great decider
(Would you believe in this or the ash?)
I do believe it, it's taking over
Accept...
[Chorus]
Hellbound in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound in Fort Worth
[Verse 3]
Born to a world so young and proud
But over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself
Because there you cannot hide
Facing fears that you'll overcome
And one of these years you know you've won...
You've won, you've won
You've won, you've won
[Chorus]
Hellbound in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound
Fort Worth
