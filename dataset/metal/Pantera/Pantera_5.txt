[Intro]
(First take like a motherfucker)
[Verse 1]
Agony is the price that you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you, then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget when there's nothing else left to destroy
It's a useless ploy
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall
[Chorus]
It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination
Yeah
[Verse 2]
A now blacked heart is reaching out in divinity
Bodies suspended by chains over razors and nails
It's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail marks demise of your life
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick?
Sealed you in brick by brick till your end
Forcing you to bend
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall
[Chorus]
It's domination pushed into living hell
Oh, domination
[
Instrumental Outro/Guitar Solo]
