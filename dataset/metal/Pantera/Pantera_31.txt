[Verse 1]
As a child, I was given
The gift to entertain you
But through blood, I inherited
A life that could destroy you
[Pre-Chorus]
I drink all day, I smoke all day
I took Madonna's breath away
I've done it all but tap the vein
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
Are textbook reasons
All these Christians come alive
And try to sell you
[Chorus]
My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old
[Verse 2]
You know it's bad, some may say "sad"
A hangover is inspiration
Like a junkie, I hurt for it
A bad trip, the emptiness
[Pre-Chorus]
I never sleep, or I always sleep
A lack of fulfillment to me is me
The big picture
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
Are part of what the Christians mean
To immortalize my situation
[Chorus]
My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old
[Bridge]
(Simply to thy ghost, I cling)
Simply to thy ghost, I cling
(Simply to thy ghost, I reject)
Simply to thy ghost, I reject
(Simply to thy ghost, I spit at)
Simply to thy ghost, I spit at
(Simply to thy ghost ugly)
Simply to thy ghost ugly
(And I reject)
And I reject
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Tempter, tempting
Tempt me, molest me
You know that I'll submit
For this is my weakness
And it saves me from relationships
With those Christians
You know they'll sell you
[Chorus]
My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old
[Instrumental Outro]
