[Verse 1]
There's a place that I keep deep inside me
It can trigger my mind
All along I knew it has been with me
Since I was just a child
I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life, beyond life
I take blame for my murderous problem
My signature always reminds
[Chorus]
It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken ending to life
[Verse 2]
I'm provoked into sick confrontations
Brutal time after time
Bed of nails, suffocation, life's ending
Slay in different designs
One man's misery is another man's mystery
No one cares to understand my demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your brittle bones
Epitaph written at your feet
[Chorus]
It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken ending to life
[Solo]
[Chorus]
It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken ending to life
[Refrain]
Message in blood, message in blood
Message in blood, message in blood
