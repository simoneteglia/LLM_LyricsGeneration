[Verse 1]
Understanding what has happened before us
We are confined to a darkened hidden tomb
The conquering of our world as we knew it
Rise above this pit of sorrow and pain
Among the few we are the avant leaders
We've got to live through this trouble and decay
[Chorus]
This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?
[Verse 2]
Unsure and scared we are planning our reprise
Revolves around this world we don't know anymore
The odds against us yet we're stronger and prevailing
Learn from mistakes counting souls for sale
[Chorus]
This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive?
This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?
