[Verse 1]
Full of grief I scream at the wind
Thought I heard the words of others
Imprison myself and stay in a shell
I won't let you in to have a story to tell
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Things tend to drag me down
Don't understand so they hate me now
[Chorus]
My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone
[Verse 2]
I promised myself somewhere in teenage life
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like
Live in a hole but stay close to my kind
'Cause they understand what burns in my mind
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I still feel incomplete
Friends are few and far between
[Chorus]
My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone
[Solo]
[Chorus]
My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone
[Outro]
My fear grips me
My fear grips me
