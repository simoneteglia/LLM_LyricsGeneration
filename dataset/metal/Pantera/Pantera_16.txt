[Verse 1]
I fucked your girlfriend last night
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love
She called me Daddy
And I called her baby when I smacked her ass
I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight
And I slept with her all over me
From forehead to rib cage, I dripped her ass
Sometimes, I thought you might be spying
Living out some brash fantasy, but no
You were knocked out
But we were all knocked out, you know
In a way
[Chorus 1]
I'm out of my fucking mind
I serve too many masters
[Verse 2]
We didn't know you'd break this bottle open
That the magic came in to use those jagged shards
To cut our wrists and neck
And you'd do it, too; you're that kind of dude
But you wouldn't know what you were doing
Because I didn't
Your girlfriend could have been a burn victim
An amputee, a dead body
But, goddamn, I wanted to fuck
[Chorus 2]
I'm losing what's left of my fucking mind
I serve too many fucking masters
I fucking told you
I'm losing that fucking every fucking bit
(I'll fucking kill you)
Of my motherfucking mind, you fuck
[Outro]
I told you
I told you, motherfucker
