[Verse 1]
A long time ago, I never knew myself
Then the memory of shame birthed its gift
No more the small one, the weak one, the frightened one
Running from beatings, deflating
I'm becoming more than a man
More than you ever were
Driven and burning to rise beyond Jesus
[Chorus]
I'm born again with snake's eyes
Becoming God-size
[Verse 2]
I found my life was slipping through my hands
Perhaps through death, my life won't be so bad
I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you
Staring through your eyes
Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me
To realize my saving grasp
I of suicide, I the unlord
[Chorus]
I'm born again with snake's eyes
Becoming God-size
Yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I'm born again with snake's eyes
Becoming God-size
God-size!
God-size!
