[Verse 1]
Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you, what do I do?
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am
Where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
[Chorus]
Respect
Walk
What did you say?
Respect
Walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
[Verse 2]
Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear the violins playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am
Where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time
[Chorus]
Respect
Walk
What did you say?
Respect
Walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect
Walk
What did you say?
Respect
Walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
No way, punk
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Respect
Walk
What did you say?
Respect
Walk
Are you talking to me?
Respect
Walk
What did you say?
Respect
Walk
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
[Outro]
Walk on home, boy
