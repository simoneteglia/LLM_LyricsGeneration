[Verse 1]
I've trampled on that road, that you think you own
You have that "smart ass" attitude
It's time to stop the fiction
I live it every day, while your mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing, hard time is coming
My time, your pain, I reign on you
[Chorus]
You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own
[Post-Chorus]x2
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
[Verse 2]
There's been so many times, you practice in your mirror
To be just like me, but you just can't see
You ain't got the balls, son
I fight for love of brother, your friends fight one another
You can't see, because your head's up your ass
And just in case you think you're bad
I crush your rush, I rule you fool
Immovable stone in your world of weak, I speak
[Chorus]
You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own
[Post-Chorus]x2
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
[Solo]
[Chorus]
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
[Post-Chorus]
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this
[Outro]
Don't fuck with this
