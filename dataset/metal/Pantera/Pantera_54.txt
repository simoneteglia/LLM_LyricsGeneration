[Verse 1]
They warned you about the danger, so be careful
But when I approach, I know what I do
It's 'cause I'm professional, I finish the job
If I throw you my look, you are hypnotized
[Chorus]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
To see my moral
Ay, ay, ay, ay
You are in love
Ay, ay, ay, ay
To see my moral
Ay, ay, ay, ay
You are in love
[Verse 2]
When I want, it will happen
Many questions to ask me
If you'll never see me again
Kill or die, that doubt is yours
With a disguise in the street, I disappear in the moonlight
I know it's tense, I drive you crazy
So much that you ask for help
You know why you don't act, then relax and float
I know you're tense, I drive you crazy
[Chorus]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
To see my moral
Ay, ay, ay, ay
You are in love
Ay, ay, ay, ay
To see my moral
Ay, ay, ay, ay
You are in love
[Bridge]
When I enter, I change the game
I ignite, I set it on fire
I am the danger, delighted
I won't say everything I think
I do the work, better be careful
[Chorus]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
To see my moral
Ay, ay, ay, ay
You are in love
Ay, ay, ay, ay
To see my moral
Ay, ay, ay, ay
You are in love
