[Verse 1]
(Truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly, truly)
Truly fuck the world for all it's worth
Every inch of planet Earth
Fuck myself, don't leave me out
But don't get involved, don't corner me
Inside, ulcer
Unjust bastards
File out, face first
Meet the lies and see what you are
[Chorus]
It's forcing you down
And it's grinding against you
Let the war nerve break
[Post-Chorus 1]
For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and judges what I am in one paragraph
Look here, fuck you all
[Verse 2]
(Expect, expect, expect, expect, expect, expect)
Expect the worse, you bleeding heart
But kill me first before it starts
Yes, my cock is getting hard
We are born different after all
Invite mayhem
Produce weapons
Shoot out, burn down
No CNN or media now
[Chorus]
It's forcing you down
And it's grinding against you
Let the war nerve break
[Post-Chorus 2]
All the money in the fuckin' world couldn't buy me a second of trust or one ounce of faith in anything you're about
Fuck you all
[Bridge]
Nothing is worth the sleep that I've lost
Apologies unacceptable now
A blistered revenge awaits in me
This is fucking loveless
[Outro]
Hate
Hate
Hate
Hate
Hate
Hate
Hate
Hate
Hate mail is not read, in jail instead
Hate
Hate
Hate
Hate
The Lord knows there's worse
Ignore this curse
Ah, ah, ah, fuck you all
