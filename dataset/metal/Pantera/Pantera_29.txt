[Verse 1]
One's own Kingman
Christ person, woman God
At battle with a mass astringent
The bond that blends
The weak to the wise
[Chorus]
It's a safe assumption
That you'd want to save me now
But I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left
Slaughtered
Slaughtered
[Verse 2]
Brainwashed by me
Myself influence I
Birdbrained world-saver
Fake god rests dead inside you
[Chorus]
It's a safe assumption
That you'd want to save me now
But I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left
Slaughtered
Slaughtered
[Bridge â€“ Sung,
Lyrics excluded from Song
]
System destroyed
Exposed and unployed
The fruit of intention
Cry for their dead
But turning their head
To ignore reality's claw
Knife to your wrist
Syringe in your arm
Is your ounce of prevention
Give what you made
And under your name
On your grave is salvation
A big fucking joke
Slaughter the pig
The self-righteous king
For your own restoration
God is in your chest
And faith kills what is precious
For death is unanswered
[Chorus]
Slaughtered
Slaughtered
[Outro]
Do sin
Do sin
Do sin
Do sin
