[Intro]
...dead
[Verse 1]
Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it!
The trend is over and gone forever
Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it
You won't need that anymore
It's on sale at the fucking dollar store!
[Bridge]
Waste of time
Pantomime
Circus doll
At the local mall
Exterminate
It's all fake
Exterminate
It's all fake
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast yourself
Sandblast yourself
[Outro]
It's getting old
