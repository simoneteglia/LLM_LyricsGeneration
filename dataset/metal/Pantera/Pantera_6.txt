[Verse 1]
If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted
Was the keeping of someone like you
As it turns out, deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never ending pain, quickly ending life
[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love
[Verse 2]
I'd been the tempting one stole her from herself
This gift in pain, her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you
I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself
[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love
[Bridge]
No more head trips
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love
[Outro]
You keep this love
You keep this love
You keep this love
You keep this love
