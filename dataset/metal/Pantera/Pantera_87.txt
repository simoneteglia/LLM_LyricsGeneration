[Verse 1]
There is a part of me that's always sixteen
I've found the secret of eternal youth
Some get high on life or money, but there's an escape
Drop out of the race
[Chorus 1]
To walk through the world by oneself
You can't be protected
Your trust is in whiskey and weed and Black Sabbath
It's goddamn electric
[Bridge 1]
Don't waste your time, embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric
[Verse 2]
The weight of the world has lifted and parted
My eyes roll blind to sights that distracted
Through tunnel-vision and dope-hair blinders
I'll cut a path and evoke my will
[Chorus 2]
To walk through the world by oneself
You can't be protected
Your trust is in whiskey and weed and Slayer
It's goddamn electric
[Bridge 2]
Don't fake your life - inhale it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric
[Bridge 1]
Don't waste your time, embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric
Will focus the mind's eye
[Verse 3]
One hand on the bottle, the other a shaking fist
Rejuvenated, isolated, no pressure
From the outside, my sight's goddamn electric
And these eyes have seen a world
Goddamn electric system
[Bridge 1]
Don't waste your time, embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is goddamn electric
