[Verse 1]
Many distant miles away
Past the shores of ever dark
There stays a magic man
Who bears an evil mark
He helps all concerned
Those who come again return
Injecting lies while fires burn
The devil's heart
With angel's words
[Verse 2]
Have you wondered what heaven's like?
He can show you in one night
Overwhelming with euphoric lift
To lure you, to steal your gift
[Pre-Chorus]
Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go
[Chorus]
Understand, just take his hand
He's the medicine man
Understand, just take his hand
He's the medicine man
[Verse 3]
Once proud and fearless men
With desire in their eyes
Lost strong and fruitful lives
To self-indulgent ties
Their souls were dipped in venom
And put into a box
Then placed upon a crowded shelf
Where countless souls now rot
[Verse 4]
Have you ever wondered what hell's like?
He can take you there
Just one taste and you'll be back
And by the high you'll swear
[Pre-Chorus]
Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go
[Chorus]
Understand, just take his hand
He's the medicine man
Understand, just take his hand
He's the medicine man
[Solo]
[Chorus]
Understand, just take his hand
He's the medicine man
Understand, just take his hand
He's the medicine man
[Solo]
