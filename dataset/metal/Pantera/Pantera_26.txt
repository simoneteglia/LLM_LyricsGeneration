[Verse 1]
In the states there's a problem with race
Because of ignorant past burnt fires
From evolution we've been killing each other
I figure man should have it down to a science
No chance, not for a minute, not for a second
I won't be defensive
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'd better listen to a man
Who knows what he's saying
I've seen your side, you run and hide
For the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior and know your interior
[Pre-Chorus]
Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man, no stand
Live in the past, we make it last
A hated mass
No solution, mind pollution
For revolution
[Chorus]
So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good for no-one
You're no good for no-one
[Verse 2]
You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn shows progress is minimal
White hoods and militants, you know it's such a pity
Living, breathing, violence in your city
If one man had one home in one world
He'd live alone without variety, full of anxiety
No-one to point at, question or even talk to in his private grave
No matter what colour, he wouldn't be saved from Hell, he dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells
[Pre-Chorus]
Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man, no stand
Live in the past, we make it last
A hated mass
No solution, mind pollution
For revolution
[Chorus]
So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good for no-one
You're no good for no-one
[Solo]
[Chorus]
So low behold your eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good for no-one
You're no good for no-one
