[Verse 1]
Out of my mind
Gun up to the mouth
No pretension, execution
Live and learn, rape and turn
Fret not family
Nor pre-judged army
This is for me
And me only, cowards only try it
[Chorus]
Don't you try to die
Like me
It's living its lies
And makes graves descending
[Verse 2]
It's not worth the time to try
To replenish a rotting life
I'll end the problem, facing nothing
Fuck you off, fuck you all
Tortured history
Addict of misery
This exposes me
For weakness is a magnet
Watch me do it, do it
[Chorus]
Don't you try to die
Like me
It's livid and it's lies
And makes graves descending down
[Verse 3]
Why would you help anyone who doesn't want it
Doesn't need it, doesn't want your shit advice
When a mind's made up to go ahead and die?
What's done is done and gone, so why cry?
[Bridge]
Tortured history
Addict of misery
This exposes me
For weakness is a magnet
Watch me do it, do it, do it
[Chorus]
Don't you try to die
Like me
It's livid and it's lies
And make graves
Descending down
