[Verse 1]
I've written about my inner wars
But I could give a shit about right now
Most of me is all strength
And all of me is at war with dope
But my eyes are clear in sight
My guts are blazing
I might have a life
[Chorus]
I can't hide, to erase, what I've done
Last year, and three years before
[Verse 2]
It still takes assholes of all kinds
On that fact I am still clear
(Because) I should know and now I do
I'm one of them
I'm just like you
Iâ€™m just like you
A man that stands his ground with strength
[Chorus]
I can't hide, to erase, what I've done
Last year, and three years before
[Bridge]
Can't hide myself
And I won't try
It makes me strong
Makes me strong
Makes me strong
[Outro]
It blows away weakness
It blows away detachment
It blows away the depression inside
It blows away the mental withdrawal
It blows away
