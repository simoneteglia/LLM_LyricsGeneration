[Backwards]
Satan’s wrath is the only choice
His stillborn army is impeccable
Modern day plague
Stronger than any and every virus, disease, or sickness
For a glimpse of ideology
Anti-christian and eternally alive
Or dead
Buried underneath two thousand years
Of histories
Yet able to rise, instinctively arise
Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
True and purely horror
Man's ultimate enemy and predator wrapped into one
Spread black wings of damnated
Then folding into shape a mortal men
Not slaved
Plasmicumber will over-ride
The true emotion
That peering virgin to guard my callussed grave
Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Alone, unseen
Reborn, received
It's a battle of wills
Ingloriously killed
We shall devour
[Solo]
Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
[Backwards]
Satan’s wrath is the only choice
His stillborn army is impeccable
