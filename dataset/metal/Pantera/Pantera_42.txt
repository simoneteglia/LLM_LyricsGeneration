[Refrain 1]
This is feeding what I am
[Verse 1]
It's like salt poured into
A deep, infected wound
It's the type of pain
You really dig and long for
I've always been insecure
To open up and show love
Some pretty girl with long hair
Some bald guy writhing
[Chorus]
Rejection...
The kind that's self-induced
Rejection...
The tongue that's bitten through
Rejection...
The nauseating stab
Rejection...
Is feeding what I am
[Refrain 2]
A short fuse
[Verse 2]
If there really is a God
Then it's punishing me constantly
She let me taste that sugar hole
And, of course, I wanted more
But, no, I'm reduced to a Rohypnol snort
And a lot of drinks
This shit goes on and on
Just look down my pants
[Chorus]
Rejection...
It ain't a fucking game
Rejection...
My human dick to blame
Rejection...
A sociopathic plan
Rejection...
Is feeding what I am
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Rejection...
Takes life away from eyes
Rejection...
Will give you to the skies
Rejection...
It makes me more than a man
Rejection...
Is drowning what I am
[Instrumental Outro]
