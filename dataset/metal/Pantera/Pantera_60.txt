[Verse 1]
The end will crush the light
And sends a message
It won't please the naked eye
Without an end there is no light
To foretell, to blind you
The law of the claw reigns on and after still
[Chorus]
When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow
[Verse 2]
I'm leaving more eyes open
I close up both of mine
For the ones that chase my life
They're looking over shoulders
Let paranoia in
Spontaneously rule them
[Chorus]
When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll fly, I cast a shadow
[Bridge]
Everybody get fucking up!
I... I cast a shadow
I... I cast a shadow
I... I cast a shadow
I... I cast a shadow
[Chorus]
When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow
[Instrumental Outro]
