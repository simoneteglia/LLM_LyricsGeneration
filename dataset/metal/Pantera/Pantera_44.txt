[Verse 1]
There's nothing special about it
It's either there when you're born or not
Gifted with talent or no big deal
Welcome to the death of a century
[Chorus]
'Cause yesterday don't mean shit
What's over is over and nothing between
Yesterday don't mean shit
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face
No rewinding time
Yesterday don't mean shit
Yesterday don't mean shit
[Verse 2]
Reliving old reviews
Is a useless tool of confusion
Don't hold your breath for the turn-around
Come into the world of endless odds!
[Chorus]
'Cause yesterday don't mean shit
What's over is over and nothing between
Yesterday don't mean shit
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face
No rewinding time
Yesterday don't mean shit
Yesterday don't mean shit
[Bridge]
They'll tell you all about guilt
And in time you'll face the darkness
But darkness is a friend to you
Embrace and fly through the madness
[Verse 3]
Flying past God and wars and conflict
Oppression in you
Oppression in you
Plowing through minds and paranoia
Oppression in you
The opressor's in you
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
'Cause yesterday don't mean shit
What's over is over and nothing between
Yesterday don't mean shit
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face
No rewinding time
Yesterday don't mean shit
Yesterday don't mean shit
[Outro]
Yesterday don't mean jack shit
You protect you and I'll keep to myself
It can only be that way
Yeah
