[Verse 1]
I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
While loved ones mourn the day
The absence of our faces
Living, laughing, eyes awake
Is this too much for them to take?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won
Such values you taught your son
[Pre-Chorus 2]
That's how, that's how,
that's how
Look at me now
[Chorus]
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken
[Verse 2]
One day, we all will die
A clich√©d fact of life
Force-fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
Every warning, a leaking rubber
A poison apple for mingled blood
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too young for one's delusion, the lifestyle cost
Venereal mother embrace the loss
[Pre-Chorus 2]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at you now
[Chorus]
You're broken
Inherit your life
You're broken
[Post-Chorus]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at us now
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken
[Post-Chorus]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at me now
[Outro]
I'm broken, broken
I'm broken, broken
I'm broken, broken
I'm broke
