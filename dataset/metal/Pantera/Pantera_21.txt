[Verse 1]
There is nothing
No education
No family life to open my arms to
You'd say that my job is today
Yet gone tomorrow
I'll be broke in a gutter
[Chorus]
I know the opinion
A broken record
Fuck you and your college dream
Fact is we're stronger than all
[Verse 2]
You're working for perfect bodies
Perfect minds and perfect neighbors
But I'm helping to legalize dope
On your pristine streets
And I'm making a fortune
[Chorus]
You're muscle and gall
Naive at best
I'm bone, brain, and cock
Deep down, stronger than all
[Bridge 1]
A sad state of affairs
A crippled America
A pipe dream
Buttfucked
Immune
Stronger than all
[Bridge 2]
We've grown into a monster
An arrogant, explosive motherfuck
Hard as a rock
Shut like a lock
The president in submission
He holds out his hand on your television and
Draws back a stump
It's too late for some
Far too late
Far too late!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge 3]
Hail kings
The new kings
Stronger than all
[Outro]
A simple process to legalize
There would not be a choice
But to take our side
Be there no question
Of certain strengths
Know this intention
Forever stronger than all
Stronger than all
