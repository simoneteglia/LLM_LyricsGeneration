[Verse 1]
Here we are in a world of corruption
Human nature is a violent breed
Who cares if there's no tomorrow
When I die for my future's laid out for me
Can't you see?
Rise
Above the lies
Morals on a backwards globe
A sin to you for me is hope
It's my life and provision
Black or white, some pay to pray
You question why they act this way
It's their fucking decision
[Chorus 1]
No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me
[Chorus 2]
Honesty born in me
Heresy
[Verse 2]
I know what's right or wrong
And my belief is stronger than your advice
People, they go to war
Because religion gives them reason to fight
Sacrifice
Die for pride
A group that caters, no one's fees
Or synthetic deities
is where I belong
My stand is the human race without a label or a face
So they can lick my sack
[Chorus 1]
No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me
[Chorus 2]
Honesty born in me
Heresy
Honesty born in me
Heresy
