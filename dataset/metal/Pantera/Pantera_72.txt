[Verse 1]
On one whole bottle "uplifting"
There is no telling what I'll do
Run head first into traffic
A mindset of annihilation
[Pre-Chorus]
No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
Ahh, no sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside
Your head now
[Chorus]
Uplift
Uplifting
Uplifting now
[Verse 2]
On hallucinogenic "uplift"
I can step out of my body
Religion is in myself
I'll split my head in two and see you twice
[Pre-Chorus]
No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
Ahh... no sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside
Your head now
[Chorus]
Uplift
Uplifting
Uplifting now
[Chorus]
Uplifting you now
[Bridge]
Give me alcohol extremities
Instead of proof-less Christianity
[Bridge]
Drunked up in a coma place
Critics disgusted but a smile on my fucking face
[Bridge]
I do anything that I want
I get everything that I ask
And if this message bothers you, you know
Just kiss my fucking asshole
[Outro]
Uplifting
Uplifting
Uplifting
Uplifting
