[Verse 1]
There's a double standard for the way we live
If there's nothing to have, well then there's nothing to give
I'll break a sweat and I don't regret
What you'd kill to see brings out the God in me
[Chorus]
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
[Verse 2]
The man of a thousand retirements
Will always be the one to tell you when to quit
I won't take stock in a withered man
I'm reaching into you, I'll make you understand
[Chorus]
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete
[Chorus]
Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge
