[Verse 1]
Half assed for most his life
Done nothing but stand
Talks big â€˜cause he's so small so
No one will give him a hand
The kind of guy that would steal your cash
And buy a burning house
Then call you up and invite you in
And jerk you off with a sandpaper hand
[Chorus]
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
Piss in the wind
[Verse 2]
A go-getter who ain't got none
A legend in his mind
Always the one to invite himself
And then gets left behind
Someone must've clipped his balls
Or wiped his ass all his life
A self-centered procrastinator
Attention seeker who's got nothing at all
[Chorus]
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
[Chorus]
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
[Outro]
Piss in the wind
Piss in the wind
Piss in the wind
Piss in the wind
