[Verse 1]
Numbing rumble
Countless medicine
Depleted from years of abuse
Death
[Pre-Chorus]
Death rattle shaking
And there's no faking, undertaking
[Verse 2]
Pressure point
Rigor mortis
Induce
Grasp of poison hands
[Pre-Chorus]
Death rattle shaking
From years of compulsive mistaking
[Chorus]
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
[Verse 2]
Disease of eyes
The addict blindfold
Reduced to
The realms of death
[Pre-Chorus]
Death rattle shaking
Accumulating life it’s taking
[Chorus]
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
Death
[Bridge]
I’ve seen the end
And there is no light
Like deadly snakes
Death rattle shakes
[Chorus]
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
Death
