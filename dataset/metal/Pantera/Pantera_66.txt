[Intro]
(Gone)
(Gone)
[Verse 1]
The time had finally come
To kill the vein
And I'm dropping down the dirt
On your grave
[Pre-Chorus]
It might hurt so bad
But I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you
[Verse 2]
The wrath has just begun
The time has finally come
[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts so bad
And it drives you mad
Life with a blinded view
[Chorus]
It makes them disappear
It fills their lives with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappear
[Hook]
(Gone)
(Gone)
[Verse 3]
So the coward has up and run
To be saved
But with each step taken down
You sink in that grave
[Pre-Chorus]
It might hurt so bad
But I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you
[Chorus]
It makes them disappear
It fills their lives with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappear
[Bridge]
Get the fuck on down the road
[Chorus]
It makes them disappear
It fills their lives with fear
When it feels you breathing near
It makes them disappear
