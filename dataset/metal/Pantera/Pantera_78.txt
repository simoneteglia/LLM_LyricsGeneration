[Verse 1]
Build an inner door, drop and then explore
You smoke your head on straight
Then drink your woes away
Some might not understand
Possession controls your head
[Chorus]
You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it
[Post-Chorus]
(Belong to it)
(Belong to it)
[Verse 2]
Your music is your friend?
But the roof above my head
So seriously I take
The will that never breaks
Some might not understand
Possession beyond your hands
[Chorus]
You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it
You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it
[Post-Chorus]
(Belong to it)
(Belong to it)
[Verse 3]
It's power and sin
(And then you've got all the other habits)
Whiskey and smoke
It's all a man could need
To plant the perfect seed
Disembody me
Yeah
[Chorus]
You recognize it
While some ignore it
Avoid the masses
You've got to belong to it
[Post-Chorus]
(Belong to it)
(Belong to it)
