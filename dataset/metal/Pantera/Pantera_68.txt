[Verse 1]
It's storming broken glass
Corpses left in piles
Ungracious bludgeonment
That breaks the earth for miles
Nothing can stop it, the day has come
From below it's catastrophic
[Chorus]
Freezing
There's no healing
Families are dying
This world is shattered
All shattered
[Verse 2]
Life crushing turbulence
This wrath can't be denied
Wishing you could help your friends
Standing where they died
Echoes haunting, a hollow planet
Lacerations, dissected nation
[Chorus]
Freezing
There's no healing
Everyone's dying
This world is shattered
All shattered
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Freezing
There's no healing
Everyone's dying
This world is shattered
All shattered
All shattered
All shattered
