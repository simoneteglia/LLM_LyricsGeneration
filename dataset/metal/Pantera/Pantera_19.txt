[Verse 1]
It's wearing on my mind
I'm speaking all my doubts aloud
You rob a dead man's grave
Then flaunt it like you did create
[Chorus 1]
If I hit bottom and everything's gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run
[Bridge 1]
It's digging time again
You're nurturing the weakest trend
[Chorus 2]
Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking
[Verse 2]
Fuck your magazine
And fuck the long-dead plastic scene
Pierce a new hole
If Hell was "in", you'd give your soul
[Chorus 3]
To the Great Southern Trendkill, that's right
The Great Southern Trendkill, fuck yeah
[Verse 3]
Buy it at a store
From MTV to on the floor
You look just like a star
It's proof you don't know who you are
[Chorus 1]
If I hit bottom and everything's gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run
[Bridge 2]
It's bullshit time again
You'll save the world within your trend
[Chorus 2]
Those with the heart and the brain to get past this
Can spot a pathetic without even asking
[Verse 4]
Politically relieved
Your product sold and well-received
The right words spun in gold
If I was God, you'd sell your soul
[Chorus 3]
To the Great Southern Trendkill, that's right
The Great Southern Trendkill, fuck yeah
Huah
[Breakdown]
Let's do this one southern-style
