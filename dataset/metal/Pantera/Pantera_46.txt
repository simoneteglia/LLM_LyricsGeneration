[Verse 1]
My skin is cold
Transfusion with somebody
Morose and old
Drop into fruitless dying
It was tempting and bared
The whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers
My silent time of losing
[Chorus]
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
[Verse 2]
Long for the blur
We cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt
Disgusted with my cheapness
[Chorus]
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
