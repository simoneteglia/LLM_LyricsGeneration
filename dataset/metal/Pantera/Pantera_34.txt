[Verse 1]
Enlight your sense of thought
Of touch, of real, a shield
An underground for this coward
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Building
A blood-in-water scent
It's like a raping
Without judgment
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Serve and protect you
His dick: his gun; his brain: his badge
[Chorus 1]
A faster way to kill them all would
Take too goddamn long
Absorb through pores, the great escape
[Post-Chorus 1]
Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal his displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past
Of what the fuck we live for:
Ourselves, ourselves
Ourselves, ourselves
[Verse 2]
Arm yourself, a branch
A third arm
Extend your health
Crawl inside euphoria
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Building
A blood-in-water scent
It's like a raping
It's entrapment
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Perverted handle
His getting by is a fisted fuck
[Chorus 2]
A faster way to exterminate them
Takes too fucking long
Absorb through pores, the great escape
[Post-Chorus 2]
Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal his displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past
Of what the fuck we live for:
Ourselves
[Verse 3]
Half-assed for most his life
Piss-poor little ham
Narc boy, a fake fuck limp dick
Sucking up to the man
And the world
We need another Cold War
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Building
A blood-in-water scent
It's like a raping
Without judgment
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Perverted handle
His dick: his gun; his brain: his badge
[Post-Chorus 3]
Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal your displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past
Of what the fuck we're living for:
[Outro]
Our-fucking-selves
