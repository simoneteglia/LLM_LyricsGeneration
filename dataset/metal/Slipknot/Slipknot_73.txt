[Verse 1]
My friends are all hurting from moments and regrets
And charity laced with a lie
And still, we keep hoping to fix all the defects
And strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together, for better or worse
Our history is too real to hate
Now and forever, we stay until morning
And promise to fight for our fate
[Chorus]
Till we die, till we die
[Verse 2]
The start of the journey is every bit worth it
I can't let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid
And the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped trying, I've never stopped feeling
Like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent
Compliments each and every one
[Chorus]
Till we die, till we die
We won't be forgotten
, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Till we die, till we die
[Verse 3]
My last true confession will open your eyes
I've never known trust like The Nine
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed
They'll never ever take us alive
[Chorus]
Till we die, till we die
We won't be forgotten
, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on, carry on
[Bridge]
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
[Chorus]
Till we die, till we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on, carry on
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
Till we die, till we die
[Outro]
Till we die, till we die
Till we die, till we die
