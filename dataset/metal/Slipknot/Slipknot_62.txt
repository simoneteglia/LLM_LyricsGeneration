[Intro: Corey Taylor &
Ross Robinson
]
Fuck!
Give me a scream, Corey
Yeah!
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
I don't like a fuckin; thing! Music sucks dick
Suck the snot end of the tip of my prick, you fucking cunts
Get off of my back
I don't wanna do a show with your shitty fuckin' band
You suck, they suck; guess what? Get fucked
I can't think of any other words to say but "fuck"
Don't drag our opinions, our opinions are great
It's new-school face motherfuckers I hate
[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Clown]
So, local bands: Suck these nuts
U.S. bands: Suck these nuts
Worldwide bands: Suck these nuts
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts, go!
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Don't berate me 'cause you can't stop me
From breakin' your face, it's you I'll erase
It's hate, motherfucker, hate, motherfucker, hate
[Chorus: Corey Taylor & Clown]
Local bands: Suck these nuts
U.S. bands: Suck these nuts
Worldwide bands: Suck these nuts
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts, go!
[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fuckin' great?
Get this or die, get this or die, get this or die, get this or die
