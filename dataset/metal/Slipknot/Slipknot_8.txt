[Verse 1]
Undo these chains, my friend
I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven
[Pre-Chorus]
You and I can't decide
Which of us was taken for granted
Make amends
Some of us are destined to be outlived
[Chorus]
Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore
[Verse 2]
Under the words of men
Something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend?
Insatiates never even bother
[Pre-Chorus]
You and I, wrong or right
Traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
You're not what you seem
[Chorus]
Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil
[Bridge]
I'm not your Devil anymore
Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, depravation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone
[Chorus]
So, step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore
[Outro]
So, step inside
Step inside
See the Devil in I
See the Devil in I
