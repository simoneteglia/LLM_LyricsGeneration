[Intro: Corey Taylor &
Chris Fehn
]
Fuck you all!
(All)
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is doing me in
[Chorus: Corey Taylor
with Chris Fehn
]
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit! Don't ever judge me!
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is doing me in
[Chorus: Corey Taylor
with Chris Fehn
]
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit! Don't ever judge me!
[Post-Chorus: Corey Taylor]
And don't you fucking judge me!
Burn!
[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
You got all my love, livin; in your own hate
Drippin' hole, man, hard step, no fate
Show you nothin', but I ain't holdin' back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this, 'cause you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
[Chorus: Corey Taylor
with Chris Fehn
]
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit! Don't ever judge me!
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit! Don't ever judge me!
[Post-Chorus: Corey Taylor]
Burn!
