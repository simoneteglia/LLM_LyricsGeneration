[Intro]
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here
(I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here
(I like it here)
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here
(I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here
(I like it here)
I like it here
[Verse 1]
The sentiment, the sad things
The punishments, the bad things
The cellular, the solenoid
The outer reach, the inner void
I keep repeating older answers
The questions are all brand-new
Does the room seem smaller these days?
Does the road seem long to you?
The accidents, the bitter pills
The populace, the stronger wills
The innocence, the common sense
The rare occasions exist
[Chorus]
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here
(I like it here)
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here
(I like it here)
[Instrumental Break]
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
[Chorus]
Oh, I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here
[Verse 2]
The harder work, the darker thoughts
The ultimatums, the tangled knots
The long depressions, the shorter fuse
Denominator is you
[Bridge]
Everybody has a cross to bear
I'll nail you up on mine
Couldn't tell you, don't know where to begin
Won't crumble, not this time
[Chorus]
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay
'Cause I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day
But I like it here
I know it's a shame, but I gotta stay (Stay)
'Cause I like it here
I know it's the same, it happens every day (Every day)
But I like it here
I like it here
