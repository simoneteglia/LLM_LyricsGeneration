[Verse 1]
She's sticking needles in her skin, I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy
But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see
Will she ever find one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely, but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world, no one hurts this pretty girl but her
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
Oh, I'm not insane
Please tell me she won't change
[Chorus]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me), oh
[Verse 2]
She's drowning in herself again, my God, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way
She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers, it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head, something tells me I'm the one who's kept
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, so volatile
A little better than a man defiled
Oh, I need the pain
Please tell me she won't change
[Chorus]
Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me), oh
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
We were meant to be together
Now die and fuckin' love me
We were meant to hurt each other
Now die and fuckin' love me
Die and fuckin' love me
Die and fuckin' love me
Die and fuckin' love me
