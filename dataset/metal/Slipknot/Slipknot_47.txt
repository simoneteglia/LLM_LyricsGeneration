[Verse 1]
Oh...
Meet the man that made me
Greet the can I came from
Oh, the fucking sacred heart of Jesus
Blew it in the back room
Feelin' like a real goon
Slam the fuck aside, man
I'm on, you're not
[Bridge]
I am the Great Big Mouth
!
I am the Great Big Mouth
!
Burn!
[Verse 2]
Good riddance, though I'm sad to say
I didn't get to kill you
Rhetoric, better look both ways
I gotta get an arm through
Stain!
What the fuck is up?
Get the fuck away
Run if you want to
Innocent? You're a guilty conscience
A temper breakthrough
Stain!
[Bridge]
Prepare, you fucker!
(Even though I won't ask him...)
Prepare, you fucker!
(Even though I won't ask him...)
Prepare, you fucker!
(Even though I won't ask him...)
Prepare, you fucker!
[Verse 3]
I don't give a shit, bitch
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I don't understand, bitch
You don't matter!
I don't give a fuck, man
I don't give a shit, man
I don't really care, man
I'm the supersized man!
For, for
You, your, I
I am the Great Big Mouth
!
[Outro]
You stupid fuck
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Stupid fuck!
Stupid fucking, stupid fuck
Stupid fuck! Fuck
Stop!
Fuck, stop, fuck! Fuck
(Take that, motherfuckers!)
