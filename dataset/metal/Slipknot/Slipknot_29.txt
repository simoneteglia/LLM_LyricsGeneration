[Verse 1]
Sitting in the dark, I can't forget
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again, I can't go back again
But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit
And when I got away, I only got so far
The other me is dead
I hear his voice inside my head
[Pre-Chorus]
We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
[Chorus]
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
[Verse 2]
You told me to love you and I did
Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit
So when I got away, I only kept my scars
The other me is gone
Now I don't know where I belong
[Pre-Chorus]
We were never alive
And we won't be born again
But I'll never survive
[Chorus]
With dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Dead visions in your name
Dead fingers in my veins
[Chorus]
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart, oh
[Outro]
Oh oh whoa
Oh oh whoa
Oh oh whoa
