[Intro]
Destroy
Ah!
[Verse 1]
Too tragic to stay with you
Too static to try for you
These scars, they swallow hard
The part of the past that's hollow and dark
Too horrid to kill for you
Too sordid to die with you
Unstable as always, come down
Everything else is just dust and sound
[Chorus]
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
See the shape (Broken and thrown away)
[Verse 2]
I'd give it all away
Come take it all away
You can't resent the fear
Somebody, tell me how I got here
I'd give it all to you
Come take it, it's all for you
The noise is so damn loud, but
Everything else is just dust and sound
[Chorus]
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
See the shape (Broken and thrown away)
[Bridge]
I don't wanna do this anymore
Everything's shit, everything's been taken, forsaken
Gotta start it over, 'cause I'm hearing it backwards
Don't make sense, don't feel better
Who's better? It's not that simple
You gotta figure it out before you make things difficult
It's not a word, it's a problem, the problem was easy
Draw your conclusions, solutions?
Anybody else wanna run?
Contorting, distorting, I am undone
One less propaganda nightmare fixture
Are you getting the picture?
[Chorus]
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
See the shape (Broken and thrown away)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
Separate (I've lost my only way)
See the shape (Broken and thrown away)
[Outro]
I'm broken and thrown away
Yeah
