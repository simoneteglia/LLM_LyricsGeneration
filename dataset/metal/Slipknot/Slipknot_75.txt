[Intro]
I don't seem to care today
I mirror what I love with what I hate
Empty ways can cloud your eyes
I only know because I tried
So come with me, come with me
Let's meet our contestants
That have no better time to play the game
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna give it away, underneath the citadels
Buried deep with your guilt and regrets
Leading in the dark, everything is wonderful
I don't care, I don't want to forget
Why is it a crime? It's none of your business
I prefer to be in hell by myself
Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody
Who refuses to forgive when nothing was taken
[Chorus]
No one else survives, I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes, alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all
[Verse 2]
Hidden in the rubble
Everybody's got a story to tell
What do I need? Eliminate the possible
All that's left is a man in a cell
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe a decision
Is the better way to go, the better way to be
I've got my demons, go get your own
Save another number, don't forget to hate me
[Chorus]
No one else survives, I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes, alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
No one else survives, I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes, lost in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all
[Outro]
The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us all, all, all, all
