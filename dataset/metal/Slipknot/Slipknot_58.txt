[Intro]
Pain, she loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
To feel more of my pain
[Verse]
I'm your friend and I'm your shade
Do what you want, just remember it's for love
I'm your wall and I'm your rock
Don't run away, don't forget it's only love
I'm your chain and I'm your lock
There's no escape, just as long as I say, "Love"
I'm your death and I'm your cold
You end with me, remember, this was never love
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take this
(Love, love, love, love)
And I'll take that
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take you too
(Love, love, love, love)
You can never give too much
[Bridge]
Pain, she loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free, pain
Pain, she loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
To feel our love, pain
[Outro]
I've always
Felt this way
For you
