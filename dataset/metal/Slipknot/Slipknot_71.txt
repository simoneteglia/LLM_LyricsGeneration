[Verse 1]
Gone, I couldn't murder your promise
Right before my eyes
The revolutions of my psychosis
Kept me outta the way
[Refrain]
Once inside, all I hold is ash...
[Verse 2]
Fall, suppressing every feeling
I'm in so much pain
I have every fuckin' right to hate you
I can't take it!
[Pre-Chorus]
The hardest part was knowing
That I could never be you
Now all I do is sit around
And wish I could forget you
[Chorus]
My demise,
I took a life worth living
And made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
(Stop!)
I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop!) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop!) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop!) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
[Verse 3]
Who are you to me? Who am I to you?
Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence?
By default, you are my only link to the outside
Psychosomatic suicide
Where were you when I was down?
Can you show me a way...
To face every day with this face?
Goodbye
[Chorus]
My demise, I took a life worth living
And made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
[Bridge]
Oh, when I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe
I see you fucking me
And I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate
The one and only answer, so much for memories...
I wanna dress in your insecurities
And be the perfect you, I'm through
I'm outstretched out for all to loathe
Here we go, the ultimate irony
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
My demise, I took a life worth living
And made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
(Stop) I'm always ready to die
But you're killing me
[Outro]
(Stop) Killing me
(Stop) Killing me
(Stop) Killing (Stop) me
Killing me
