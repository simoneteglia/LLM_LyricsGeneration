[Verse 1]
Do you believe?
Do you fade like a dream?
Let me hear you breathe, let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes
Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments
[Verse 2]
The blood and the body control the cut, so it's seamless
Show me your heart, show me the way to complete this
Tethered to a scene, I treasure, can you help me?
I sever, God, it's perfect, it's never really perfect
Now, I can finally be myself 'cause I don't wanna be myself
[Chorus]
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I cannot maintain a semblance of normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain than try to fit in with you anymore
I'll throw it all away like everybody else
I can finally be myself 'cause I donâ€™t wanna be myself
[Chorus]
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
[Chorus]
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
