[Verse 1]
Well, you can go it alone or keep it in between
The pages of the books you burn so no one gets to read
The fingers pull your stitches tight
But knowing someone's secret is not enough
Everyone's a little bit a lot of the time
[Chorus]
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
[Verse 2]
When now is not the time, tomorrow disagrees
But your real world isn't ready to face the face behind the real me
Time to think it over, I'm over trying to overthink
I've had enough
Everybody's limited to what's on their mind
[Chorus]
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
[Bridge]
Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders
Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders
Make yourself a martyr's pet and watch them all escape
(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders
Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
Make yourself at home instead, you'll lose your toxic ways
(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
[Verse 3]
Go in alone, suffer for your feelings, I'm not enough (Not enough)
But everyone's a little bitter all of the time
[Chorus]
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
