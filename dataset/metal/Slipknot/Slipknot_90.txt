[Verse 1]
I don't know why I never told you
I don't know why I never tried
When we shed these bitter skins again (Skins again)
All the reasons come to life
[Chorus]
But now it's over...
Now it's over...
Now it's over...
Now it's over...
[Verse 2]
I don't know why you never asked me
And I don't know why you never cared
When we hide these little sins again (Sins again)
All the reasons have to die
[Chorus]
But now it's over...
Now it's over...
Now it's over...
Now it's over...
Now it's over...
And now it's over...
Now it's over...
And now it's over...
[Outro]
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
