[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Liberate
my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I just want to liberate my madness!
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness!
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Section off myself
Put a wall up, what the hell have I done?
Keep the dog at bay
Survive by saving me
Values and the game
Not a fuckup, not a part of your lie
I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond!
[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Chris Fehn
]
Stand off of the shit
Back off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
(
Your garbage in is garbage out
)
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
(Your garbage in is garbage out)
Liberate my madness...
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I just want to liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
I am not ashamed
What is vital isn't always humane
You can break in vain
But you can't break away
Even in my face
Lotta bullshit, not a lotta the truth
I can't see from here
But I can smell your fear
[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Chris Fehn
]
Back off of the shit
Stand off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
(Your garbage in is garbage out)
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
(Your garbage in is garbage out)
[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
Saved, you're such a slave, I don't expect a name
You don't care, I wasn't witness
I can't be a part of a system such as this
Hard eyes glow right in my darkness again with the sickness
Renegade sisters, blisters, salivate, litigate, liberate
Madness, sadness, fuck this, how long have I had this?
I don't need this, outta my business
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God
Fraud!
Fraud!
Fraud!
[Outro: Corey Taylor]
Liberate my madness
Liberate my madness
I just want to liberate my madness
Liberate my madness
