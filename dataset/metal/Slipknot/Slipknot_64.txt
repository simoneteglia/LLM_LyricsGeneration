[Verse 1]
Give me the dust of my father
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself
[Pre-Chorus]
Follow me,
I've come so far, I'm behind again
Follow me, I wish so hard, I'm there again
Follow me, follow me
[Chorus]
All that I wanted were things I had before
All that I needed, I never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
All of my endings are waiting to begin
[Verse 2]
I know the way, but I falter
I can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place Raziel keeps safe
[Pre-Chorus]
Follow me, I've seen so much, I'm blind again
Follow me, I feel so bad, I'm alive again
Follow me
[Chorus]
All that I wanted were things I had before (Oh, oh)
All that I needed, I never needed more (Oh, oh)
All of my questions are answers to my sins (Oh, oh)
All of my endings are waiting to begin
