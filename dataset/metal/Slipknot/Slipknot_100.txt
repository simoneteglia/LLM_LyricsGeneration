[Intro]
Fuck you!
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Many have come and gone
Still left out of the guttural swansong
I'm takin' nothin' but the best in the area
Get me grief, but, fucker, I'll stare you down
Two, three, you're out of there
Maybe it's me, but I'm frantic in a panic
Ain't never had a problem since you stopped coming here
Big man walkin', but, bitch, I'm still talkin'
Can't you see it's gotta be this way?
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(boy)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Ain't gonna leave and you know I'm never gone fade
Here it comes again, gotta burn again
Time now, throw down, don't dirty me
Right on your ugly-ass face because
I ain't not the one who let you in
And I ain't not the one who set you off
But I know damn well when someone's pushin' my buttons
Lemme tell you somethin': I'll push you back!
"As soon as that camera is off, he gonna fuck that little dog."
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(boy)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(bitch)
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(bitch)
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
(bitch)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
[Outro: Corey Taylor &
Clown

You're made of flesh
(Now what I'm focused on)
You're made of flesh
(Now what I'm focused on)
You're made of flesh
(Now what I'm focused on)
You're made of flesh
(Now what I'm focused on)
You're made of flesh
(Now what I'm focused on)
You're made of flesh
(Now what I'm focused on)
You're made of flesh
(Now what I'm focused on)
You're made of flesh
