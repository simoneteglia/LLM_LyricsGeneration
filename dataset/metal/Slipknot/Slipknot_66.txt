[Intro]
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
We've, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
We, too, feel alone
[Chorus]
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
[Verse]
Where have I been all this time?
Lost in sliding fatal decline
I've been waiting for this to unfold, but
The pieces are only as good as the whole
Severed myself from my old life
Cut off the only thing that was bright
What If I never saw you again?
I'd die right next to you in the end
[Chorus]
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
[Outro]
I won't let you walk away
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
