[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I feel it now, a new restraint
The fool is only he who fools again (Again), again (Again), again (Again)
I needed all the pain you saved
To wash across my face like time began (Began), began (Began), began (Began)
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody lies when they say "forever"
No one else will understand
Pull the stitches tight until we sever
Break me in your open hands
[Chorus]
Please, forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be god
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just take my heart and twist me into knots
[Verse 2]
I know I never had a chance (Chance), chance (Chance)
Oh, I know I'm wretched and I stand (Stand), stand (Stand)
Seeking all the things you have
If I die with you, it's worth the life, life, life, life (life)
[Pre-Chorus]
I was just a nothing wanting something
Only you will only do
Everything and more, it comes to nothing
If it doesn't come with you
[Chorus]
Please, forget me not
I need your simple pleasures to be god
And please, my sweet De Sade
Just eat my heart and twist me into knots
[Bridge]
Something dominating nothing
Nothing animate is something used
Fill me, wait a minute, kill me
Feel me, I am the mood: abuse
Carve, carve, carve
I am starve, starve, starved
For the warmth of your will
And the edge of your purest thrill
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
De Sade, De Sade, De Sade, De Sade
De Sade, De Sade, De Sade, De Sade
