[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Rise
We're gonna need another witness just like you
Surprise
Your inadmissible testimony might be true
You better pull the hood (Get it off, get it off)
You'll be lucky to tear the place down
Then you're gone for good (Set it off, set it off)
Scorched earth is your favorite sacred ground
Turn away if you know you wanna stay
But you're never gonna like what's left of me
When the carcass is down and the predator's around
You're gonna play dead if you wanna run free
[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a tortured soul
But I don't wanna hear about it
You say you're not involved
But all you do is talk about it
Go bless this shit where you belong
[Chorus]
For your own information
For your own entertainment
This hell comes to you live
And if you need some assistance
A little time to convince it
Dial in your sordid hive mind
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Crawl across the broken glass of every window you're pressed against
And scrawl, your little bits of hate
Your little digital graffiti breaks
So don't close your eyes (Get it off, get it off)
When you're pulling your messages down
You wanna go to sleep? (Set it off, set it off)
You'll be lucky if they take you without making a sound
What a guy, God, I hope you fucking die
And your sympathies don't mean shit to me
When the competence goes and the predator knows
You better be dead if you wanna be free
[Pre-Chorus]
You're such a tortured soul
But I don't wanna hear about it
You say you're not involved
But all you do is talk about it
One more thing
And don't forget to burn
[Chorus]
For your own information
For your own entertainment
This hell comes to you live
And if you need some assistance
A little time to convince it
Dial in this sordid
Protect the hive mind
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Hold on, there's a river around you
Swim hard for the other side
Don't drown to spite your critics
Just blow a kiss goodbye
Hold on, there's a river around you
Swim hard for the other side
Don't drown to spite your critics
Just blow a kiss goodbye
[Outro]
Yeah
Protect the hive
Yeah
Protect theâ€”
