[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm ethereal
My children are legion, serial
They stick to my skin like beloved cysts
I tear away with my nails and teeth and fists
Touch the hands of inverted saints
Follow my heart through the threaded pain
Callow man is a sentinel screaming
I see the future, the future is bleeding
[Verse 2]
Sores
Every goddamn minute, I can feel 'em now
Like a virus, you will never kill me now
Goin' underground, comin' on like hepatitis
We're out, and you can't reshape us
Another bug in the construct
Tearing up the main bus B
Zeros and ones are everything, execute me
[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me, yeah
[Verse 3]
What do you need to see? Ya feel the impact?
Gotta retract, everybody get back
What is this? It's like a big conspiracy
Fields of dejected, morbid progeny
They always say that it's always our fault
But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt
Man, it's always the same if we talk or complain
We only wanna upset the balance
How's it feel to be the new abortion?
The only generation to suffer extortion
[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
[Bridge]
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
[Chorus]
Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me
Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
Oh, you can't take my soul away from me
[Outro]
You can't take my soul away from me
Fuck you
