[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
God's in a coma
Put faith in a life support
Running away won’t feel the same
If you reach your metaphysical last resort
Oh, malevolence and purgatory give you pause
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving
[Refrain]
(Good for you) What a cliché
(Just not true) What a giveaway
(What comes now) Can’t be the last one
Falling down
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?
[Chorus]
What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven
[Verse 2]
Once again, we got suffocated
In a sick perversion of a spider’s web
Crawling over all the spent digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Gotta pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you could picture a future
That doesn’t resemble your crazy inventions
[Refrain]
(Good on you) I don't mean it
(Dream come true) I don’t need it
(What goes up) Another hollow one
Must come down
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?
[Chorus]
What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it’s too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven
[Bridge]
A mirror only works if you open your eyes
But even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
I know you'll never guess, but darling, you're so critical
Darling, you're so critical
Oh, you're so critical
[Verse 3]
Oh, this is a cave-in
The weight of the catalyst
Just wait, let the games begin
Gonna tell you all about it for the savages
[Refrain]
(Good for you) Not another one
(Just not true) Not another one
(What comes now?) This world is
Falling down
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?
[Chorus]
What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven
[Outro]
It's begun
Oh, you're so critical
Yeah
Oh, you're so critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
