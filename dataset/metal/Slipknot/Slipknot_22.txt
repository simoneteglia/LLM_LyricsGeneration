[Intro]
Fuck!
[Verse 1]
Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm gonna burn, so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind 'cause you're never going to give in
It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack
[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me, yeah
[Verse 2]
Svengali, why are we the enemies?
I never follow, and I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna get you
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first
move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?
[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
I hope you live to see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die, you see my face
You're the only one to blame, yeah
Fuck
[Bridge]
The prescient, the nascent, the quotient
(They all will fall)
The cystic, symbolic, condition
(Systemic)
Egregious, replete with these lesions
(Contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish creation
(Your failure) Yeah
[Verse 3]
No accountability, divisibility
I point a finger, but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away, the killer is disavowed
[Chorus]
The lord of lies, the morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides, your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
I hope you live to see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die, you see my face
You're the only one to blame
[Outro]
The lord of lies (The lord of lies)
The morning star (The morning star)
You had to be set free (You had to be set free)
Opposing sides (Opposing sides)
Your choices are (Your choices are)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
Yeah
