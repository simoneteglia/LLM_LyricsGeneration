[Intro]
"Yeah!"
"Ha-ha.,."
"Ah..."
"Aha-ha..."
"Aha..."
[Verse 1]
Relax... it's over; you belong to me
I fill your mouth with dirt
Relax... it's over; you can never leave
I take your second digit with me...
Love...
"Ah..."
[Verse 2]
You are... my first; I can barely breathe
I find you fascinating
You are... my favorite; lay you down to sleep
It's all that I can do to stop...
Love...
"Ah..."
[Verse 3]
So blue... so broken, paper doll decays
I haven't left you yet
So cold... subversive; your eyes are full of bleach
Tomorrow, I will go away again...
Love...
"Love..."
"Ah.."
"Oh, God..."
"Oh, God!"
"It tears us; it makes us"
"It makes all one!"
"It tears us apart...!"
"It tears us apart!"
"It cuts us, it cuts us all..,"
"I can't breathe..."
[Bridge]
You are mine
You will always be mine
I can tear you apart
I can recombine you
All I want is to covet you all
You belong to me
I will kill you to love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you
"You fucking bitch..."
"Fuck you"
"Fucking bitch!"
"Do you see?"
"Do you see?"
"Do you see?!"
"It's you and I, love"
"Ah"
"You..."
"It's you and I, love"
"Ah"
"You..."
(em ta kool t'noD)
"You..."
"You and I..."
"I can smell you"
"I can smell you"
"I can smell you"
"Ahh..."
"I can smell you all over me!"
"Ha-ha..."
[Outro]
I fucking told you
I fucking told you
I fucking told you
I fucking told you
Fucking told you, fucking told you
Fucking told you, fucking told you
You'll live forever
You'll live forever
"Ha-ha..."
You will live forever
