[Intro]
One, two, three, nil
[Verse 1]
Chaos, it's just the beginning
Every promise I made, I'm rescinding
Center mass in the middle of the monster
I'm getting tired of drowning the constant
Cry for help, it's debatable
The only reason that you love me is I'm hated by all
Come on, come see dysfunction
I guess we're gonna leave it open for discussion
Who am I? Where am I going?
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction
[Pre-Chorus]
This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
(This is not my) Revolution
(This is not my) Convolution
(This is not my) Expectation
(This is not my) Desperation
[Verse 2]
Yeah! Holed up, scarred, and tamed for the
hell
of it
Look at me, I am the glorified malcontent
Save me? Save this!
All I gotta do is give up, and all is forgiven
I'm sick of being the butt of a cosmic joke
And I don't get the punchline
A million people lined up for miles
To see the
Great Big Mouth
shut up and apologize!
[Pre-Chorus]
This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
(This is not my) Revolution
(This is not my) Convolution
(This is not my) Only reason to question why
Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye!
[Chorus]
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye!
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye!
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye!
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye!
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
[Bridge]
I'm the pariah (Break me)
I am the liar (Save me)
I can take anything (Make me)
Accuse me of everything (Kill me)
Cut off the system (Enslave me)
Deny my existence (Waste me)
I won't be afraid (Try me)
I won't be unmade (Deny me)
So come on, break it off
Come on, buy the lie
Come on, say it, say it
Come on, say goodbye!
[Chorus]
Goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye!
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye!
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye! Goodbye!
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye!
[Outro]
One, two, three, nil
Yes
