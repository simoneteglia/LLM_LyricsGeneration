[Intro: Corey Taylor]
I'm cold, I'm ugly
I'm always confused by everything
I can stare into a thousand eyes
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes
My heroes are dead, they died in my head
Thin out the herd,
squeeze out the pain
Something inside me has opened up again
[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor]
Thoughts of me exemplified, all the little flaws I have denied
Forget today, forget whatever happened
Every day, I see a little more of overall deficiencies
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Chris Fehn
]
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
I save all the bullets from ignorant minds
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens
I decrease, while my symptoms increase
[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor]
God, what the fuck is wrong? You act like you knew it all along
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing
All I ever wanted out of you was something you could never be
Now take a real good look at what you've fucking done to me
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Chris Fehn
]
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
[Interlude]
"I haven’t got time for the living.”
"I haven't got time for the living."
[Bridge: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
boy
Give me any reason why I'd need you
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
boy
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
bitch
Give me any reason why I'd need you
Give me any reason why I'd need you,
bitch
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
[Verse 3: Corey Taylor]
I keep my scars from prying eyes
, incapable of ever knowing why
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer
Why am I so fascinated by bigger pictures, better things?
But I don't care what you think, you'll never understand me
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Chris Fehn
]
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell
(The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
[Outro: Corey Taylor]
Fuck!
Dilute
Dilute
