[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
I know my uses, I have my pride
But my heart is still untamed
I learn my lessons, I've conquered death
I go on, and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes
They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't
be
told
I know my voices, they tell me to believe
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Another fuckin' accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange
In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's every day
[Chorus: Corey Taylor,
Chris Fehn, Paul Gray & Clown
]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
[Verse 3: Corey Taylor]
I beg your pardon, I'm out of the way
A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over I smell the decay
Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same
In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine
The agony of cynicism beckons me
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's everything
[Chorus: Corey Taylor,
Chris Fehn, Paul Gray & Clown
]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
[Chorus: Corey Taylor,
Chris Fehn, Paul Gray & Clown
]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey
, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
