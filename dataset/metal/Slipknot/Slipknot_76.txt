[Intro: Corey Taylor
with Clown
]
Pain,
made to order
Pain,
made to order
Pain,
made to order
Pain
[Verse: Corey Taylor]
I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave
Better get an army, cuz the fire left me unscathed
You betcha bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around, cuz I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the
achtung
, get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself, are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me, totalitarian
The one and only motherfucka, top of the world, man
'Cause I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash-land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels - what you gonna do?
[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
All I hear is human noise
You made your own fucking choice
I belong to only me
Silence for my revelry
[Breakdown: Corey Taylor]
I can only die over time
Filthy hands, stay away from mine
Every reason is a right to hate
Painful clutch - death is fine, give me mine
[Chorus: Clown &
Corey Taylor
]
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
[Breakdown: Corey Taylor]
Somebody explain this
You don't care, 'cause you don't exist
What the fuck, is this another joke?
Reckoning
[Chorus: Corey Taylor,
Clown
&
Chris Fehn
]
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
