[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not
I won't be, dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not

Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not
I won't be, dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh
[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Lost in the pessimistic state of perception
It's been hard to participate in natural instances
and
Due to my history, I don't know what's next for me
,
but
Keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep aware in they head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
[Pre-Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
I'm sorry, mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt, I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt, I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not
I won't be, dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall, my nigga, I slip not
I won't be, dead, misled ahead, I never break, uh
[Verse 2: Kin$oul]
Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip
My mind drift to a place where the devil lives
My soul rise to a sky made of abyss
With the evidence that I made with the elements
Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now, we tearing it down
We make these incredible sounds we cherishin' now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out
[Outro: Killstation]
Oh, you can't run away
From everything you made
You try to erase
The memories will fade
