[Intro]
Come on!
[Verse 1]
Watch those idiosyncrasies
Watch all the idiots fall on me
Running out of ways to get outta the way
Take another shot just to stay the same
But I need some balance, back it off
Fill your lungs till it makes you cough
Tell me everything's gonna be all right
'Cause I don't think I'll make it through tonight
[Refrain]
The only way
Is all the way!
The only way
Is all the way!
The only way (The only way)
Is all the way! (Is all the way)
The only way (The only way)
Is all the way!
[Verse 2]
Oh, my God!
It's Judgment Day, and I'm not prepared
Everybody out there's runnin' scared
So take a little bit off the top
I don't care, just make it stop
[Chorus]
I won't give another soul... to you (I will never)
I won't give another life... to you
[Post-Chorus]
No, you have to stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
[Bridge]
Do one thing and say something cryptic
But the styles always clash
One thing I know for sure:
The hypothetical won't work anymore
One wrong move, and they will pound!
My nails are tight inside my wrists
This sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental
Deity experimental, faith is accidental
[Chorus]
I won't give another soul... to you (I will never)
I won't give another life... to you (I will never)
I won't give another thought... to you (I will never)
I won't give any more of my hope... to you
[Outro]
Quit it! What do you want?
Quit it! What do you want?
