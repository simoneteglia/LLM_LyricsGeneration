[Verse 1]
Even if you run... I will find you
I decided I want you, now I know... I need
If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought
Keep in mind: I'm with you
Never left out fate, can't concentrate
Even if you run...
[Refrain]
You will be mine!
Ah, fucking you will be mine!
Ah, fucking you will be mine!
Ah, fucking you will be mine!
[Pre-Chorus]
I found you
Leanin' out of an open window
You laughed, your fingers clenched
Too perfect, far too careless
I couldn't help myself, I just took you
[Chorus]
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
[Post-Chorus]
(You have brought it out of me)
Mistake
(You have brought it out of me)
Mistake
(You have brought it out of me)
Mistake
(You have brought it out of me)
Mistake
[Verse 2]
Better make yourself at home, you're here to stay
You won't bother me... if you let me bother you
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut
Keep in mind, I watch you
Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker
Even if you run
[Bridge]
What the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
And what the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
And what the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' it
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' it
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' it
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' it
[Chorus]
Man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake
[Post-Chorus]
(You have brought it out of me)
Mistake
(You have brought it out of me)
Mistake
(You have brought it out of me)
Mistake
(You have brought it out of me)
[Outro]
Aah!
Aah!
