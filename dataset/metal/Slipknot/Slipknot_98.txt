[Intro]
Isn't this what you came here for?
Isn't this what you came here for?
Oh, isn't this what you came here for?
Isn't this what you came here for?
[Verse 1]
Blah, blah, blah, I don't wanna hear shit
Medicals and miracles and all of the
obits
We stay all day and leave all night
Tell me like it is because we know it ain't right, they're
[Pre-Chorus]
Paid off
Catch a tiger by the total price of all the penalties
Let's go
And don't you wanna see another model just like you?
[Chorus]
Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (Now don't think twicе)
You always buy brand-new
Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in thе old abandoned)
My advice (Now don't think twice)
You always buy brand-new, yeah
[Verse 2]
Oh, gang star, shoot it in the panzar
Could it be the answer to the overwhelming ordinary?
Pick a vision and just follow the clues
We don't need the conversation, we just confuse the
[Pre-Chorus]
Breakdown
Oh, don't adjust your set
Now, careful, there's no feedback guarantees
Why now?
It always seems to be another job you can't get through
[Chorus]
Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (Now don't think twice)
You always buy brand-new
Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (Now don't think twice)
You always buy brand-new
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
(O-oo-oh)
Your warranty is not a guarantee to me
(O-oo-oh)
Your innocence is just a pittance and naïve
(O-oo-oh)
Contrive the controversy, sinister and plain
(O-oo-oh)
Upgrade the system 'til the virus can be sane
[Refrain]
Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?
Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?
Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?
Got it all back but I blew it on the trade-in
Isn't this what you came here for?
[Chorus]
Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (Now don't think twice)
You always buy brand-new
Too smart but you can't imagine (Too much time in the old abandoned)
My advice (Now don't think twice)
You always buy brand-new
[Outro]
Haha (Haha, haha, haha)
