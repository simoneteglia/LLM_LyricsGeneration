[Intro]
Thou shalt not
[Verse 1]
Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence, dominion
I only wanna believe in fucking anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything
[Pre-Chorus 1]
The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
[Verse 2]
Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fucking everything
But we're alive, and we're not accepting anything
[Pre-Chorus 2]
The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Annihilation
[Chorus]
I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more
[Bridge]
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
[Verse 3]
I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate
Live forever, well I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours,
but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fucking anything
But my solace is I can handle everything
[Pre-Chorus 3]
The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Obliteration
[Chorus]
I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
[Chorus]
I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more
[Outro]
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
