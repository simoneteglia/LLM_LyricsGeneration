[Intro]
Read all about it if you want to know
Read all about what they want you to know
[Verse 1]
Everything is god online, and it's as evil as it gets
This is not a fuckin' trick, either follow or repent (No choice)
Get infected by a vertical event
Check the meter, check your watch
Are they ever gonna stop?
Runnin' out of daylight, nighttime's better
But we know how to handle the truth, motherfucker
Scandalous know-it-all, feedback chamber
Nobody wants the proof, they want a number
[Pre-Chorus]
We don't deny what is wrong with our lives
We can't decide what is left of our right to silence our remains
Buried in the back and I'm sick and alive
Hollow as a breath, the further you dive
[Chorus]
Oh, how I've missed your honesty
You never miss with your intensity
You're gonna need a new disguise
Vessels burst, veins release
Just slide into the nearest lie
[Verse 2]
(One, two, oh my god)
All the ligatures are getting tight, like a style
Murder another mouth before the trial
Scalpel and then you scalp 'em to fucking death
Kills for the other vampires and surrogates
It's a ploy for attention and evidence
All your fucking monsters are flaws in your common sense
Do the dance while the shovels are breaking dirt
Everybody mind your fuckin' business or you get hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
We don't deny what is wrong with our lives
We can't decide what is left of our right to silence our remains
Buried in the back and I'm sick and alive
Hollow as a breath, the further you dive
[Chorus]
Oh, how I've missed your
namaste
You never miss with your integrity
You're gonna need a new disguise
Vessels burst, veins release
Just slide into the nearest lie
[Bridge]
Read all about it if you want to know
(Everything is god online)
Read all about it if you want to know
(Everything is god online)
Read all about it if you want to know
[Breakdown]
Stoned like a beast on a chain lookin' dead
Feelin' strange, what the fuck
I'm material to sew into the stains
Like a catalogue of pain, like a martyr in restraints
I can kill with a will, and it's stronger every day
I'm a knife, I'm a gun, I'm a slit, I'm a scar
I'm a scream, I'm a death, I'm a threat, I'm afraid
That you will never understand I'm not the same
You better call the triple 9
, I want a face
That you can only recognize
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
[Outro]
When everything is god online, nothing is
When everything is god online, nothing is
