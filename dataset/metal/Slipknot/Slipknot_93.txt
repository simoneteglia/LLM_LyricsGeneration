[Intro]
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, and I know it's you
[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody gonna cut me, corrupt me, instruct me, consequently
Condition your interruption to disrupt me
What's the matter with my image: the balance or the presence?
Older and still blown out, follow me, I know where we're going now
Pentagrams, penitentiaries, I've been here for centuries
I'm a product of the system, the price you can't resist
Fuck, I bless where I spit, cross the ground, get over it
Massacre disaster is the perfect one we need today
[Pre-Chorus]
I know the reaper is a liar
And I still don't care because I know it's you
[Chorus]
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, I know it's
[Verse 2]
Slaughter,
slaughter, it can happen to a father,
father, you see?
Everybody has a weakness, reveal yourself, Iâ€™ll eat the pieces
Don't be judging me, I know the dues, I know the fees
I know the rules, I know you cheat, we never need to brandish heat
Psychos, cycles madness comes around, around, around, around
Tyrants, tirades love to swing the hammer, bring the hammer down
Famous and infamous, no way I'm knowing I'm obsessed with this shit
I just want to get what's coming to me
[Pre-Chorus]
I know the reaper is a liar
And I still don't care because I know it's you
[Chorus]
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, because I know it's you
[Verse 3]
I was a sign, the sign was in the eyes, the eyes were in the skull
The skull was in the wall, the wall was in my head
My head was in the ground, the ground was all decayed
The rotting had a name, the name was a sign
Fuck you
Yeah
Yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I know the mystery is the fire
I wish it wasn't true
I know the fuckin' reaper is a liar
And I still don't care because I know it's you
[Chorus]
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it because I know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, I fucking know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it, I fucking know it's you
One of us knows who hates me
One of us loves it because I know it's you
