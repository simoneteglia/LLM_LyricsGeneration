[Intro: Corey Taylor]
My freedom is best
Whole country's on house arrest
And everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died
Facedown on a "suicide"
The motherfucker's on self-destruct
Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front
Save this! My rage is bliss!
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed!
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Where's Chuck D when ya need him?
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bedspread
The maniac psycho
Cool J screamed the shit, but I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so
Just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell
Better back the fuck on up
'Cause this is...
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
No kind of life!
This is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life!
This is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me)
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
Savor every flavor you got, 'cause it's not your own
Badass at bat, man
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Breathe! Amer-cult, breathe! One more, seethe!
Freak like you gotta pair, won't be my fault
When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life
This is...
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
No kind of life!
This is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life!
This is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me)
[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
I can't remember, I don't understand
Is it malice that makes you this way?
Carry it with you till someone forgives you
I laugh, 'cause there's nothing to say
You can't begin to consider the palpable hate
In the air when you're here
None of us wonder what weather you're under
You're making it perfectly clear
[Verse 3: Corey Taylor]
Lights ain't on, shit ain't right
Never had peace but I gotta fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
You're all reality and sound bites
And the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question
The price is too human for fucking sake
This is...
[Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
No kind of life!
This is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life!
This is no kind of life!
You can't blame me
[Outro: Corey Taylor]
I can't be
I can't be
I can't be blamed
