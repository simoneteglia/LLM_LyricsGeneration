[Verse 1]
The whole world is my enemy, and I'm a walking target
Two times the devil with all the significance
Dragged and raped for the love of a mob
I can't stay because I can't be stopped
Eat motherfuckers alive who cross us
I know you're all tired of the same ol' bosses
Let me tell you how it's gonna be:
I'm gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me
[Verse 2]
Welcome to the same ol' fucking scam
Same ol' shit in a dead fad
Everybody wants to be so hard
Are you real or a second-rate sports card?
They all lost their dad or their wife just died
They never got to go outside, shut up
Nobody gives a fuck
It doesn't change the fact that you suck
[Chorus]
(We are) The anticancer
(We are) The only answer
Stripped down, we want you dead
But what's inside of me, you'll never know
(We are) Bipolar gods
(We are) You know what we are
My life was always shit
And I don't think I need this anymore
[Verse 3]
Now I'm not pretty, and I'm not cool
But I'm fat, and I'm ugly and proud, so fuck you
Standing out is the new pretension
Streamline the (
sic)ness
, half-assed aggression
You gotta see it to believe it, we all got conned
All the mediocre sacred cows we spawned
Put your trust in the mission
We will not repent, this is our religion
[Chorus]
(We are) The anticancer
(We are) The only answer
Stripped down, we want you dead
But what's inside of me, you'll never know
(We are) Bipolar gods
(We are) You know what we are
My life was always shit
And I don't think I need this anymore
[Bridge]
I am hated
You are hated
We are hated
I am hated
[Verse 4]
Everything sucks, and I can prove it
Everybody dies, shuffle on, remove it
Individuals, indispensable
I'm the paradox deity vessel
...The other side holds no secret
But this side is done, I don't need it
Before you go, you should know you're breaking down
You'll be rotten by the time you're underground
[Post-Verse]
Fuck you
[Chorus]
(We are) The anticancer
(We are) The only answer
Stripped down, we want you dead
But what's inside of me, you'll never know
(We are) Bipolar gods
(We are) You know what we are
My life was always shit
And I don't think I need this anymore
[Outro]
(We are) The source of conscience
(We are) Distorted sentients
There's only one thing left
And I can't leave until it's sated
(We are) The absolute
(We are) Controlling you
They're closing in, I can't escape
I am hated!
