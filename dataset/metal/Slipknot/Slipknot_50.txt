[Intro: Corey Taylor & Clown]
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Inside, inside, inside, inside
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
Giving in to what has got me
Bleeding claustrophobic, scarred
Severed me from all emotion
Life is just too fucking hard
Snap! Your face was all it took
'Cause this need ain't doin' me no good
Fall on my face, but can't you see?
This fucking life is killing me!
[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Tearing me
inside
Tearing me
inside
Tearing me
inside
Tearing me
inside
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
Too far gone, I'm catatonic
Leaving you to criticize
Empty shell and running naked
All alone... lobotomized
Back and forth between my hang-ups
It isn't easy to be hated
Where do ya go? What do ya do?
Simpleton, impromptu
Crazy eight, I never cared
Not once, gotta get away!
[Pre-Chorus: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Tearing me
inside
Tearing me
inside
Tearing me
inside
Tearing me
inside
[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone
[Bridge: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
You're gone, you're gone
Somos feos y apestamos pero reinamos joto
, motherfucker
You're gone, you're gone
[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone
[Outro: Corey Taylor]
Gone, gone, gone
Pray
