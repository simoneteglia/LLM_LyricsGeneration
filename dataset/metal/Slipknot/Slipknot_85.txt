[Interlude]
Go on, what about the boy?
She lay as though she were in a trance
With her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming
She said to him, "I lie beyond the sea"
And then all of a sudden, her head dipped back, and she vanished
Gone, gone without a trace
She's never coming back
Do you know what it's like to live with that?
No one knows what it's like
The only one who knew me, gone
I know what you want, and I can give it to you
I am hungry and tired
Have you ever seen God?
