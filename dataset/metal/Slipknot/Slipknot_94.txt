[Intro]
Yeah!
[Verse 1]
I am a product of your conduct
The uncontrollable urges that made me
Have made us all
; are you proud? Do you even care?
You taught us all to lie; that's how we made it here
You should've buried the truth with your secrets
But you were far too impressed with your pretense
Now, as far as I know, I don't know anything
'Cause you made damn sure I wasn't anything
[Chorus]
Distractions, reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me
(Yeah!)
[Verse 2]
Clawed away from human clay
We are the broken shards the art disarray
Before you condemn, you rape them,
feed us meconium
Stunt our growth from our souls to our throat, cut!
You shouldn't wall us up with your apathy
But you did, and now you're only growing enemies
This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed
'Cause you made damn sure, now we're everything
[Chorus]
Distractions, reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me!
Much to my surprise, I will wake up
And follow the path of the ones I am made of
But this time... I won't give in
I will save you from my sins
[Interlude]
What is wrong with this?
Manipulation
Violence and chaotic
Go!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Ensconced... ('Onch) in all that's wrong (Wrong)
I slam you shut... (Shut) I can only take so much
How many times do I have to mistreat you?
Constantly biting my hand as I feed you
Maybe now you'll understand severity
I'll sum it up with the best of amount of brevity
Welcome to the transformation
Welcome to annihilation
Welcome to the man that wanted
Everything but couldn't have it!
[Chorus]
Distractions, reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me!
Much to my surprise, I will wake up
And follow the path of the ones I am made of
But this time... I won't give in
I will save you from my sins (Yeah!)
[Outro]
Save you from my sins! (Yeah!)
Oh, save you from my sins!
