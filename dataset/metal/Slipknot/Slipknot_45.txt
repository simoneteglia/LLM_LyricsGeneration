[Verse 1]
Let's skip all the histrionics
Not again, not another excuse
The epidemic is codependent
Biting off more than your mouth can chew
Don't forget to convalesce your secrets
I don't wanna be a man today
For all you know, I'm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going to make you cry tonight
I'm going to make you hate me
[Chorus]
Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you, I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment...
But now it feels like home
[Verse 2]
Your association finds you guilty
Starting with the end of the day
Black and white is such a fascist feeling
Right or wrong, and nothing to say
The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
Unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred
Fuck it all, light the acetylene
[Pre-Chorus]
No other choice, I can't explain
Life keeps taking things away
[Chorus]
Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you, I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment...
But now it feels like home
[Bridge]
The tough guys who came to kill
But stayed to rape and ravage...
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
The future's here, I'm past my prime
When the evidence came, I committed the crime
Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the Bible?
Who could ask for a better disciple?
What's the point? I'm not sure I can
I'll never dig another grave
I'm afraid of what I'll find
If it hurts, then you're too old
I'll take your shit and give you fucking gold
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna make you cry tonight
I need you to hate me
[Chorus]
Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you, I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment...
But now it feels like home
But now it feels like home
