[Verse 1]
I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the everyday
Bullshit things that you have done
Your impossible ego-fuck
Is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fuckin' touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that shit you call a heart...
[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed, made to feel minuscule
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
The only thing you really know about me is...
That's all you'll ever know
[Chorus]
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
[Verse 3]
I'm turning it around like a knife in the shell
I wanna understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lotta reasons to stop it, I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it, at least I admit it
[Chorus]
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah
[Bridge]
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you
I can't fuckin' take it anymore
A snap of the synapse, and now it's fucking war
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you
[Chorus]
I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
I know you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
[Outro]
Well, I know why you blame yourself
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague yourself
