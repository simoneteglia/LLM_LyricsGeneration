[Instrumental Intro]
[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
What happens in the dark feels the way the blackout never does
Turning the gears, sharpen the blades of sheer terror, these fevered ones
But tell me the secret things, show me the bloody kings
Let's play a game where the winners always lose their heads
[Refrain]
Time screams by, life is mine
Time screams by, life is...
Yeah
[Chorus]
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
[Verse 2]
Before it could begin, the shooting stopped, the silence always comes
Now where do we go? Because you're walking the streets, it's no better (There's something wrong)
Pull at your privacy, a product of lunacy
Don't be surprised when the losers want to win... but then again
[Refrain]
Time screams by, life is mine
Time screams by, life is...
Yeah
[Chorus]
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Yeah
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Where does it end and tell me where does it go?
If evil exists, then only evil can know
When do we run and are they letting us in?
Where does it end and tell me where to begin
[Chorus]
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
(Medicine for the dead)
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
Drink me
Your condition is a symptom
We'll have to give you medicine for the dead
You have to drink me
[Outro]
(You know you're
Dying slowly, dying slowly
Dying, dying, right?
Know that you're dying slowly
Dying slowly
Dying, dying right now)
