[Intro: Clown]
Kill me!
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Tattered and torn
Something aches
Tattered and torn
Bad things slither
Tattered and torn
My floors are burning down
Tattered and torn
And I can't find a window
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Tattered and torn
This is medieval
Tattered and torn
This is cerebral
Tattered and torn
Suffocated
Tattered and torn
Melodramatic
[Verse 3: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Tattered and torn
Driven to the verge of
Tattered and torn
I make you my enemy
Tattered and torn
The nerves you sever
Tattered and torn
Can serve you better
[Verse 4: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
Tattered and torn
In the blink of an eye
Tattered and torn
In the space of a second
Tattered and torn
Open my wrists
Tattered and torn
Give me my lessons
[Outro: Corey Taylor &
Clown
]
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me hurt!
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me hurt!
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me hurt!
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me...
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me hurt!
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me hurt!
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me hurt!
(Tearing myself apart)
from the things that make me hurt!
