[Verse 1]
Just stop
Enough of the limitless critical comments
On my life
Just drop
The judgment and all of your pseudo-involvement
In my life
Step back
A moment, and look at the miracle started
In our life
Don't stop
The moment, and let the incredible happen
Knowing that
[Chorus]
All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is forgiveness one more time
To be the best in the world
[Verse 2]
Just stop
With all your little, deliberate problems
With my life
Enough
Of all of the crippling, terrible pain
We feel inside
Step back
A moment, remember how the miracle started
In our life
Take back
The torment, I won't be enjoying this moment
Knowing that
[Chorus]
All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is
Forgiveness one more time
I know that all that we want is to feel inside
Some kind of comfort
And all that we've done, we can't hide
We'll be the best in the world
[Bridge]
All I ever wanted was to be a real source of
Compassion for the moment
That we find ourselves drowning in
All I ever wanted was to be a real source of
Compassion for the moment
That we find ourselves drowning in
[Chorus]
All that you want is to criticize
Something for nothing
And all that I want is
Forgiveness one more time
I know that all that we want is to feel inside
Some kind of comfort
And all that we've done, we can't hide
We'll be the best in the world
We'll be the best in the world
[Outro]
Just stop
Enough of the limitless critical comments
On my life
Just drop
The judgment and all of your pseudo-involvement
In my life
