[Intro]
Ready!
Darkness, cover me
[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm not ready to die, girl
Because of what you don't tell me
I'm not ready to walk inside of where you're taking me
Oh, I'm not ready to die, girl
Because of what you don't tell me
I'm not willing to compromise the man I want to be
[Chorus]
Think you're a little bit closer
To changing me
You're never winning me over
You're wasting time
Think you're a little bit closer
To changing me
You're never winning me over
You're wasting time, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Leave me be
[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm not ready to die, girl
Because of what you don't tell me
I'm never going to toe the line of your conformity
Oh, I'm not ready to die, girl
Because of what you don't tell me
I'm not ready to leave the realm of anonymity
[Chorus]
Think you're a little bit closer
To changing me
You're never winning me over
You're wasting time
Think you're a little bit closer
To changing me
You're never winning me over
You're wasting time, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Wasting time, yeah
Get away from me
[Bridge]
Ready!
[Chorus]
Think you're a little bit closer
To changing me
You're never winning me over
You're wasting time
Think you're a little bit closer
To changing me
You're never winning me over
You're wasting time, yeah
[Outro]
You're wasting time, yeah
You're wasting time, yeah
You're wasting time, yeah
You're wasting time, yeah
