[Intro]
Forgiven to me
You're forgiven to me
You're just another dead man living to me
Forgiven to me
You're forgiven to me
How can you let a dead man live?
[Verse 1]
Forgiven to me
You're forgiven to me
You're just another dead man living to me
Forgiven to me
You're all giving to me
How can you let a dead man live?
Forgiven to me
You're forgiven to me
You're just another nightmare walking to me
You were driven to me
Now you're given to me
How can I let a nightmare live?
[Chorus]
To be purified in fire
Anesthetic for the pain
As the final words erupt from your mouth
Who will remember your name?
[Verse 2]
Forgiven to me
You're forgiven to me
You're just another dead man living to me
Forgiven to me
You're all giving to me
How can you let a dead man live?
Forgiven to me
You're forgiven to me
You're just another nightmare walking to me
You were driven to me
Now you're given to me
No longer will the nightmare live
[Chorus]
To be purified in fire
Anesthetic for the pain
As the final words erupt from your mouth
Who will remember your name?
[Bridge]
Walking the line that the world has drawn
Fighting for balance, alone in the dark
Will you carry the burden the world has grown?
Will you destroy everything in your sight?
You, alone, can give this one more try
You, alone, will bury me tonight
[Chorus]
To be purified in fire
Anesthetic for the pain
As the final words erupt from your mouth
Who will remember you now?
Who will remember your name?
[Outro]
Remember your name
Remember your name
Remember your name (Forgiven to me, you're forgiven to me)
Remember your name (Forgiven to me, you're forgiven to me)
