[Verse 1]
They are the ghosts of innocence
That have awoken from my dreams
Welcome to your nightmare
Say goodbye to everything
All your past obscenities
They have determined where I stand
Echoing cries, in the time that it began
[Pre-Chorus]
Hear me now
Feel my blade
[Chorus 1]
There is no more time for apologies
Malevolent emotions
Take hold of me
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side?
Death is an old friend of mine
[Verse 2]
You can't escape your judgment
I hear them calling out your name
Do not beg for mercy now
You never showed any to them
Embrace your final punishment
There's not a soul to hear you scream
I have to thank you for letting out the animal in me
[Pre-Chorus]
Hear me now
Feel my blade
[Chorus]
There is no more time for apologies
Malevolent emotions
Take hold of me
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side?
Death is an old friend of mine
[Bridge]
The blood became my life
When I was trapped inside
And I can feel the dark passenger calling me
My mother's blood and mine
Uniquely intertwined
Help me, Father, purge the memory from my mind
My hunger to destroy
When I was just a boy
It pulled me deeper into something that I now enjoy
The ritual begins
Evil will meet its end
In your destruction, I will finally feel whole again
[Chorus]
There is no more time for apologies
(There is no more time for apologies)
Malevolent emotions
(Malevolent emotions)
Take hold of me
(Take hold of me)
Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side?
(Are you ready to begin your trip to the other side?)
Death is an old friend of mine
[Outro]
I have become your nightmare
Say goodbye to every thing
