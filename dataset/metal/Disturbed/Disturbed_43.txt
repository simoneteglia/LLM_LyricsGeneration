[Intro]
Fear something again
Fear something again
Fear something again
Fear something again
[Verse 1]
Reject, are you no one? Feel you nothing?
You know, I'll bet you think you have a good
Reason to be living in the limelight
Of the fortunate ones
You're too weakened by the poison that they feed you
In the living lie, they don't believe you
Call to no one, trust in nothing, little impotent one
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be innocent, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me
[Verse 2]
Punk-ass, are you listening? Can you hear me?
Or are you deaf and dumb to my language?
Do the real words seem to hurt you?
Well, put 'em up, motherfucker
You're gonna feel it when I stamp it on your forehead
So you will never forget that you're a reject
And you're no one and you're nothing
Little impotent one
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be innocent, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want innocence, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me
[Post-Chorus]
Fear awaken
Go with it now and let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing
[Bridge]
I don't understand why you don't like me
Why don't you like me? Am I so different from you?
Now, does it scare you that I'm able to discern
What to love and what to burn?
I'll add your fuel to the fire now
Stand back; brother, take your hand back
Leave it and I might crack
More than a smile or two, you see
You don't judge what you don't understand
You can't deny what has been given to me
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be innocent, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want innocence, you know
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be, I don't want to let them hypnotize me
[Post-Chorus]
Fear awaken
Go with it now and let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Go with it now, go with it now
Fear awaken
Go with it now and let it overcome you
Fear awaken
Your mind is racing
Erasing now
[Outro]
Hey, reject, are you no one? Feel you nothing?
You know, I'll bet you think you have a good
Reason to be living in the limelight
Of the fortunate ones, you know
