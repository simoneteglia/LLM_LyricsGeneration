[Intro]
Better yet
Better yet
[Verse 1]
You will remember this moment as you dig into me
And from your smile now it seems as if you liked it
You'd better cherish this moment as you dig into me
You'll never get another chance at this (Better yet)
I won't stand another minute of your questioning me
You hear me, bitch, stop, the interrogation's over
I can't handle the feeling of your pestering me
How would you like to meet my favorite fist (Better yet)
No, you can't renege I love to see you beg
[Chorus]
Dream this moment as you run away
You would only separate me from
What I believe this moment
In brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed
[Verse 2]
It seems your pride has been stolen since you stood up to me
I'll tell you now you know I think I really like it
So learn a lesson from someone who will never repeat
The many tragic mistakes of his past (Better yet)
I hope you savor this moment as you're still on your feet
So keep it quiet now I think you're going to like it
Words have consequences when they're spoken to me
Better be careful when you're writing checks (Better yet)
Don't you question how I stand above you
[Chorus]
Dream this moment as you run away
You would only separate me from
What I believe this moment
In brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed
[Hook]
Better yet
Better yet
[Bridge]
Now you know the answer
Save yourself from danger
I cannot forget how all of this began
I know you know the answers
Save yourself from danger
Beaten by a stranger
Blood still on his hands
[Chorus]
Dream this moment as you run away
You would only separate me from
What I believe this moment
In brutality
You're the one who kept on pushing
'Til I made you bleed
[Outro]
Better yet
Better yet
Better yet
Better yet
