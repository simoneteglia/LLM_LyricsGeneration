[Intro]
Bleeding now, I'm
Crying out, I'm
Falling down and I'm
Bleeding now, I'm
Bleeding now, I'm
Crying out, I'm
Falling down and I'm
Bleeding now
Bleeding now, I'm
Crying out, I'm
Falling down and I'm
Feeling nothing, like
Laughing now, I'm
Stopping now, I'm
Reaching out and I'm
Feeling nothing
[Chorus]
Yeah, you've created a rift within me
Now, there have been several complications
And I'm left with feeling nothing
I might say
You were wrong to take it from me
Left me feeling nothing
[Verse]
Crawling now, I'm
Beaten down, I'm
Tortured now and I'm
Feeling nothing, like
Hunting now, I'm
Stalking now, I'm
Reaching out and I'm
Killing nothing
[Chorus]
Yeah, you've created a rift within me
Now, there have been several complications
And I'm left with feeling nothing
I might say
You were wrong to take it from me
Left me feeling nothing
[Bridge]
Oh, I can feel you ripping and tearing and feeding and growing inside of me
Ripping and tearing and feeding and growing inside of me
I want this
More than you know
I need this
Give it back to me
[Chorus]
You've created a rift within me
You are the cause of these horrid complications
That are ripping and tearing
And feeding and growing
Inside of me
Yeah, you've created a rift within me
Now, there have been several complications
That are ripping, tearing
Feeding, growing
Ripping, tearing
Ripping and tearing and feeding and growing inside of me
[Outro]
I want this
More than you know
I need this
Give it back to me
