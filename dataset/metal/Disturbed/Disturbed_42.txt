[Verse 1]
Thought I was rid of you
Thought it was over with
Thought I was over it
Thought I evicted you from my heart
Kicked you out of my mind
So nothing left of you
Wouldn't be left behind
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, but you still take up all my space
You just won't go away
[Chorus]
You stay in my head
Like an uninvited guest, uninvited guest
You still haunt my heart
Guess you haven't left it yet, haven't left it yet
Ooh, like an uninvited guest
[Verse 2]
Still see you everywhere
You're still in every room
Feel you with every move
I can't go on without erasing you from my heart
Tired of feeling this pain
Seems you're the only ghost
I just can't chase away
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you still inhabit every thought
I prayed that you'd be gone
[Chorus]
You stay in my head
Like an uninvited guest, uninvited guest
You still haunt my heart
Seems you haven't left it yet, haven't left it yet
[Bridge]
I don't want to feel you around
I just want you, want you out
So please, go, please
[Outro Chorus]
You stay in my head
Like an uninvited guest, uninvited guest
You still haunt my heart
Guess you haven't left it yet, haven't left me yet
You stay in my head
Like an uninvited guest, uninvited guest
You still haunt my heart like an uninvited guest
