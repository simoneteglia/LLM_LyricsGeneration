[Verse 1]
Listen, everyone
The time will come when all of us say goodbye
Feel that aching in your heart
Leaving you broken inside
But we're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can
[Verse 2]
Take the ones you love
And hold them close because there is little time
And don't let it break your heart
I know it feels hopeless sometimes
But they're never really gone
As long as there's a memory in your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
So now go do the best things in life
Take a bite of this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Make a ride of this world while you can
[Chorus]
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive
[Pre-Chorus]
So now go do the best things in life
Bring the fight to this world while you can
Make the most of the rest of your life
Shine your light on this world while you can
[Chorus]
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive
And hold on to memories
Hold on to every moment to keep them alive
The world's greatest tragedy
Souls who are not remembered cannot survive
