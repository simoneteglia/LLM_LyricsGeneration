[Intro]
Bold motherfucker
Don't you limit your mind
[Verse]
Liberate your mind, you motherfucker
You're so narrow-minded, so narrow-minded
So liberate your mind, motherfucker
Will you liberate your mind?
Liberate your mind, you motherfucker
You're so narrow-minded, so narrow-minded
So liberate your mind now, motherfucker
Will you liberate your mind this time?
[Pre-Chorus]
Bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the pace has just fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So, bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Now, bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the pace has just fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So, bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind this time
[Chorus]
Waiting for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
Still awaiting I
[Verse]
Liberate your mind, you motherfucker
You're so narrow-minded, so narrow-minded
So liberate your mind, motherfucker
Will you liberate your mind?
Liberate your mind, you motherfucker
You're so narrow-minded, so narrow-minded
So liberate your mind now, motherfucker
Will you liberate your mind this time?
[Pre-Chorus]
Bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the pace has just fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So, bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Now, bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind
Can't you see that the pace has just fallen behind?
All the hate in your heart will be leaving you blind
So, bold motherfucker, don't you limit your mind this time
[Chorus]
Waiting for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
Still awaiting I
[Bridge]
"Out of Zion shall come forth the law
And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem
Nation shall not raise sword against nation
And they shall not learn war anymore
For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken"
[Chorus]
Waiting for your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye
How long will we be waiting
For your modern messiah
To take away all the hatred
That darkens the light in your eye?
[Outro]
Still awaiting I
Still awaiting I
