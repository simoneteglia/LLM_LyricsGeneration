[Verse 1]
You've got nowhere to hide
And all bullshit aside
You've committed a terrible crime
You've stepped over the line and
You'd better be running for your life
Fucked over again
I even called you a friend
A mistake I won't be repeating
I just don't understand
How you even continue to deny
[Pre-Chorus]
You know why
(You don't remember why)
Don't you pretend that you don't know why
(You fuckin' parasite)
[Chorus]
Because your living through association
Has been getting you high
You'd sell your soul
For just a taste of my life
[Verse 2]
Now, what a surprise to discover the lies
You'll be telling again in no time
You just don't realize they'll come back
And be fucking up your life
In trouble again, I just don't understand
This whole pattern that keeps repeating
You know you'll do it again
And admit you can step into the light
[Pre-Chorus]
You know why
(Do you remember why?)
Don't you pretend that you don't know why
(You fuckin' parasite)
[Chorus]
Because your living through association
Has been getting you high
You'd sell your soul
For just a taste of my life
Determination has been running on high
No control for just a taste of my life
[Chorus]
'Cause your association
Has been getting you high
You'd sell your soul
For just a taste of my life
Determination has been running on high
No control for just a taste of my life
For just a taste of my life
[Outro]
You've got nowhere to hide
And all bullshit aside
You've committed a terrible crime
You've stepped over the line and
You'd better be running for your life
(For just a taste of my life)
