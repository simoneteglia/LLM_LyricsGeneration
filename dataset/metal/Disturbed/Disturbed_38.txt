[Verse 1]
Never again will I be dishonored
And never again will I be reminded
Of living within the world of the jaded
They kill inspiration, it's my obligation
To never again allow this to happen
Where do I begin? The choices are endless
Denying the sin
My art, my redemption
I carry the torch of my fathers before me
[Chorus]
The thing I treasure the most in life
Cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why
I will surrender to your advice
To change myself, I'd rather die
Though they will not understand
I won't make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive
[Post-Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
[Verse 2]
Change again cannot be considered
I rage again, dispelling my anger
Where do I begin? The choices are endless
My art, my redemption
My only salvation
I carry the gift that I have been blessed with
My soul is adrift in oceans of madness
Repairing the rift that you have created
I am not alone, brothers, give me your arms now
[Chorus]
The thing I treasure most in life
Cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why
I will surrender to your advice
To change myself, I'd rather die
Though they will not understand
I won't make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive
[Bridge]
I'm no slave, are you feeling brave?
Or have you gone out of your mind?
No more games, it won't feel the same
If I hold my anger inside
There's no meaning; my soul is bleeding
I've had enough of your kind
One suggestion: Use your discretion
Before you label me blind
[Chorus]
The thing I treasure most in life
Cannot be taken away
There will never be a reason why
I will surrender to your advice
To change myself, I'd rather die
Though they will not understand
I won't make the greatest sacrifice
You can't predict where the outcome lies
You'll never take me alive
[Outro]
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
