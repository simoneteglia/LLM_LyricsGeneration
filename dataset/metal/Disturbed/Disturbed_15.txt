[Intro]
Tell me exactly what am I supposed to do
Now that I have allowed you to beat me?
Do you think that we could play another game?
Maybe I could win this time
I kind of like the misery you put me through
Darling, you can trust me completely
If you even try to look the other way
I think that I could kill this time
[Refrain]
Rah, rah!
Rah, rah!
[Verse 1]
It doesn't really seem I'm getting through to you
Though I see you weeping so sweetly
I think that you might have to take another taste
A little bit of hell this time
[Pre-Chorus]
Rah, rah! Lie to me
Rah, rah! Lie to me
[Chorus]
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?
[Verse 2]
You always wanted people to remember you
To leave your little mark on society
Well, don't you know your wish is coming true today?
Another victim dies tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Rah, rah! Lie to me
Rah, rah! Lie to me
[Chorus]
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?
[Bridge]
Is she really
Telling lies again?
Doesn't she realize
She's in danger?
[Chorus]
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day?
Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me?
[Outro]
The little bitch, she went and she told a lie
And now she will never tell another, a lie
The little bitch, she went and she told a lie
Never fucking lie to me!
