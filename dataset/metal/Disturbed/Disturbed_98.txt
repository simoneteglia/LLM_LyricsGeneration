[Verse]
Now you tell me you like it
You tell me you want it
You're mine and you don't need another one
Come on and tell me you like it
And tell me you want it
You're mine and another one to me
Now you tell me you like it
You tell me you want it
You're mine and you don't need another one
Come on and tell me you like it
And tell me you want it
You're mine and the world will get you high
[Pre-Chorus]
What can you take from me
That which you cannot buy?
Exhilaration
Laughing and turning away
What will you take from me
Now that you are inside?
Intoxication
Now are you feeling
[Chorus 1]
Enough to vilify what I love
To sanctify all I hate
Endowed with the need
To carry over the life I lead
[Verse]
Now you tell me you like it
You tell me you want it
You're mine and you don't need another one
Come on and tell me you like it
And tell me you want it
You're mine and another one to me
Now you tell me you like it
You tell me you want it
You're mine and you don't need another one
Come on and tell me you like it
And tell me you want it
You're mine and the world will get you high
[Pre-Chorus]
What can you take from me
That which you cannot buy?
Exhilaration
Laughing and turning away
What will you take from me
Now that you are inside?
Intoxication
Now are you feeling
[Chorus 2]
Enough to vilify what I love
To sanctify all I hate
Endowed with the need
Intoxicating
Enough to vilify what I love
To sanctify all I hate
Endowed with the need
To carry over the life I lead
[Outro]
Now you tell me you like it
You tell me you want it
You're mine and you don't need another one
Come on and tell me you like it
You tell me you want it
You're mine and another one saved
