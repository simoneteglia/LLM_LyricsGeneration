[Verse 1]
Run and hide again
I want to wait this time
Don't wonder why you can't clear this final sin
You know the story was over before it began
[Pre-Chorus]
This is a battle you're not gonna win
Welcome the end
[Chorus]
I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never gonna witness another day
A lonely lifetime planning out your destruction
With no other function, you really don't know
How long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction
With no other function, you really don't know
[Post-Chorus]
You'd better run
[Verse 2]
Ask me why again, nowhere to go this time
Revenge will be mine again
Say goodbye, my friend
Don't run away this time, and die like a man
[Pre-Chorus]
There is no escape from my plan
Welcome the end
[Chorus]
I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never gonna witness another day
A lonely lifetime planning out your destruction
With no other function, you really don't know
How long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction
With no other function, you really don't know
[Bridge]
There is no reprieve
You don't dare to look in my eyes
We'll turn their gaze away in time
[Refrain]
You'd better run
[Chorus]
I've spent a lifetime planning out your destruction
You're never gonna witness another day
A lonely lifetime planning out your destruction
With no other function, you really don't know
How long I've waited for your destruction
I'm telling you, you just can't get away
A whole lifetime planning out your destruction
With no other function, you really don't know
[Post-Chorus]
Welcome the end
[Outro]
Run and hide again
I want to wait this time
Don't wonder why you can't clear this final sin
You know the story was over before it fucking began
