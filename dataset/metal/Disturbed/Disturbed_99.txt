[Intro]
I often wonder why I sit and wait to die
What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning...
"How and why"?
I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!
[Verse 1]
I was a boy who had to live his own way
I never fit into the model they had designed
I chose a path less taken
I stood with others who had often felt the same
We got stares from passersby
Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away
And when the three young boys died
They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie!
No hope in sight
[Chorus]
I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!
[Verse 2]
Why was everybody so damn afraid?
They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime
To justify their own faith
We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time
The three of us were attacked and disgraced
For many hours we were questioned and someone lied
One of us couldn't take it
His simple manner was manipulated in kind
Fear made him lie
[Chorus]
I sit here terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!
[Verse 3]
Now I am terrified!
Can't someone try to bring the truth to light?
Won't anybody open up their eyes?
Before the three of us have lost our lives!
And why?
Can't anybody see through their disguise?!
Only believe we didn't take their lives!
And now the three of us have lost our lives
[Outro]
I often wonder why I sit and wait to die
What have I done to justify the sentence they gave?
Too many hours spent in darkness questioning...
"How and why"?
I can't remember many moments in the light
This retribution has defiled me to no end
An execution without merit looms ahead
Tell me why!
