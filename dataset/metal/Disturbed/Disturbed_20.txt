[Intro]
Release me! Rah!
[Verse 1]
No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely
I try to hide from the unholy sound of it
Another day gone
Another night’s dawn
Dark forces pull me underground
That never went away completely
[Pre-Chorus]
How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me, ah!
[Verse 2]
Will I ever know peace of mind again?
I don’t believe it
I can’t achieve it
I think it all is just another sign
It never went away completely
[Pre-Chorus]
Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me
Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
(Just waiting for the moment when I...)
And feel you die
[Chorus]
In asylum
(I live a lie)
Don’t you know I’m in love with you
And I wasn’t ready
For asylum
(Relive a lie)
To let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
Your asylum
(Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!
[Verse 3]
Death’s images are all around again
They’re right behind me
They’re going to find me
Judgment for the immortal sin
That had enveloped me completely, ah!
I know I’ll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they’ll hear me
They don’t fear me
Punishment for the immoral crime
The debt was never paid completely
[Pre-Chorus]
Terror is coursing in me
(Death inside of me
Keeps a diligent watch on everything)
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
(Keeps a terrible hold on my belief)
(Just waiting for the moment when I...)
And feel you die
[Chorus]
In asylum
(I live a lie)
Don’t you know I’m in love with you
And I wasn’t ready
For asylum
(Relive a lie)
To let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
Your asylum
(Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me, ah!
[Bridge]
In the end, there will be no suffering (more suffering)
In the end, you will find out everything (not anything)
In the end, you may question your belief (what belief?)
In the end, you will realize, finally, how you were deceived
This has gone on too long (too long)
No more demonic dreams
Destroyer, come tonight
Because her memory is killing me
[Chorus]
In asylum
(I live a lie)
I let go, now it’s dragging me
Into your grave
For asylum
(Relive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time (without you)
This world is not fulfilling me, ah!
[Outro]
Don’t think I live in asylum, I live a lie
Don’t want to live in asylum, I’ll live a lie
Don’t think I live in asylum, I live a lie
