[Intro]
You're "never, ever wrong"
No, you're never wrong, never wrong
You're "never, ever wrong"
No, you're never wrong, never wrong
You're "never, ever wrong"
No, you're never wrong, never wrong
You're "never, ever wrong"
No, you're never wrong, never wrong
[Verse 1]
You're "never, ever wrong"
Always something more to say
You're never wrong
Well, you never mind, I'll be fine
You're never wrong
And there's nothing more to say
You're never wrong
It's gonna end this time
You're "never wrong"
You can never be contained
You're never wrong
Well, you never mind, I'll be fine
You're never wrong
Don't even bother to explain
You're never wrong
You'll never win this time
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the anger coming
Feel my patience running
Well, it's plain to see that
You have lost your damn mind
[Chorus]
How could you let it end up this way?
Is there really nothing more you can say?
I'm not taking
Another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So, just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away
[Verse 2]
You're never, ever wrong
And you never will believe
That you were wrong
You'll just never mind and be fine
You're never wrong
Are you really that deceived
The illusion has to end this time
Well, you were wrong
I know it's difficult to see
That you were wrong
In your little mind, every time
Yeah, you were wrong
And now you'd better believe
The game is coming to an end this time
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the anger coming
Feel my patience running
And it's easy to see
You've made me lose my damn mind!
[Chorus]
How could you let it end up this way?
Is there really nothing more you can say?
I'm not taking
Another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So, just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away
[Bridge]
If you shut your mouth
Then we just might make it
You want a fight, be careful
What you're wishing for
So, say it again, push it again
And there is no coming back this time
Shut your mouth
'Cause I just can't take it
I'm ready to fight
Is it all that you were hoping for?
Don't say it againâ€”do it again
There'll be no coming back this time
[Chorus]
How could you let it end up this way?
Is there really nothing more you can say?
I'm not taking
Another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So, just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away
How could you let it end up this way?
Is there really nothing more you can say?
I'm not taking
Another fucking dose of your denial today
I'm not willing to deal with someone
Who insists that they can never be wrong
So, just keep on talking to the wall
Because I'm walking away
[Outro]
You're "never, ever wrong"
No, you're never wrong, never wrong
You're "never, ever wrong"
No, you're never wrong, never wrong
