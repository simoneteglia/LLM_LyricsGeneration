[Verse 1]
My conviction is stronger today
As I fight to uncover your sacred lie
And the fear isn't going away
As the soldiers still die
Let your followers know
That their lives have been sold
For the good of your sacred lie
For the truth to be told
And the plan to unfold
We must start asking why
[Chorus]
Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
[Verse 2]
Liberation, a moral charade
For the cause is a part of your sacred lie
Damnation a moment away
In all the world's eyes
It's the doom of us all
We give in to control
For the sake of your sacred lie
Complications abound
You'll get used to the sound
Of alarms in your life
[Chorus]
Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
[Bridge]
Give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
A moment of peace in our lifetime
Give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
A moment of peace in our lifetime
Give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
A moment of peace in our lifetime
Give us a moment of peace in our lifetime
A moment of peace right now
[Chorus]
Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
Don't you know the war is far from over now?
What a stumbling block we've fallen over now
As our brothers die defending no one
The war is far from over now
