[Intro]
Rawr
[Refrain]
Ah, ah
Burning now I bring you hell
Ah, ah
Oh, burning now I bring you hell
[Verse 1]
Read me tonight
When the warnings said leave a shudder upon you
Running from all that
You feared in your life
Soul of the night
When the sun misled in a horror
Upon you marking the moment
Displaying in my
[Pre-Chorus]
Ghost of a life
And I can’t get 'round the way you left me out in the open
To leave me to die
So how can I
Forget the way you led me through the path into heaven
To leave me behind?
[Chorus]
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you hell
[Refrain]
Ah, ah
Oh, burning now I bring you hell
[Verse 2]
Free me tonight
As the animal kings breathe their terror
Upon you caught in the moment
Engaging in my
[Pre-Chorus]
Bloodlust tonight
Now I can’t control my venom’s flow
Get back from me demon
Or be exorcised
[Chorus]
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you hell
[Bridge]
All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you’ve taken from me
All my emotion and all my integrity
All that you’ve taken from me
[Chorus]
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Soul of the night, I know
Now I can’t stay behind
Save me, from wreaking my vengeance
Upon you, to killing more than I can tell
Burning now I bring you hell
[Refrain]
Ah, ah
Oh, burning now I bring you hell
Ah, ah
Oh, burning now I bring you hell
