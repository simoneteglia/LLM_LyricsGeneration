[Intro: Indistinct Chatter]
[Verse 1]
When I need to spark a bit of inspiration
And the melody feels like it's trapped inside
All I need is a little bit of illumination
So the rhythm can no longer run and hide
Well, I take a puff from the leaves of the devil
And it carries me onto the other side
[Chorus]
Fire it up
I like to fire it up and it feels so right
Fire it up
'Cause when I fire it up, I feel like serenity is mine
[Verse 2]
When I need a little bit of relaxation
My medicine isn't too hard to find
When I'm looking for a bit of rejuvenation
I only partake of the finest kind
And then the mystery begins to unravel
And it helps me break through to the other side
[Chorus]
Fire it up
I like to fire it up and it feels so right
Fire it up
'Cause when I fire it up, I feel like serenity is mine
[Refrain]
Fire it up
Fire it up
[Chorus]
Fire it up (fire it up)
I like to fire it up and it feels so right
Fire it up
'Cause when I fire it up, I feel like serenity is mine
