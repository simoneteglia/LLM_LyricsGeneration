[Verse 1]
Devon won't go to heaven
She's just another lost soul about to be mine again
Leave her, we will receive her
It is beyond your control will you ever meet again
Devon, one of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again
[Pre-Chorus]
Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal
[Chorus]
Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her
[Verse 2]
Sever, now and forever
You're just another lost soul about to be mine again
See her, you'll never free her
You must surrender it all if you'd like to meet again
Fire for your desire
As she begins to turn cold for the final time
You will shiver, 'til you deliver
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again
[Pre-Chorus]
Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal
[Chorus]
Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her
[Hook]
Take me away, yeah
[Chorus]
Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her
[Outro]
Devon, one of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again man
