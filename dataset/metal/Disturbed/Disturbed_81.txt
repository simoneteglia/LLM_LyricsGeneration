[Verse 1]
I see the day that passes by
I develop a new way to hate you
It slowly beckons a love inside
Now I can barely even stand the sight of you
We keep pretending there's nothing wrong
Playing parts in the tragic comedy
Soon we'll be singing a different song
When we both face our harsh reality
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we'll draw battle lines
Fortify our defenses once again
Yeah, we'll look for any sign
We'll meet each other's eyes once again
[Chorus]
They all will hear our battle cries, this venom
It keeps repeating and it's making me realize
We're just not able to survive, this venom
This venom's killing us, and we won't make it out alive
[Verse 2]
I'm used to feeling you're stalking me
I lie awake for the next explosion
With every word always haunting me
I'm never able to let my guard down
I feel the tension begin to rise
I'm tired of living the sick déjà vu again
If we're able to compromise
There's no hope of me getting through again
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we'll draw battle lines
Glorify those defenses once again
Yeah, we'll scream the same old lines
We'll meet each other's eyes and that is when
[Chorus]
They all will hear our battle cries, this venom
It keeps repeating, and it's making me realize
We're just not able to survive, this venom
This venom's killing us, and we won't make it out alive
[Bridge]
This venom
[Chorus]
They all will hear our battle cries, this venom
It keeps repeating, and it's making me realize
We're just not able to survive, this venom
This venom's killing us and we won't make it out alive
No, we won't make it out alive
