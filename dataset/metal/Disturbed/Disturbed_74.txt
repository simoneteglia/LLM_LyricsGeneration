[Verse 1]
In the back of my mind, I can
Barely even remember when
There was nothing left to hide and
She has found a way inside, then
I was forced to walk alone
Living in an empty home
All I wanted was to hide and
Try to numb the ache inside
And I'm still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter at my demise
[Chorus]
Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The infection must die
[Verse 2]
Nothing left but a broken man
Terrified of everything
Nothing left of his foolish pride, his
Fond memories slowly die, then
As he wakes again alone
Still a prisoner in his home
Ready to allow the dark to
Penetrate his broken heart
And he's still afraid of the light
And a thousand voices share their laughter at his demise
[Chorus]
Now if I am to survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast that's been eating me alive
The infection must die
[Bridge]
Kill the motherfucker
[Chorus]
Now if I am to survive, now I must survive
The infection must die
Murder the beast, murder, that's been eating me alive
The infection must die
[Outro]
This is where I draw the line,
now I draw the line
This infection must die,
this infection must die
Give me release from this demon of mine,
demon of mine
The infection must die
The infection must die
