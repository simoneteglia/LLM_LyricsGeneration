[Intro]
Fate is so unkind
Now I should have known
Blind leading the blind
Reaping what I've sown
If it all amounts to nothing
Why then am I standing in this line?
[Verse 1]
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
I may never know for certain
When will be my time
How was I considered evil?
Pleasures taken in this life
Someone granted me reprieval
Decades spent in strife
[Pre-Chorus]
Led to nothing
Repeated in my mind
Led to nothing
If only I was born another time
[Chorus]
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How have I been so determined malign?
[Verse 2]
It's the closing of the curtain
In the play that was my life
Countless chapters left unopened
Tragedies inside
I was fighting for a reason
Holy blessed homicide
Seems I have committed treason
All I've sacrificed
[Pre-Chorus]
Led to nothing
Repeated in my mind
Led to nothing
If only I was born another time
[Chorus]
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How have I been so determined malign?
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How have I been so determined malign?
[Bridge]
Fate is so unkind
Now I should have known
Blind leading the blind
Reaping what I've sown
If it all amounts to nothing
Why, then, am I standing in this line?
[Chorus]
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How have I been so determined malign?
Hell is still overburdened
I must stand and wait in line
Hell is still overburdened
How have I been so determined malign?
