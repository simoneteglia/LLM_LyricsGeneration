[Verse 1]
You're broken, so am I
I'm better off alone
No one to turn to and nothing to call my own
Outspoken, so am I
Explosive words that your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again
You're beaten, so am I
I've got a heart of stone
No medication can cure
What has taken hold
You're hurting, so will I
When I awake and remember why
I've been running from your
[Chorus]
World, dishonored by your world
Your world, I'm haunted by your world
[Verse 2]
My blood is cold as ice
Or so I have been told
Show no emotion and it can destroy your soul
Another sacrifice
To a tormentor your world wouldn't understand
Turn away again
You're angered, so am I
A thousand fires burn
A land of darkness from which I cannot return
You're aching, so will I
When I awake and discover that
I've been damaged by your
[Chorus]
World, dishonored by your world
Your world, I'm haunted by your world
[Bridge]
Never will I be welcomed
Amongst the heartless monsters
You surround yourself with
Feeding of the pain and misfortune of others
A maniacal breed of subhuman parasites
Thrown into a feeding frenzy
With the smell of fresh blood
Open your eyes and see
The creatures for what they are:
A swirling mass of hatred and envy
Don't be naive enough
To think you are unaffected
The conversion has already begun
[Verse 3]
You're frightened, so am I
A world of demons wait
Watching our movements
And filling my heart with hate
You're burning, so will I
When I awake to discover
How I've been ravaged by your
[Chorus/Outro]
World (Ravaged by your world)
Dishonored by your world (Dishonored by your world)
Your world (I'm haunted by your world)
I'm haunted by your world
