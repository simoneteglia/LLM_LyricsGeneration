[Chorus]
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?
[Verse 1]
How do you sleep
When you live with your lies
Out of your mouth
Up from your mind
That kind of thinking starts a chain reaction
You are a time bomb ticking away
You need to release
What you're feeling inside
Let out the beast
That you're trying to hide
Step right up and be a part of the action
Get your game face on because
It's time to play
[Pre-Chorus]
You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up
[Chorus]
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?
[Chorus]
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?
[Verse 2]
How do you live
Without playing the game?
Sit on the side
And expect to keep sane
Step right up and be a part of the action
Come get a piece of it before it's too late
Take a look around
You can't deny what you see
We're living in a violent society
Well, my brother, let me show you a better way
Now get your game face on, because
It's time to play
[Pre-Chorus]
You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up
[Chorus]
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?
[Chorus]
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?
[Bridge]
So, tell me, what am I supposed to be?
Another goddamn drone?
Tell me, what am I supposed to be?
Should I leave it on the inside?
Tell me, what am I supposed to be?
Another goddamn drone?
Tell me, what am I supposed to be?
Should I get ready to play?
[Pre-Chorus]
You're pushing and fighting your way
You're ripping it up
[Chorus]
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?
[Chorus]
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life
If you've ever known anyone
Bring the violence
It's significant
To the life, can you feel it?
