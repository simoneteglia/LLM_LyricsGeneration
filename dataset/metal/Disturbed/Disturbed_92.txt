[Intro]
Nah-ah, nah
Gettin' in, gettin' in, gettin' in, gettin' into now
Gettin' in, gettin' in to come take over me
Gettin' in, gettin' in, gettin' in, gettin' into now

Gettin' in, gettin' in to come take over me
Gettin' in, gettin' in, gettin' in, gettin' into now
Gettin' in, gettin' in to like me
[Verse 1]
Time, not having an easy time
Never gonna have an easy time
Giving the runaround to me
I can feel it coming around again
Time, changing, a-wasting
Come and get up in my face again this time
Giving the runaround to me
And I'm not having an easy
[Pre-Chorus]
Time, never having an easy
In all this time, it has never gone easy
Time, not having an easy
You'll never meet another like me
[Chorus]
Gettin' in, gettin' in to like me, like me
Gettin' in, gettin' in to like me, like me
Gettin' in, gettin' in to lie to me like me
Gettin' in, gettin' in to like me, like
[Verse 2]
Time, not having an easy time

Come and get up in my face again this time
Giving the runaround to me
And I'm not having an easy
[Pre-Chorus]
Time, never having an easy
In all this time, it has never gone easy
Time, not having an easy
You'll never meet another like me

Get ready
Time, never gonna die
Never gonna give in to me
You want a deity like me
You want a god
But you're never gonna give in to me
You want a deity like me
Time, never gonna die
Never gonna give in to me
You want a deity like me
You want a god
But you're never gonna give in to me
You want a deity like me
[Chorus]
Time, gettin' in, gettin' in
Time, just another god of the mind
Time, gettin' in, gettin' in
Time, just another god of the mind
[Outro]
Time, never having an easy
In all this time, it has never gone easy
Time, not having an easy
You'll never meet another like me
