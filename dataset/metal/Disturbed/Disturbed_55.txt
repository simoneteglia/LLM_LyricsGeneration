[Intro]
You've been caught in a lie
You can't deny it
[Verse 1]
So, let the war begin
You're far from innocent
Hell, I just don’t know where it will end
You are the one to blame
You’ve made a habit of fucking up my life
Another fallacy
Is laid in front of me
Now I just don't know what to believe
Another animal
Sent to devour whatever’s left inside
(I know now)
[Chorus]
It’s all been a lie
And I’ll never come to know why
Awoke to discover you leaving me now
It’s all been a lie
I don’t ever want to know why
You’ve mastered the art of deceiving me now
[Verse 2]
A mortal enemy
Has been revealed to me
How come I wasn’t able to see?
Another vampire
Getting a fix from sucking up my life
An evil entity
Had taken hold of me
Ripped out my heart
And started to feed
I still remember when
I thought that all you were eating was my pride
(I know now)
[Chorus]
It’s all been a lie
And I’ll never come to know why
Awoke to discover you leaving me now
It’s all been a lie
I don’t ever want to know why
You’ve mastered the art of deceiving me now
[Verse 3]
This idiot won't let me go
Slowly penetrating the mind
I tell you now, my little puppet
You'll suffer me
You don't want to let me go
Till I've taken over your life
I’ll ensure you survive
Little puppet, don't die
Let me, let me die
Little puppet, don't die
Let me, let me die
Little toy, don't die
[Chorus]
It’s all been a lie
And I’ll never come to know why
Awoke to discover you leaving me now
It’s all been a lie
I don’t ever want to know why
You’ve mastered the art of deceiving me now
It’s all been a lie
And I’ll never come to know why
Awoke to discover you leaving me now
It’s all been a lie
I don’t ever want to know why
You’ve mastered the art of deceiving me now
