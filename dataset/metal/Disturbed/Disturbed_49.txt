[Verse 1]
Sensation washes over me
I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago
I don't remember
Tear a hole so I can see
My devastation
Feelings from so long ago
I don't remember
[Pre-Chorus]
Holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind the mask this time
And try to believe
[Verse 2]
Blind your eyes to what you see
You can't embrace it
Leave it well enough alone
And don't remember
Cut your pride and watch it bleed
You can't deny it
Pain you know you can't ignore
I don't remember
[Pre-Chorus]
Holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind the mask this time
And try to believe
[Chorus]
If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me
[Bridge]
Sensation washes over me
I can't describe it
Pain I felt so long ago
I don't remember
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just holding on to let them know
What's given to me, given to me
To hide behind the mask this time
And try to believe
[Chorus]
If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me
[Outro]
Into me
Into me
