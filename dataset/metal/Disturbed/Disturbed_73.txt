[Verse 1]
See the dogs come running
Smelling blood now
To an open sore
On a parasite
Countless hearts have fallen
Hard to number
Damnation's whore
Is looking for a victim tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
With an angry soul
And a wicked design
Your will cannot endure
And your heart is torn away
[Chorus]
I was caught up in the moment
We were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be all right
I had given up control and
I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
[Verse 2]
Damn what I'm becoming
One of them now
Just an opened door
On an endless night
Dark desire burning
In my blood now
How can I be sure?
I don't know if I'll be able to fight
[Pre-Chorus]
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
As my heart is torn away
[Chorus]
I was caught up in the moment
We were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be all right
I had given up control and
I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
[Bridge]
Now that I've been torn apart
Will there be an end to this?
Will there finally be release?
Will I finally rest in peace?
I'm determined to believe
My prayers will be received
[Pre-Chorus]
With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
As my heart is torn away
[Chorus]
I was caught up in the moment
We were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be all right
I had given up control and
I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
[Outro]
The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Evil personified
Your heart is serpentine
