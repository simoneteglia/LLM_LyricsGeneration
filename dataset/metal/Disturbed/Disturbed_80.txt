[Verse 1]
All your life, you just stood there questioning
Feeling your ambition crumble away
As the power within you began to decay
Never finding what you were searching for
And feeling a longing you couldn't ignore
You felt it ache inside like never before
[Pre-Chorus]
Take the path that the weak ones demonize
Look around and begin to realize
[Chorus]
That you're no longer alone tonight
You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight
[Verse 2]
The burden you bear can cripple you
A ravenous cancer, eating your soul
Lost within a world beyond your control
So tonight, let there be a reckoning
Let this moment empower you to no end
Let the doubts within you start to descend
[Pre-Chorus]
Take the path that the weak ones demonize
Look around and begin to realize
[Chorus]
That you're no longer alone tonight
You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight
That you're no longer alone tonight
Become the heir to the throne tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight
[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ow, ow, ow!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ow, ow, ow!
[Chorus]
That you're no longer alone tonight
You're coming into your own tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight
That you're no longer alone tonight
Become the heir to the throne tonight
One of the brave and the bold tonight
