[Intro]
My Mistress
[Verse 1]
I stand on the brink of your mind
Living inside a nightmare from which
I just cannot awaken
Stand on the edge of your life
Just give me another moment
From which I will never awaken
[Chorus]
Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden
To idolize
Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in
[Bridge]
My Mistress
[Verse 2]
To stand on the edge of the knife
Cutting through the nightmare from which
I just cannot awaken
Stand on the edge of the night
Living inside a moment
From which I will never awaken
[Chorus]
Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden
To idolize
Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in
[Bridge]
Look at what you've done to me
You've become my enemy
Poisoning the world for me
Take away my everything
Weakened as I am
Never awaken
[Chorus]
Stand on the brink of my own demise
Fallen again for another
Mistress of burden
To idolize
Hoping that one of them will decide
To let me in
[Outro]
My Mistress
Decide to let me in
My Mistress
Decide to let me in
