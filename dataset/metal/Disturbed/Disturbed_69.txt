[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to give my soul away
To have the life I thought that everybody wants
And I need to let you know I was wrong
It's a shame
They stole my heart and took control away
And when I lost the life that everybody wants
Well, you'd think they'd help you out
But they don't give a damn
[Chorus]
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
You take your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
They light that spark
(You can't fight it)
Then sit back and watch you burn
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
Give you your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
When your world goes dark
(You can't hide it)
They'll just smile and watch you burn
[Verse 2]
You can't believe a single word they say
You tried to have the life that everybody wants
Pretty soon you'll figure out that you don't
It's a scam
You're torn apart, and then you're thrown away
And you become the one that everybody talks
By then there's no way out
It's all part of the plan
[Chorus]
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
You take your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
They light that spark
(You can't fight it)
Then sit back and watch you burn
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
Give you your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
When your world goes dark
(You can't hide it)
They'll just smile and watch you burn
They lift you up
You take your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
They light that spark
(You can't fight it)
Then sit back and watch you burn
They lift you up
(You might feel it, but don't believe it)
Give you your turn
(You'll see it, when you achieve it)
When your world goes dark
(You can't hide it)
They'll just smile and watch you burn
