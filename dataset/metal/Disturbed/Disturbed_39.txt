[Intro]
Never again
Never again
[Verse 1]
They had a frightening desire for genocide
They wouldn't stop 'til what was left of my family died
Hell-bent on taking over the world
You couldn't hide in the shroud of conformity
We can't forget how we were devastated by the beast
And how we pleaded with our captors for release
We were hunted for no reason at all
One of the darkest times in our history
[Chorus]
All that I have left inside
Is a soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again
Their depraved society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me never again
Not again
[Verse 2]
A generation that was persecuted endlessly
Exterminated by the Nazi war machine
We will remember, let the story be told
To realize how we lost our humanity
You dare to tell me that there never was a Holocaust?
You think that history will leave their memory lost?
Another Hitler using fear to control
You're gonna fail this time for the world to see
[Chorus]
All that I have left inside
Is a soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again
Their depraved society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me never again
Not again
[Chorus]
All that I have left inside
Is a soul that's filled with pride
I tell you never again
Their depraved society
Didn't end up killing me
Scream with me never again
[Verse 3]
For the countless souls who died
Let our voices fill this night
Sing with me, never again
They aren't lost you see
The truth will live in me
Believe me, never again
