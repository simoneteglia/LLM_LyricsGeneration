[Intro]
Shout!
[Chorus]
Heavy, you want it heavy
Welcome to my world, feel the weight of it
Grinding down and heavy
I want it heavy
Welcome to my world, feel the weight of it
Grinding down again
[Verse 1]
Gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me
To a world devoid of light
To another time, to another place
And let the broken ones taste my misery
Rip away the disguise and
You will realize that you find
The truth is sickening
We don't need to change that, really
I kind of like it ugly
[Pre-Chorus]
Leave it, make it
Binding, seething, blinding, screaming, and
[Chorus]
Heavy, you want it heavy
Welcome to my world, feel the weight of it
Grinding down and heavy
I want it heavy
Welcome to my world, feel the weight of it
Grinding down again
[Verse 2]
Gather your psychotic masses and bring them to me
To a world devoid of sanity
Another time and another place
And let the violent ones crave calamity
Rip away the disguise and
You will realize that you find
The truth is sickening
We don't need to change that, really
I kind of like it ugly
[Pre-Chorus]
Leave it, make it
Binding, seething, blinding, screaming
[Bridge]
The face of the mother culture is sickening
The rape of the mother culture is nearing
The face of the mother culture is sickening
The rape of the mother is bloody likely
Bleeding now (one, two, three, four!)
The face of the mother culture is sickening
The rape of the mother culture is nearing
The face of the mother culture is sickening
The rape of the mother is bloody likely
Bleeding now (one, two, three, four!)
[Outro]
Heavy, you want it heavy
Welcome to my world, grinding down and heavy
I want it heavy
Feel the weight of it grinding
Heavy, you want it heavy
You want it heavy, you want it heavy
