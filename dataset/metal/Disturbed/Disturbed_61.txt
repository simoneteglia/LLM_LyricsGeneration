[Verse 1]
Don't turn away
I pray you've heard
The words I've spoken
Dare to believe
Oh, for one last time
[Chorus]
And then I'll let
The darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
[Verse 2]
Carry me away
I need your strength
To get me through this
Dare to believe
Oh, for one last time
[Chorus]
And then I'll let
The darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
[Post-Chorus]
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
[Interlude]
Dare to believe
Oh, for one last time
[Chorus]
And then I'll let
The darkness cover me
Deny everything
Slowly walk away
To breathe again
On my own
On my own
