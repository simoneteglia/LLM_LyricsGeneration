[Verse 1]
Still enough
Although I know you’re not begging
Still as the thoughts running through your mind
Still enough
Although I know you’re not begging
Give me a reason to make you mine
[Chorus]
I will devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you’ve brought meaning to my life
[Verse 2]
Had enough
Although I see you’re not running
Still are the thoughts running through your mind
Dead to love
The path that you are now taking
Show me the reason to make you mine
[Chorus]
I will devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you’ve brought meaning to my life
[Bridge]
Run to where the smallest ray of light will never find you
Run to where you will not need to shield your eyes
Run away from all the soulless, heartless fiends who hound you
Run away and let your memories go blind, when I
[Chorus]
Devour you
Take all the pain away
I cannot stay my hand
From reaching out so that I can
Empower you
For all eternity
It seems to ease my mind
To know that you’ve brought meaning to my life
