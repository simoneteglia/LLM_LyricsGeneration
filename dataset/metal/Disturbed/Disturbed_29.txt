[Intro]
[Automated Voice:] Hello. Please leave a message after the tone
[Bob Sanders, R.I.P.:]
Hey, just calling you back
I'm feeling pretty good today actually, didn't throw up at all
Yeah, tomorrow, I got this procedure
I think everything is gonna go smooth there, though
Um, I'm hoping anyway
I need some good news for once
[Verse 1]
Don't wanna hear it's over
What a rude awakening
The angel of death has come
And ripped you from our lives
I can't stand the devastation
Relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you
On the other side
[Pre-Chorus]
Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right
[Chorus]
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore
[Verse 2]
What faith I had is broken
And I question everything
And those shards of doubt
Begin to penetrate my heart
With every waking hour
Within everything I see
The shadows of your loss
Are tearing me apart
[Pre-Chorus]
Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right
[Chorus]
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore
[Interlude]
[Automated Voice:] We're sorry
This mailbox is full and cannot take your messages
[Bridge]
My world is shattered, in disarray
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say, in time, the pain goes away
But in my soul, it will forever stay
[Chorus]
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind
Your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear
Your laughter anymore
[Outro]
[Automated Voice:] We're sorry
You have reached a number that is no longer in service
