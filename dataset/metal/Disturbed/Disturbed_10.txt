[Intro]
Ow, ow, ow
[Refrain]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy
[Chorus]
Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold
And all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that
You're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind
[Refrain]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy
[Chorus]
Then, you slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold
And all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that
You're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind
[Bridge]
If I scare you now, don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see?
Said, if I scare you now, don't run from me
I've been hiding my pain, you see?
[Chorus]
You slowly recall all your mind
Why your soul's gone cold
And all hope has run dry
Dead inside
Never enough to forget that
You're one of the lonely
Slowly recall all your mind
Then, slowly recall all your mind
[Refrain]
Say, yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Don't they know that you're full of pain already?
Yes, they know that you've hurt yourself another time
Decadence isn't easy, is it?
