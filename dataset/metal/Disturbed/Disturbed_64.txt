[Verse 1]
Goddamn maybe I am a little paranoid
'Cause I can feel it getting harder to breathe
I really don't know when it began to be unbearable
But now it's sickening me
[Pre-Chorus]
Because the world keeps burning
And they keep turning the page
They love the drama
So pardon me if I don't give a
Goddamn bit about anything you're telling me
It's just a matter of fact
[Chorus]
All of the best ones lie
And you're never gonna get me to see your side
I'm telling you all the best ones lie
And there's nothing you can say that will change my mind
So how about you don't even try?
[Verse 2]
Goddamn maybe I am a little terrified
You know I really don't know what to believe
We watch the world die while they keep telling us
There's nothing to fear, so now it's crippling me
[Pre-Chorus]
Because the world keeps turning
And all people do is complain
They love the drama
Reality is they don't care a
Goddamn bit about anything you're telling me
It's just as simple as that
[Chorus]
All of the best ones lie
And you're never gonna get me to see your side
I'm telling you all the best ones lie
And there's nothing you can say that will change my mind
So how about you don't even try?
[Bridge]
No!
You're not ready!
[Chorus]
All of the best ones lie
And you're never gonna get me to see your side
I'm telling you all the best ones lie
And there's nothing you can say that will change my mind
Remember now, all of the best ones lie
And you'll never get me to see your side
So how about you don't even try?
[Outro]
Yeah!
All of the best ones lie
But now it's sickening me
But now it's sickening me
Goddamn maybe I am, yeah, maybe I am
