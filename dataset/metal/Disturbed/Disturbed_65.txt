[Verse 1]
Fading, falling, lost in forever
Will I find a way to keep it together
Am I strong enough to last through the weather
In the hurricane of my life?
Can it be a conscious decision
That I look for ways to alter my vision?
Am I speeding towards another collision
In the alleyways of my life?
[Pre-Chorus]
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen in
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen in
[Chorus]
Please, believe me
That my eyes deceive me
Don't stand me up, just leave me
I have fallen again, this is the end
Pain redefined
[Verse 2]
Shaking, burning up with the fever
In the realm of pain, I am the deceiver
Now, I lie to myself, so I can believe her
As she disassembles my life
I cannot dispel the illusion
All my hopes and dreams are drowned by confusion
Can I find a way to make a solution
That will reconfigure my life?
[Pre-Chorus]
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen in
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Memories don't lie
You know better than
Those who have fallen in
[Chorus]
Please, believe me
That my ears deceive me
Don't stand me up, just leave me
I have fallen again, this is the end
Pain redefined
[Bridge]
And I know that stillness shatters
We have all been frightened by the sound
Of footsteps on the pavement of our lives
I stand and fight
I'm not afraid to die
Elochai, bury me tonight
[Chorus]
Please, believe me
That the world deceives me
Don't stand me up, just leave me
I have fallen again, this is the end
Pain redefined
