[Intro]
Nah-ah, nah-ah
Now
[Verse 1]
I can feel the animal inside
And my resolve is weakening
Pounding at the doors of my mind
It's nearly overpowering
I cannot begin to describe
The hunger that I feel again
Run, if you intend to survive
[Pre-Chorus]
For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night
[Chorus]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine
In hell tonight
[Verse 2]
I can hear it calling again
The primal need is filling me
Changes are about to begin
And now my blood is boiling
I can see the fear in your eyes
But you can't bring yourself to scream
Time to shed the mortal disguise
[Pre-Chorus]
For the beast is coming to life
Taking form in the glimmer of this tainted moonlight
Death approaches on this night
[Chorus]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine
In hell tonight
[Verse 3]
We begin the hunt and I
Feel the power course, as the creatures take flight
For the kill is close and I
Will be satisfied
For the smell of fear tonight
Wakes an ancient lust
That will not be denied (You're mine)
[Chorus]
For the animal's soul is mine
We will be completed right before your eyes
I have no control this time
And now we both shall dine
In hell tonight
[Outro]
For the animal's soul is mine
And the world around will never hear your cries
An unholy crime
And now we both shall dine
In hell tonight
