[Verse 1]
Get up again, turn it on again
Stare and try to find some meaning
Let the day begin
But you feel that urge in your mind
You stumble in, still holding it
You move like an electric zombie
Barely noticing
As your life keeps passing you by
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this?
Can we even be saved?
[Chorus]
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life?
In another time, in another time
[Verse 2]
So it's 3 am, turn it on again
You never seem to stop completely
Keep checking in
On the "friends" that you've left behind
Always jumping in, any argument
Seems everybody here knows everything
You know you'll never win
But you're certainly losing your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I still can remember a time when it wasn't like this
Before the world became enslaved
Can we all go back to the time when we were not like this?
Can we even be saved?
[Chorus]
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life?
In another time, in another time
[Bridge]
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
[Chorus]
In another time when we weren't so blind
When the world was more than what we see online
When we actually lived instead of watching life?
In another time, in another time
In another time, will we still be blind?
Because there's so much more than what we see online
Will we actually live instead of watching life?
In another time, in another time
[Outro]
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
Reconnect again, disconnect again, over again
