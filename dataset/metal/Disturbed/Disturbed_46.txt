[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm a-talking to you
So, come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
[Verse 1]
In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know
(They just don't know)
Those one-track minds
That took you for a working whore
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
(Jump, jump, jump, jump)
You shouldn't have to shout for joy
[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
[Verse 2]
They gave you life
And in return, you gave them hell
As cold as ice
(Now, bitch, you're ice, ice, baby)
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to shout the tale
[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
[Bridge]
Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it
[Verse 3]
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
(Break, break, break, break, break)
I'd really love to break your heart
[Chorus]
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'd really love to shout, shout!
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm a-talking to you
So, come on
[Outro]
Shout!
Shout!
Come on, le-let me shout, shout, let me
Come on, le-let me shout, shout
Shout!
Come on, le-let me shout, shout, let me
Come on, le-let me shout, shout
Shout!
