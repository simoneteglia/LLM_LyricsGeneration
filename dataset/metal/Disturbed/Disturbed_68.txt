[Intro]
Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
Why does it sound like the devil is laughing
Leaving me haunted tonight
You did decide
[Verse 1]
Now I want you when you're gone, and now it's like
You're holding something just in front of me
Well, then, I can't allow this to become another
One of those times that I'm left in the cold dead
There's no compromise
Just another tie
I know I need to sever
[Chorus]
Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
Why does it sound like the devil is laughing
Leaving me haunted tonight
You did decide
[Verse 2]
Ever haunted by the trappings of this life
Sweet redemption just in front of me
Well, now, it seems, once again, that I've lost another
One of the ones that have broke through the wall damned
Fate won't compromise
I have sold my soul
And now the devil's laughing
You did decide
[Bridge]
You were bold and strong and ready to begin your life
All for nothing, you were sacrificed
You began alone, and so it will be when you die
All for nothing, will you be remembered?
You did decide
[Outro]
Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
So, now you know why the devil is laughing
He left you with nothing tonight
You did decide
