[Intro]
Get psycho
I wanna get psycho
Get psycho
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
[Verse 1]
Wanna get psycho
Run, you little bitch
I want your power glowing, juicy, flowing, red hot
Meaning of life
It's not enough to have a little taste
I want the whole damn thing
Now, can you dig it?
Need to get psycho
I want to hear you say it
Say you want it, need it
Don't wanna wait until we finish the show
It's not enough; you hunger for more
You're one twisted little fuck
And now you wanna get psycho with me
[Pre-Chorus]
Give in, give in, decide
Give in, give in, give in, decide
Give in, give in, give in, DECIDE
Give in, give in, give in, DECIDE
Give in
[Chorus]
Get psycho
I wanna get psycho
Get psycho
I wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
[Verse 2]
Wanna get psycho
Scratch my itch
Give me your power flowing, juicy, glowing, red hot
Meaning of life
It's not enough to have a little piece
I want the whole damn thing
Now, can you dig it?
Need to get psycho
I want to hear you scream
Tell me to take you, scare you, fuck you
After we finish the show
It's not enough
You listening, whore?
You're one twisted little fuck
And now you wanna get psycho with me
[Pre-Chorus]
Give in, give in, decide
Give in, give in, give in, decide
Give in, give in, give in, DECIDE
Give in, give in, give in, DECIDE
Give in
[Bridge]
I can feel the blood flowing through my veins
Spilling on my soul
And now the hunger's getting bigger
Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
And pull my trigger
Free the violence that is building in me
I say now, end of the ride, murder-suicide
Is how I've been feeling lately
Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
I'm reeling with the feeling that I
Can't ignore
Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
I'm reeling with the feeling that I
Can't ignore
Come a little closer now, pretentious whore
I'm reeling with the feeling that I
Can't ignore
And the need to get psycho
Is not a question to me
[Outro]
Get, get, get, get, get psycho
Get, get, get, I wanna get psycho
Get, get, get, get, get psycho
Get, get, get, I wanna, wanna, wanna
Get psycho
(Psycho)
Get, get, get, I wanna get psycho
(Psycho)
Get, get, get, get, get psycho
(Psycho)
Get, get, get, I wanna get psycho
Wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
