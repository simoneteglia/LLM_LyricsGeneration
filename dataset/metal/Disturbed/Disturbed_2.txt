[Intro]
Can you feel that?
Ah, shit
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
[Verse 1]
Drowning deep
In my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of
My human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)
[Pre-Chorus]
Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes
Violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon
In me
[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me
[Verse 2]
I can see inside you
The sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that
Was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)
[Pre-Chorus]
It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes
Living with these changes
Oh, no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon
In me
[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me
[Post-Chorus]
And when I dream
And when I dream
And when I dream
And when I dream
[Bridge]
No, Mommy, don't do it again
Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No, Mommy, don't hit me, ah
Why did you have to hit me like that, Mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me, ah-ah
Why did you have to be such a bitch?
Why don't you? Why don't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just fuck off and die?
Why can't you just leave here and die?
Never stick your hand in my face again, bitch
Fuck you, I don't need this shit
You stupid, sadistic, abusive, fucking whore
How would you like to see how it feels, Mommy?
Here it comes, get ready to die
[Interlude]
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness has now come over me
