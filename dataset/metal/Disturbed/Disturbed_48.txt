[Intro]
Are you ready?
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
[Verse 1]
Well, are you ready now for the revolution?
For too long your power has been taken away, it's been taken away
Does your heart feel heavy now? Savor the solution
Take those mental shackles off and throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind
[Verse 2]
Moving steady now, it's a revelation
For so long your focus has been taken away, now you're breaking away
They may think they know you, but here's an education
No, they can't control you once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind
When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for
[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon
[Verse 3]
That's enough already now, you don't wanna take it
All your reservations have been taken away, they've been taken away
So you think you're ready now for the revolution?
Yeah, they can't control you once you've broken away
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for
[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?
[Bridge]
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for
[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
Let me know you're ready to be turned into people who cannot be preyed upon
[Chorus]
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
We cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
