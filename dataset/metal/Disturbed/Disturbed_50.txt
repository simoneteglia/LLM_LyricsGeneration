[Verse 1]
Now, we have come
Far too many times
To celebrate this death
That soon some will forget
And we mourned
Far too many times
To celebrate this death
I'm not ready for this yet
[Chorus]
Is she already gone?
Can we call her back again?
Is she already gone?
Will she find me in the end?
[Verse 2]
Pain left me numb
Far too many times
To celebrate this death
I never will forget
And we spoke
Oh so many times
The words we never said
Are the ones I most regret
[Chorus 2]
Is he already gone?
Can we call him back again?
Is he already gone?
Will I find him in the end?
[Chorus 3]
Are they already gone?
Can we call them back again?
Are they already gone?
Will I find them in the end?
[Outro]
Are they already gone?
Are they already gone?
Are they already gone?
Will I find them in the end?
Will I find them in the end?
