[Intro]
Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind
Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind
[Break]
Hit it
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
[Verse 1]
Criminal, this suffering
It makes me think like a
Criminal, the suffering
When we’re alone
Criminal, this suffering
It makes me feel like a
Criminal, the suffering
When we’re alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To bury my vision?
The hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close that door once and for all
[Chorus]
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
[Interlude]
It seems the whole experience is
[Verse 2]
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more than
Physical, beyond belief
When we’re alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision?
Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all
[Chorus]
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
[Bridge]
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me “motherfucker”
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me “motherfucker”
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now
Now, now you want to know
Now you want a name
Now you want a place
Now you want a time
Now you want it all
Now you want to know
Now you want a name
Now you want a place
Now you want a time
Now you want it all, now
[Chorus]
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t say that it isn’t so
I’m on a path that you’ll never comprehend
Set me free me from all of this
I need you to quicken my end
