[Verse 1]
One more goddamn day
When I know what I want and my want
Will be considered tonight, ha
Consider tonight, ha
Just another day
When all that I want will mark me
As a sinner tonight, ha
I'm a sinner tonight, yeah
[Chorus]
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air
[Verse 2]
Power unrestrained
Dead on the mark
Is what we will deliver tonight, ha
Deliver tonight, ha
Pleasure fused with pain
This triumph of the soul
Will make you shiver tonight, ha
We'll make you shiver tonight, yeah
[Chorus]
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air
[Bridge]
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
We are the ones that will open your mind
Leave the weak and the haunted behind
[Chorus]
People can no longer cover their eyes
If this disturbs you, then walk away
You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of
Ten thousand fists in the air
[Outro]
A-a-a-a-a-air
Ten thousand fists in the air
A-a-a-a-a-air
Ten thousand fists in the air
