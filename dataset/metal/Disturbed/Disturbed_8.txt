[Verse 1]
Like an unsung melody
The truth is waiting there for you to find it
It's not a blight, but a remedy
A clear reminder of how it began
Deep inside your memory
You turned away as you struggled to find it
You heard the call as you walked away
A voice of calm from within the silence
And for what seemed an eternity
You waited hoping it would call out again
You heard the shadow beckoning
Then, your fear seemed to keep you blinded
You held your guard as you walked away
[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light
[Verse 2]
An unforgivable tragedy
The answer isn't where you think you'd find it
Prepare yourself for the reckoning
For when your world seems to crumble again
Don't be afraid, don't turn away
You're the one who can redefine it
Don't let hope become a memory
Let the shadow permeate your mind
And reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
So that the door can be opened again
Within your darkest memories
Lies the answer, if you dare to find it
Don't let hope become a memory
[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light
[Bridge]
Sickening, weakening
Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul
You need strengthening, toughening
It takes an inner dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
Ignite the fire within you
[Chorus]
When you think all is forsaken
Listen to me now (All's not forsaken)
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light
[Outro]
Don't ignore, listen to me now
You need never feel broken again
Sometimes, darkness can show you the light
