[Verse 1]
You are enemy
You are my hated enemy
I am enemy
Number-one rated enemy
I'm a-labeled enemy
I am your mortal enemy
My actions, enemy
Make me your bitter enemy
[Chorus]
All the world around, enemy (ow, ow!)
They're tearing up the ground, enemy (ow, ow!)
They're drawn in by the sound
Enemy, enemy, I must eliminate my enemy
(Ow, ow!) Enemy
(Ow, ow!) Enemy
Enemy, enemy, I must eliminate my enemy
[Verse 2]
Your people, enemy
My people's hated enemy
What are you, enemy
Though a created enemy
Terminate the enemy
Eradicate the hated enemy
I am an enemy
My very greatest enemy
[Chorus]
All the world around, enemy (ow, ow!)
They're tearing up the ground, enemy (ow, ow!)
They're drawn in by the sound
Enemy, enemy, I must eliminate my enemy
(Ow, ow!) Enemy
(Ow, ow!) Enemy
Enemy, enemy, I must eliminate my enemy
[Bridge]
You try to tell me that you love life
Then find another way to kill life
You try to tell me that you love life
Then find another way to kill life
You try to tell me you love life
Then find another way to kill life
You try to tell me that you love life
Then find another way to kill
Wanting, love life
Needing, kill life
Wanting, love life
Needing, kill your
Enemy
