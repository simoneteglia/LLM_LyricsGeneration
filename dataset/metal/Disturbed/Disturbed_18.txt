[Verse 1]
The monster shattered the day
In a place where innocents play
I was mourning as the headlines shouted his name
They didn't waste any time
I was disgusted when the madman's image appeared at the top of the screen
Some were barely alive
Too many didn't survive
Still they kept repeating headlines shouting the name
Do they not realize
The future demons with the hope of becoming the one at the top of the screen?
[Pre-Chorus]
They've thrown morality away
With such depravity, I must say
[Chorus 1]
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life
[Verse 2]
The pictures drove me insane
Can't get them out of my brain
You made certain they were right at the top of the page
You disrespected the dead
When the only name was of the one who committed the murder at the top of the page
The madman watching with glee
As the herd of innocents flee
They saw it all unfold right on the face of the screen
Perhaps they could be the one
Who'd become famous for the acts of terror reflected on the face of the screen?
[Pre-Chorus]
They've thrown morality away
With such depravity, I must say
[Chorus 2]
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life
And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane
The damage you caused, you cannot rectify
You've inspired new legions of monsters determined to take more life
[Bridge]
Take a look around
Listen to the sound
Feel it on the ground
Fear has come in a wave
Just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave
Listen to me now
Are you with me now
Can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them
Let's defy them
Take a look around
Listen to the sound
Feel it on the ground
Fear has come in a wave
Just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave
Listen to me now
Are you with me now
Can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them
Let's defy them
[Chorus 2]
You made sure the world will remember the name
But didn't the thought even enter your mind
You'd give a new legion of monsters a reason to take your life
And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane
The damage you caused, you cannot rectify
You've inspired new legions of monsters determined to take more life
[Outro]
The monster shattered the day
The monster shattered the day
You're giving a legion of monsters a reason!
