[Intro]
End this suffering
Rrah
[Verse 1]
You made a monster of me
Through all your wicked lies
Forever tortured by you
Abandoned at death's door
Until I said
[Chorus]
No more, don't look away
You're just a former regret of mine
And when you want, just look away
You're just a former regret of mine
Erasing now
[Verse 2]
You made a rock star of me
Gave me this wicked life
Paid to be tortured by you
A life I now abhor
And still I say
[Chorus]
No more, don't look away
You're just a former regret of mine
And when you want, just look away
You're just a former regret of mine
Erasing now
[Bridge]
Think over all of the shit in your mind
Think over and come to grip with it
Think over all of the shit in your little twisted sick mind, all said
Think over all of the shit in your mind
Think over and come to grip with it
Think over all of the shit in your little twisted sick mind
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
When you want, don't look away
You're just a former regret of mine
And when you want, just look away
You're just a former regret of mine
Erasing now
[Outro]
You made a monster of me
Until I said no more
Don't look away
You're just a former regret of mine
Erasing now
