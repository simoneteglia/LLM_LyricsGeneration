Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal
Who can't tell the difference and gets stupefied
I've been waiting my whole life for just one fuck
And all I needed was just one fuck
How could you say you don't give a fuck?
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All I wanted was just one fuck
One tiny little innocent fuck
When I feel like I'm shit out of luck
I find myself stupified, coming back again
[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you like playing around with my narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slippin', I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with my narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slippin' away
[Chorus]
See but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control but I don't let it?
I get stupified, it's all the same you say, live with it
But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control but I don't let it?
I get stupified, I get stupified
All the people in the left wing rock
All the people in the right wing rock
And all the people in the underground rock
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All the people in the high rise rock
All the people in the projects rock
And all la hente in the barrio rock
[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you like playing around with my narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slippin', I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with my narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slippin' away
[Chorus]
See but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control but I don't let it?
I get stupified, it's all the same you say, live with it
But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control but I don't let it?
I get stupified, I get stupified
And don't deny me, no baby
Now, don't deny me darlin', don't you be afraid
But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control but I don't let it?
I get stupified
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify [x4]
Look in my face, stare in my soul [x4]
Look in my face (stare in my soul) [x3]
I begin to stupify
