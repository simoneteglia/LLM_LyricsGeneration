[Verse 1]
Hard news, taken harder, don't look to me
Disappointed, we don't agree, we don't need your praise
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Never asked you to like me
We don't need your praise (we won't play your games)
Look down on me, spit in my face
You're nothing to me
Not to me
[Chorus]
Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by
No one will care what happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)
[Verse 2]
My presence won't be ignored, no not today
Don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Asking questions, predetermined answers
You won't find them here (we don't want your praise)
And I don't want you, I won't let you think
Compromise is near
'Cause it's not near
[Chorus]
Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by
No one will care what happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)
[Bridge]
I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask
You'll never know
You're left behind and I'll be exposed
[Outro]
Far away, you keep on trying
Holding me down, breaking away
Trying to distance my life
Not one in the crowd, one with the answer
One that could change your mind
But it's not true, I don't need you
Don't waste your time and don't waste mine
I'm not your friend, won't soothe your soul
And in the end, you're all dead to me
