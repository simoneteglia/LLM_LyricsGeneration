[Verse 1]
Black enchanting eyes
Cut through my heart
With no regret or sign of life
They tear apart my pride
And cold runs through my veins
I feel their stare from miles
Haunting every step
And they won't stop hunting me down
Forget the time will come
When all around me's burned
And you'll still see me there
Asking where you went to
And what person brought you here
And why you left the burning children
Cold out in the night
And calling for you all alone
[Chorus]
Dark in their hearts
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
(Holding me down)
[Verse 2]
They'll find you alone
And your desperate and villainous ways
Turning their hearts into stone
They seek more than vengeance
Look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
Look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
Lives controlled by faith (waiting for)
Tired of your parade (waiting for)
No sign of fair chance (waiting for)
Burn for the rest of time (waiting)
Hear the haunting words (They'll find you alone)
Lost children with no heart are crying (Turning their hearts into stone)
And you're the lost mother they're calling
Go now, run and hide (seek more than vengeance)
I hear them crying at night (your pain is their satisfaction)
Outside when the planets are falling (for the rest of time)
They want to feel and know you hear them (Go now, run and hide)
[Chorus]
Dark in their hearts
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
(Holding me down)
[Outro]
Go now
Run and hide
Eternal rest in time
Eternal rest in time
