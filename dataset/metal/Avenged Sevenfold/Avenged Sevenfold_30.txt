[Verse 1]
We've been through hell
Sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds
Viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear
When so inclined
Bought peace through wars
That doomed our children to die
[Pre-Chorus]
Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls
I'd make a decision if granted the privilege
But I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine
[Chorus]
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
[Verse 2]
You own the burg
We sleep in streets
You dine then waste
We forage to eat
Well, who pays the tab
When you cross the line?
Who writes the check?
Who's herding the swine?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced
How can we see the outside of the pen
When survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line
[Chorus]
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When ya know, then you'll know
Such a marvelous find
In an illusion
[Interlude]
Vlader Lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum while fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast, not one bite he could eat
Someone should cut off his head!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Dear radiation, my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul
[Chorus]
When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When ya know, then you'll know
Such a marvelous time I will find
In an illusion
[Outro]
It's an illusion
