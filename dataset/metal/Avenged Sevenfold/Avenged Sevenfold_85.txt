[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a girl I know
That comes alive when you take off her clothes
There's no telling just where she's been
Ask around but no one seems to know, yeah
[Verse 2]
Late at night when you're looking for sin
Call her up and she'll lay down the law
You can't trust her because she'll lie to your face
But that's not why you gave her a call
[Pre-Chorus]
You're waist deep inside
The lust and burning desire
[Chorus]
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, until we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Because she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know
[Verse 3]
Another thing about this girl I know
She's more comfortable down on her knees
Went to school, got a job, and then she shot into hell
All because she's born to please, yeah
[Verse 4]
Don't get her mixed up because she knows what she likes
Can tell the difference between right and wrong
She knows you're watching every one of her moves
Just more reason to string you along, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
You're waist deep inside
The lust and burning desire
[Chorus]
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, until we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Because she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know
[Bridge]
The first times hard enough
But you made it through
The second time I see the changes in you
She's got you somehow
You're needing her now, yeah
[Chorus]
We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, until we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
Because she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know
