[Verse 1]
So I arrived naked and cold
A welcome change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel, I appreciate the time, I'm not alone
(Why don't you get my lawyer on the phone?)
There were days these child eyes
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time, and I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate, and oh, I felt control
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)
[Chorus]
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
[Verse 2]
As the boy became a man
In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away
(Yeah, everybody's got a sob story)
Jesus Christ was born to die
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby
I see your angle, but we're different from our points of view
(So tell me, what's your cross to bear?)
[Chorus]
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seein' that I'm out here alone
I'm running out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guidin' me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head by the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was the only solution for them keeping the score? Just wake up
Can't you wake up?
[Interlude]
(You do know this is just a simulation, don't you?)
[Chorus]
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today
