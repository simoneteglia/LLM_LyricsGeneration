[Verse 1]
Caught up in this madness too blind to see
Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I'll taste your blood tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
You know I make you want to scream
You know I make you want to run from me baby
But know it's too late you've wasted all your time
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Relax while you're closing your eyes to me
So warm as I'm setting you free
With your arms by your side there's no struggling
Pleasure's all mine this time
[Pre-Chorus]
You know I make you want to scream
You know I make you want to run from me baby
But know it's too late you've wasted all your time
[Chorus]
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream 'til there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
Perishing
[Verse 3]
We've all had a time where we've lost control
We've all had our time to grow
I'm hoping I'm wrong but I know I'm right
I'll hunt again one night
[Pre-Chorus]
You know I make you want to scream
You know I make you want to run from me baby
But know it's too late you've wasted all your time
[Chorus]
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream 'til there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
Perishing
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we're built don't point the blame on me
[Verse 4]
Scream, scream, scream the way you would
If I ravaged your body
Scream, scream, scream the way you would
If I ravaged your mind
[Chorus]
Cherishing, those feelings pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency
Scream 'til there's silence
Scream while there's life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure unmask your desire
Perishing
