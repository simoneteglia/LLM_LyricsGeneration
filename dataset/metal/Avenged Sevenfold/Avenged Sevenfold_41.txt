[Verse 1: M Shadows]
I am the man
Six days of bullshit, a wave of my hand
And you know what I need
Put your hands together, get down on your knees
Or climb a hill and just don't talk
I never made a man didn’t trip when they walk the walk
[Pre-Chorus: Taura Stinson and Brianna Mazzola]
It's so chic, and we love
What you've done with the place
Compliments you with style and grace
[Chorus: M. Shadows, Taura Stinson, & Brianna Mazzola]
Can’t tell me that all I see ain't a gift from the fabulous one
Thought about a name that came to me, can you explain why the phone would ring?
Prayed so hard, and oh my Lord, I got a spot at the front of the lot
Can't be late for my weekly date 'cause we're gonna save someone
[Interlude: M. Shadows]
What?
What have I done?
Jesus Christ
You gotta be kidding me
[Verse 2: M. Shadows]
I am the plan
Cheap imitations by obsessive fans
But you're great and fun to watch
On the seventh day, I thought about world peace, but I decided just to take it off
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus: Taura Stinson and Brianna Mazzola]
It's so chic, and we love
What you've done with the place
Compliments you with style and grace
[Chorus: M. Shadows, Taura Stinson, & Brianna Mazzola]
Can’t tell me that all I see ain’t a gift from the fabulous one
Thought about a name that came to me, can you explain why the phone would ring?
Prayed so hard, and oh my Lord, I got a spot at the front of the lot
Can't be late for my weekly date ’cause we're gonna save someone
[Outro: M. Shadows]
Ah fuck
Give me a delete button
Delete!
Not too bad for a first try
Wen robot?
