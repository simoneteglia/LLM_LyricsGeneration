[Verse 1]
Took me years to make my motives clear
And the days have not been kind
Once a steady gaze and charming smile
Has been buried in the lines, I find
[Pre-Chorus]
I walk in the noise, quiet employs
And darkness seems to know just where I am
[Chorus]
Mother, wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me, was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
[Verse 2]
There are words that never found my lips
There are words I'd soon forget
Thought the trick was never to look back
But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip
[Pre-Chorus]
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow all the bullets bear my name
[Chorus]
Mother, wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me, was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Took the road, but should've chased the stars
And now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago, I know
[Pre-Chorus]
I struck all the matches, stuck in the ashes
Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name?
[Chorus]
Mother, wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me, was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die, ooh, die
[Outro]
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow, we all found the warmth of the gun now
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
(Took the road, but should've chased the stars)
And somehow, we all found the warmth of the gun now
(And now I've lost my own way home)
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
(Had a photo of the time we shared)
And somehow, we all found the warmth of the gun now
(But I burned it long ago)
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
(Took the road, but should've chased the stars)
And somehow, we all found the warmth of the gun now
(And now I've lost my own way home)
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
(Had a photo of the time we shared)
And somehow, we all found the warmth of the gun now
(But I burned it long ago)
Oh
