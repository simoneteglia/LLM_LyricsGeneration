[Verse 1]
From the manor a cutting whisper
Rising vapors through clocks of gold
Gilding fire unchain the demons
With undercurrents far too strong to hold
[Pre-Chorus]
The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain
[Verse 2]
Nightfall hunts us all from the shadows
Cynical beauty now lights the halls
Before the flicker there was only blackness
The end is coming and all my friends are dead
[Chorus]
The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain
Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding all the voices in my head
[Breakdown]
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
[Verse 3]
The Labyrinth hedges return to soil
Mother's weeping will go unheard
The dove that once flew here through the mazes
Had seen the darkness and chose to take its life
[Pre-Chorus]
The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain
Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding on the voices in my head
They're feeding on the voices in my head
They're feeding on the voices in my head
They're feeding on the voices in my head
