[Verse 1]
Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin hammering away
Die! With the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die! Watch the scythe usher me astray
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't go on this way
Not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong
Take aim, a loaded gun
Pull back on all who run
A coward's truth inside the wrong
[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war
[Verse 2]
Lash your tongue of bane, carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust, battle never ends
Lie! Mask the pain of a child who's forsaken
Lie! To myself, praise the new regime
[Pre-Chorus]
I left me long ago
Reasons you'll never know
No one to miss me when I'm gone
With no more words to say
No argument to stay
Another post I don't belong
[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
No home to call my own
No finding someone new
No one to break the fall
No one to see me through
No name to carry on
No promise for today
No one to hear the call
No tattered flag to raise
[Verse 3]
Walk the razor's edge, cut into the madness
Question all you trust, buy into the fear
I! See the man ripping at my soul now
I! I know the man, I know him all too well
[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothin' here for free
Lost who I wanna be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day
I'll take it all away
Another thought I can't control
[Chorus]
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
