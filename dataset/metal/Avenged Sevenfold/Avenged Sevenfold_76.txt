[Verse 1]
I've been traveling for so long
So lost till I stumbled upon
Two roads in front of me
, I had to take my time
To the right I could see a church
I took a step in that direction first
But to the left there was a watering hole
Where they were whiskey drunk
And now that's where I want to pray
[Pre-Chorus]
The fight down here goes on and on
[Chorus]
If I was perfect then this would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see
[Verse 2]
There's got to be another way to go
A way that's much more feasible
A combination of both these lives
A central path without choosing a side
I make decisions one at a time
And no I never say I'm always right
I'm confident that when I stand on my own
You'll see the truest form of a man when I'm shining through
[Pre-Chorus]
The fight down here goes on and on
[Chorus]
If I was perfect then this would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see
[Bridge: M. Shadows &
The Rev
]
Oh, I hear them now
All the religious rhyme
You're a sin, you're a sin, you're a sinner
The left isn't better
It's just more of the same
Condemning all these people for what they believe
I'll climb to the top of their mountain again
No harness up to save me this way
And the closer to the top I get
The more they take aim
But I'm not you
I may not be perfect but I've always been true
I may not be worthy in your eyes
Climb up from the bottom for the last time
The last one, the last one, the last time
[Chorus]
If I was perfect then this would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see
