[Verse 1]
Lights paint the windows in the sky
The past is sewn
In pursuit, our spirit shown
But for now, there's no one home
[Chorus]
Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
And all we are is all we've left behind
[Bridge]
My sweet Medusa, reflect the empty of our being
Snakes born of fire conjure the demon of our dream
[Verse 2]
In void, we illustrate our lives
Emerge in small
Heed the sign meant to evolve
To the end, we send the call
[Chorus]
Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Where children shiver in the cold
The sun will shine
Just a touch to heal the blind
In ourselves, we hope to find
[Chorus]
Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind
[Outro]
Alone
Alone
Alone
