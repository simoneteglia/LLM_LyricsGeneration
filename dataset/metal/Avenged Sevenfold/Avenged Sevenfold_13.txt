[Chorus]
Seize the day, or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
[Refrain]
I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
The streets we traveled on
Will undergo our same lost past
[Verse 1]
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile
Holdin' you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come, but I don't wanna leave you
[Refrain]
I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
[Chorus]
Seize the day, or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
[Verse 2]
Newborn life replacin' all of us
Changin' this fable we live in
No longer needed here, so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight
Follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?
[Refrain]
I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
[Chorus]
Seize the day, or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over (Yeah)
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
[Guitar Solo]
(Yeah)
[Bridge]
So what if I never hold you, yeah
Or kiss your lips again? Woah
So I never wanna leave you
And the memories of us to see, I beg don't leave me
[Chorus]
Seize the day, or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here
Too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
[Outro]
Silence, you lost me, no chance for one more day
Silence, you lost me, no chance for one more day
I'm stuck here alone
(Silence, you lost me, no chance for one more day)
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
(Silence, you lost me, no chance for one more day)
I'm stuck here alone
(Silence, you lost me, no chance for one more day)
Falling away from me, no chance to get back home
(Silence, you lost me, no chance for one more day)
