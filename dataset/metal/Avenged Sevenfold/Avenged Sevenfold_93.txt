[Verse 1]
Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through my skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awoke, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb
No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through
[Verse 2]
You're all gone to me (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my mother shed tears
[Verse 3]
No, this gun has stopped time in its tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold wind's embrace
[Chorus]
I'll watch you call, calling for me
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes or look away
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings
Descending entity in me
My voice has been taken from me
The more I listen, the more I have to say
[Verse 4]
You're all gone to me (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my mother shed tears
And taste the blood that she cries
And taste the blood that she cries
[Chorus]
I'll watch you call, calling for me
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes and look away
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings
Descending entity in me
[Outro]
Woah, yeah
Woah, yeah
Woah, yeah
