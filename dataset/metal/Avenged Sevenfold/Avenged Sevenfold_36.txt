[Verse 1]
House full of roses
A letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages
For anyone who cares
Collage of broken words
And stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'Cause we wish that you were here
[Verse 2]
Nothing is harder
Than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay
It's the end of all you've known
Time keeps passing by
But it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
But some too deep to feel
[Chorus]
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime
[Verse 3]
Some days you'll find me
In a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself
'Bout the things I'll never know
What's left to find
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
Can we even up the score?
[Chorus]
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel, tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime
Yeah, whoa, yeah
[Bridge]
And nothing lasts forever
For all good things it's true
I'd rather trade it all
While somehow saving you
It must have been the season
That threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall
Now I'm searching for a sign
So don't need your salvation
With promises unkind
And all the speculation
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
Well, some just can't be bothered
To stick around another day
[Chorus]
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel, tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We've all been victims of a crime
[Post-Chorus]
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime
[Outro]
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
