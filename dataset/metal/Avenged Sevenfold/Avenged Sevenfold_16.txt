[Intro]
Oh!
[Verse 1]
Hey! Can't ya see we're trippin' on the wire?
Walkin' through the candy land of our desires
Press the magic button and behold the world you crave
Where's the fun in freedom when it renders you a slave?
[Chorus]
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
[Verse 2]
Hey! It goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law, no Horus Eye
No one came to cuff ya, they just handed ya the chains
Blind followed the blind, and now the one-eyed man is king
[Chorus]
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
No form of payment, no pot of gold
Will satisfy the debt of what he's owed
Spilling from the houses
In a trance, the children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper as he lured your kids away
And led them to the river for what was their final day
No need for convincing
On his pipe, he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all
[Chorus]
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us...
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed
