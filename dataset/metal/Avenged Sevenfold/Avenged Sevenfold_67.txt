[Verse 1]
I've been away, searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas, fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies
I've stood in hell, where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols
And found the great gates of fire
[Verse 2]
Had many storms, question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The hangman's searching, for bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night, fight or flight
[Chorus]
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home
[Verse 3]
Escaped the hail of calculated mortars
Then drank the blood of a king
The desert rain has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems
[Chorus]
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home
[Verse 4]
My story ends, not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is I've been told
So I go
[Chorus]
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home
[Outro]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
