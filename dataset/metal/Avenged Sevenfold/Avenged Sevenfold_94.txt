[Verse 1]
Before you advertise
All the fame is implied
With no fortune unseen
Sell the rights
To your blight
Time-machine
[Verse 2]
While I'm dulled by excess (Dulled by excess)
And a cynic at best (Cynic at the best)
My art imitates crime
Paid for by
The allies
So invest
[Chorus 1]
Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized
There's a vintage thirst returning
But I'm sheltered by my channel-surfing
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo
[Verse 3]
A tribute to false memories
With conviction
Cheap imitation
Is it fashion or disease?
Post-ironic
Remains a mouth to feed
[Refrain]
Sell the rights
To your plight
And you'll eat
[Chorus 2]
Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized
See the vintage robot wearied
Then awakened by revision theories
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo
