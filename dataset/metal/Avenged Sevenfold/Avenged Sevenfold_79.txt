[Verse 1]
As they search for blood
All eyes descend on one
Honest man in chains
But that don't matter anyway
My judgment day
[Chorus]
My flesh will feed the demon
No trial, no case for reason
I've been chosen to pay with my life
Mad men define what mad is
Turning witches and saints to ashes
Rising masses marching to find
Heretic blood
[Verse 2]
Impose your will on me
Until fire sets me free
The flames of hell burn bright
My fate decided by their lies
Final demise
[Chorus]
My flesh will feed the demon
No trial, no case for reason
I've been chosen to pay with my life
Mad men define what mad is
Turning witches and saints to ashes
Rising masses marching to find
Heretic, heretic blood
[Bridge]
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me, like this
I've walked a fragile line
And I've fallen down
Please don't leave me
[Chorus]
My flesh will feed the demon
No trial, no case for reason
I've been chosen to pay with my life
Mad men define what mad is
Turning witches and saints to ashes
Rising masses marching to find
Heretic, heretic blood
