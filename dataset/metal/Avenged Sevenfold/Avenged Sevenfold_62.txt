[Verse 1]
This is the story of a man
Who conquered life, drink in hand
Ship unmanned
Marked by genius, channeled good
By some, a bit misunderstood
They'd been wrong many times before
[Chorus]
Sometimes our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way,
their way
Raise hell and a glass in
reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints
[Verse 2]
Never a stranger to late nights
Snake bite, fist fights, and empty pints
Unrivaled heights
He led with songs, they sang along
Created bonds that held so strong
Some were right and some were wrong
[Chorus]
Sometimes our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way,
their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints
[Bridge]
It's by the sea and at night's end
That's when the sin and swill begin
That's when he had that certain light inside his head
For every whisper, he would scream
For every draught, he'd share a drink
For every sorrow, there's a light from our St. James
On the sea, by the cliffs, he watches
He waits the night to see the day, his way
Last call will find us all
But there's a light that leads away
Our way
[Chorus]
Sometimes our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way,
their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints
