[Chorus]
It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way
[Interlude]
[Verse 1]
I've been shaped by peaks and valleys
Found a plateau where I cursed at the sky
Sometimes I feel that the rain falls for me
Bound to the flesh 'til the day that I die
[Chorus]
It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way
[Verse 2]
Days like this come as days go
And all that you love just as soon be goodbyes
What was so far for so long now behind me
Yes, I'll hold applause 'til the end of the ride
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way
It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way
