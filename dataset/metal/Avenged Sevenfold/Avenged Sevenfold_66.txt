[Verse 1]
Your hazel green tint eyes watching every move I make
And that feeling of doubt, it's erased
I'll never feel alone again with you by my side
You're the one, and in you I confide more
[Chorus]
And we have gone through good and bad times
But your unconditional love was always on my mind
You've been there from the start for me
And your love's always been true as can be
I give my heart to you
I give my heart, 'cause nothing can compare in this world to you
[Chorus]
And we have gone through good and bad times
But your unconditional love was always on my mind
You've been there from the start for me
And your love's always been true as can be
I give my heart to you
I give my heart, 'cause nothing can compare in this world to you
[Outro]
I give my heart to you
I give my heart, 'cause nothing can compare in this world to you
