[Verse 1]
As the embers rose through the Roman sky
Tell me, were you calm when they took your life?
[Chorus]
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
[Verse 2]
Shared with us the world well before your time
Though they took your voice, words forever shine, yeah
[Chorus]
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
As they spoke your fate, a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine, yeah"
[Chorus]
Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true
