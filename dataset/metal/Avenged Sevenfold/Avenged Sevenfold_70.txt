[Verse 1]
Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me through everyone that I defeat
Don't need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away
[Chorus 1]
Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone, see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, it's sorrow that feeds your lies
[Verse 2]
You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day, the fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say
[Chorus 2]
Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone, witness and see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
[Verse 3]
Run from me before I tear you down (be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (it feels so right)
I won't help you, let you rot away (despise what you say)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (we won't be there by your side)
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end
Sweet child, we'll miss you
So far away, far away
[Bridge]
I can't trust anyone, witness and see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
[Outro]
Falling away, can't buy back time
Burned it down anyway
