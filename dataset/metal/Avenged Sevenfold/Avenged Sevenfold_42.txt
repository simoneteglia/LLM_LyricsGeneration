[Verse 1]
Conceived and born was one of light
(Give me your hand)
(Blood is spilt and man will follow)
Rain and dark, the other born black night
(Infernal man)
(Punishment too great to bear)
[Pre-Chorus]
Raise your head and taste the courage (The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
[Chorus]
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brother's eyes tonight
[Verse 2]
Conceived and born was one of light
(Give me your hand)
(Blood is spilt and man will follow)
Rain and dark, the other born black night
(Infernal man)
(Punishment too great to bear)
[Pre-Chorus]
Raise your head and taste the courage (The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
[Chorus]
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brother's eyes tonight
[Verse 3]
It's cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
And from my hands, to my brother's grave
You took his side, you took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man
Crestfallen man
[Refrain]
Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go
[Verse 4]
Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit
[Outro]
Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go
