[Verse 1]
The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe
We'll fight this battle for years to come
'til we all accept that we can stand on our own
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone
Provide his family with a happy home, alone
[Chorus]
Don't take your aggression out on me
My own man is all I'm meant to be
This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?
[Post-Chorus]
Don't want to be, they never say
But don't call us the liars
[Verse 2]
We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies
They are trying to hold you down
Your life may be hard
But keep your feet on the ground
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why don't I have the finer things that others have?
The chance is there if you want it all that bad
So bad
[Chorus]
Don't take your aggression out on me
My own man is all I'm meant to be
This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?
[Verse 3]
Don't try and get me confused
'Cause I do understand
That sometimes people need help
That they may need a
Hand when this problem's going on
[Verse 4]
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't own my hand
And I don't owe you a thing
So don't think about how
Sorry you feel when now you're treated so bad
[Refrain]
This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?
[Verse 5]
And as a race we look back and we’ve come so far
While some men conquered, the others had it so hard
But in these day we just complain while there’s no one for us to fight
I guess we’re bored and that's how we keep us occupied
