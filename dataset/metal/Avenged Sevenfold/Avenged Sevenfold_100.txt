[Intro: M. Shadows]
A living nightmare
Asleep but still aware
The endless torture
The painless pleasure
[Verse: M. Shadows]
I grasp myself
Trying to regain control
I experience and learn
In another faction of my mind
So confused
But everything makes perfect sense
Can't feel the pain
Emotional pain's so much deadlier
Lost, you've just been raped (Pain!)
Your friends can't help you
Why won't they help you?
Another reality
[Refrain: M. Shadows]
This can't be happening
Why is this happening?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?
[Bridge: M. Shadows &
Valary DiBenedetto
]
Trying hard to figure out what's done
I scramble but now I run
The images in my head
All the problems that I've been fed
All the problems that I've been fed
The problems in my head
Punching slowly, my mind can't change the speed
As my victims bleed
No matter what I do or how hard I try
Can't use my abilities,
use my ability
Art of Illusion
[Outro: M. Shadows]
My razor sharp knife's edge (my razor sharp knife's edge)
Pierces my victim's body (pierces my victim's body)
But I (but I)
Cannot take their soul (cannot take their soul)
Punching through jello (punching through jello)
Stabbing, not killing (stabbing, not killing)
Disappointment (disappointment)
Discomfort (discomfort)
My razor sharp knife's edge
Pierces my victim's body
But I
Can't take their soul
Punching through jello
Stabbing not killing
Disappointment
Discomfort
