[Verse 1]
Godless, meteoric war
Anger, our existence nevermore
You awoke the giants
Who were dormant in the sky
Comets raining down from a fiery eye
[Chorus]
Mother of all
Your time is coming
One with eternity
Planets collide
Planets collide
[Verse 2]
Damage, galaxy destruct
Endless, celestial orbit corrupt
You will be forgotten
Like the others lost in time
Dead civilization left behind
[Chorus]
Mother of all
Your time is coming
One with eternity
Planets collide
Planets collide
[Verse 3]
Take me to find that much is closing in
You can't defeat them on your own
Weapons are loaded for the final stand
And they're all aimed at you from heaven
[Bridge]
Planets collide
Planets collide
Planets collide
Planets collide
[Verse 4]
You will be forgotten
Like the others lost in time
Dead civilization left behind
[Chorus]
Mother of all
Your time is coming
One with eternity
Planets collide
Planets collide
