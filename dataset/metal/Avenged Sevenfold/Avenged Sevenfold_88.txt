[Verse 1]
Dust begins to fall to the ground
(and you sit there and do nothing)
The air is cold and thin
(you're content with doing nothing)
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around
(but in my life, I wanted more)
This will never end, (this will never end)
When I'll bleed forever
[Chorus]
Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong;
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far - it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
[Verse 2]
Outside shell is strong - confident
(there is nowhere to run and hide)
But slowly eats away
(stuck alone inside your head)
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight
(guess you're better off dead)
Through my pores it seems to seep
(your mind bleeding)
When I'll bleed forever
[Chorus]
Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong;
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far - it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
[Bridge]
And you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing nothing
[Verse 3]
There's nowhere to run and hide
When you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head
Better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house
No one's around
[Chorus]
Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong;
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far - it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from
[Outro]
But in my life, I wanted more
I needed more, I taste more
