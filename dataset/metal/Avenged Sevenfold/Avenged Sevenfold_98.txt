[Verse 1]
Slit my wrists, take away the pain
Slit my throat,
there's no one to blame
Lost in the fields of confusion
Restless nights, they're not far away
Away, what
I came here for something and I'm not turning back
Strong piece of mind
but you still hold my keys
Keeping my fate deep within your threshold
Petty inconvenience but it means the world to me
[Bridge]
You hold the power
To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be
Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death
[Verse 2]
I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees forgive me please
Tore out my heart, handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion
[Bridge]
You made me this way
I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, right now
Now you turn the other way
[Outro]
You've turned away from me
The future's much too far away to see
I hope you learn the truth
Not the way things were meant to be with me and you
