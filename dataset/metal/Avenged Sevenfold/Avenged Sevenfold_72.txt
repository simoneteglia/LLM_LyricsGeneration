[Verse 1]
My story starts the day they said "she can't be found"
The news so dark, heart stopped, stood silent without a sound
It's over, she's finished, mother lies with your father and sister too
Cold-blooded, they suffered, shot down by the outlaws after you
Sorrow swallows my screams
[Chorus]
Strength of the world is on my shoulders
Strength of the world is on my side
Strength of the world the one true beholder
Ice in my veins for those who'll die
I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say
[Verse 2]
Avenge the dead killed all who crossed me in my path
Suicidal, I never planned on coming back
I want it, I need it, revenge is dripping from my teeth
Need nothing, to feel power, and bring the killers to their knees
Nothing to lose vengeance to gain (you know I'll never be the same)
So taste my breath I'm close behind you (so desperate on your final day)
Sorrow swallows my screams
[Chorus]
Strength of the world is on my shoulders
Strength of the world is on my side
Strength of the world the one true beholder
Ice in my veins for those who'll die
I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say
[Bridge]
Sitting in silence with heaven above me I prayed every night by their graves
While I search for closure I feel it no longer
I can't turn my cheek away
I stand before you; I'll sin when I have to
But now I leave your side, to avenge my family's pride
I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Strength of the world is on my shoulders
Strength of the world is on my side
Strength of the world the one true beholder
Ice in my veins for those who've died
[Outro]
So far forever now alone, a greater punishment on me has been imposed
A killer falling from the light, I'll miss my family, I'll never be alright
(That's all she wrote)
