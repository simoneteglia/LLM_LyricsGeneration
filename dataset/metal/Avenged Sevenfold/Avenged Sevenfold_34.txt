[Verse 1]
Standing in the shade of altruism, answering the call
Came a modern messiah to save us all
Somethin' far beyond the work of fiction, positronic brain
A world that's void of all the anguish and suffering, pain
[Pre-Chorus]
Better tame your convictions before you go and open the cage
[Chorus]
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find, yeah
[Verse 2]
Never held a high regard for Darwin, selection takes too long
A little kick in the pool shouldn't do us wrong
Devouring the very last invention man would ever need
But exponential growth is a frightening thing indeed
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet bohemian jury rounded up and hung in the streets
[Chorus]
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find, yeah
[Bridge]
Sometimes when I look up to the sky, I have to wonder
Are we summoning the demon, you and I?
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Have you noticed that I'm needin' it more now? More than it needs me
Got a couple of billion that seem to agree
Surfing in an artificial dimension, but we're not alone
Now the master has become just a stepping stone, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Like a blow to the ego, the bitter pills are harder to take
[Chorus]
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find, ooh
We're creating god, in search of the divine, yeah
We're creating god, committing suicide
[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
