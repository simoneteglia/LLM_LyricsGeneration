[Verse 1]
Some people live out selfish desires
Some choose to shout when they speak deafening us all
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow
[Bridge]
(
They say we've lost our minds
We've just gained control
)
[Chorus]
Search endlessly,
fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, No more decree
Somehow we still carry on
[Bridge]
(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)
[Verse 2]
Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow
[Bridge]
(
Destroy their perfect crime
Watch the power fold
)
[Chorus]
Search endlessly,
fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, No more decree
Somehow we still carry on
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Search endlessly,
fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, No more decree
Somehow we still carry on
[Outro]
Carry on
