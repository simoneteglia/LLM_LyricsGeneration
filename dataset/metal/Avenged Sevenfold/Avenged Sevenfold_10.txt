[Verse 1: M. Shadows &
The Rev
]
Shh! Quiet, you might piss somebody off!
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds
[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)
[Chorus: The Rev]
I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
[Post-Chorus: M. Shadows &
The Rev
]
So how does it feel to know that someone's kid in the heart of America has blood on their hands fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain the lifestyle that insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute
We aim high in the air towards all those pompous assholes who spend their days pointing fingers
(
Fuck you!
)
[Verse 2: M. Shadows and
The Rev
]
Shh! Quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
You'll be damned if you count me in as part of your
Generous hypocrisy, collecting enemies
[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you dug your own grave)
[Chorus: The Rev]
I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
[Post-Chorus: M. Shadows]
All the way from the east to the west, we got this high society lookin' down on their very foundation
Constantly reminding us that our actions are the cause of all their problems
Pointing their fingers in every direction
Blamin' their own nation for who wins elections
They've never contributed a fuckin' thing to the country they love to criticize
[Bridge: M. Shadows]
Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last, but I sure ain't the first
[Interlude: M. Shadows &
The Rev
]
Hey!
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Shh! Quiet, you might piss somebody off
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus: M. Shadows]
Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)
[Chorus: The Rev]
I've had enough, it's time for something real
I don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone
