[Verse 1]
Run away, I'm living with a hole inside
A piece of me that I have yet to find
Edge of reason, lines uneven
Turn me off, feel the blood so cold
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Like a product that was bought and sold
Asking me for the impossible
[Chorus]
I ain’t waiting for a miracle
I ain’t waiting for the world to change
Under my skin, lives the reason
Under my armor, I lost it all
[Verse 2]
No more faith, no savior made of our designs
Fooled me before, I tell you, not this time
Raped my body, lost my vision
Lost my mind, I had to let it go
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another day living irrational
Another day inside this dying soul
[Chorus]
I ain’t waiting for a miracle
I ain’t waiting for the world to change
Under my skin, lives the reason
Under my armor, I lost it all
[Bridge]
There's something in your eyes
A part of me that I recognize
I want to let you know
We'd be there if we could and it's alright
You taught me how to feel
It's no wonder I'd do anything
Tell me why'd you have to go
With the worst to come, lost the best I know
Time, seems like we lost it all
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Burn it all, burn it to the fucking ground
Believe the words that I don't want me around
Life revision, indecision
World collision, and heads will roll
[Pre-Chorus 3]
With nothing left except the pain to show
Mental manic driven overflow
[Chorus]
I ain’t waiting for a miracle
I ain’t waiting for the world to change
Under my skin, lives the reason
Under my armor, I lost it all
