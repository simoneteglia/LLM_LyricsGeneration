[Verse 1]
I've been thinking lots about my life and
How quick I'd wash it down the drain
Past tense the future, nothing matters now
I act on my own and I'm to blame
Living's a wicked dream, where things turn out all wrong
We're all so weak, no matter how strong, yeah
[Chorus]
I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for insanity, all a part of me
[Verse 2]
I don't like that you're calling me a liar
I don't like that you found out I'm a snake
Been sneaking around for far too long now
I don't like how fast my intentions fade
Karma has beat me down, the worst is yet to come
Many mistakes and still I'm so young, yeah
[Chorus]
I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for insanity, all a part of me
[Verse 3]
I can't count how many times
Awakened in fear, nightly
Palms sweating
Dreams of promises I've made
To no one but myself
Have been crushed daily
[Bridge 1]
Don't lend me your hand
I can't trust myself
So how can you trust me
[Verse 4]
We've all made selfish bad decisions
We've all tried dishing out the blame
Convinced ourselves of our own actions
My problem is I'll never change
Been dealt some good cards that I'll fold before it's time
Can't promise you that it's my last time, yeah
[Chorus]
I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally, demons they follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for insanity, all a part of me
[Bridge 2]
Friends won't help you now
Hope lost gone too far
Oh oh
Friends won't help you now
Hope lost gone too far
Oh oh
[Outro]
I'm scarred, yeah yeah
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah yeah
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah yeah
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah yeah
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
Demons they follow me, cause my insanity
