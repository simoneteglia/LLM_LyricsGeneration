[Verse 1]
Dead men, they celebrate
As the final chapter fades away
Cause they can't hide
We can see, their flesh is rotten
The band plays a hopeful tune
The champagne is poured as they socialize
The look in their eye
Hide in the light
[Chorus]
Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the
Dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves
[Verse 2]
Bones covered up by suits
As the visible scars, they multiply
Kiss it goodbye
Too stubborn and I'll destroy
Tick, tock, the time bomb has been recognized
Been pressurized
Nowhere to hide
Swallowing light
[Chorus]
Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the
Dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves
[Bridge]
Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
What you want is law
You crowd me with all that you stole
Oh, how the mighty fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the
Dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves
[Outro] x4
Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change
