[Verse 1]
"I'll try"
She said as she walked away
Tried not to lose you
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
I'll be here waiting, tested and secure
[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
[Chorus]
I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When
time soaked with blood
turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me
[Verse 2]
Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
[Bridge]
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near
Oh!
[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall
[Chorus]
I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When
time soaked with blood
turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me
