[Verse 1]
Dark years, brought endless rain
Out in the cold, I lost my way
But storms won't last to clear the air
For something new, the sun came out and brought you through
[Chorus]
A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day
I've been wrong times over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me, Crimson Day
[Verse 2]
Don't speak, no use for words
Lie in my arms, sleep secure
I wonder what you're dreaming of, lands rare and far
A timeless flight to reach the
stars
[Chorus]
A lifetime full of words to say
A hope that time will slow the passing day
I've been wrong times over
And I've been shamed with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow
Walk with me, Crimson Day
[Instrumental]
[Verse 3]
I've come so far to meet you here
To share this life with one I hold so dear
And I won't speak but what is true
The world outside created just for you, it's for you, for you
[Chorus]
I've been wrong times over
And I've been shamed, with no words to find
But if the sun will rise, Bring us tomorrow
Walk with me, Crimson Day
