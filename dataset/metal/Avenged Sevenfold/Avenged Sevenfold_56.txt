[Hook]
Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide
[Post-Hook]
Suicide
[Verse 1]
I just want to die, take away my life
Lay by your side
[Hook]
Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide
[Pre-Chorus]
Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone, nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time
[Chorus]
I can see just fine, with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow
[Verse 2]
Nightmare, full of pain
Nightmare, full of pain
[Bridge 1]
I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll
Take away, take away, take away, take away
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge 2]
You can't be replaced
I'm left alone with you
In spirit and the words
You wrote to me
Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me, I cared for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away
[Pre-Chorus]
Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone. Nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time
[Chorus]
I can see just fine, with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow
[Chorus]
I can see just fine, with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow
