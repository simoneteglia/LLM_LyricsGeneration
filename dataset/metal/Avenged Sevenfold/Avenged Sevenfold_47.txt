[Verse 1]
In my dreams
I awake as daylight breaks and wash my face
Put my bedroom back in its place
And tucked away
Write a note of a few things I want to say
And leave it on the fireplace
And in my dreams, another day
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
In my dreams
I stare out in the distance of the city scene
From way up here, it's so serene
There's nothing said
As I make myself more comfortable with the edge
I leap into the darkest night
Wind on my face, it satisfiеs
I never have fеlt so alive
And in my dreams, I fly away
