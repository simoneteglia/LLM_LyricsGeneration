[Intro]
He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man
[Verse 1]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me
[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn?
(All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own
(All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention
[Verse 2]
As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free
[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention
[Post-Chorus]
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
[Bridge]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right
[Hook]
I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man
[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention
[Post-Chorus]
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
[Outro]
I've known it from the start, all
These good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me, I'm
Too weird to live but much too rare to die
