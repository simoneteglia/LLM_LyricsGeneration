[Intro]
There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running away
[Verse 1]
There's a place where nothing seems to be assembled quite cohesively
It's all your mind, all your mind
Something little shouldn't feel this way
We got a million thoughts we can't convey
It's all your life, all your life!
[Chorus]
It's four in the morning, you got one more chance to die
Like beautiful stories the greatest chapters flew right by
There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running away
[Verse 2]
These things don't happen here; another fictional reality
It's all you'll find; all you'll find!
It's just as good as any other day, I'm going to teach you about mortality
No it's not right, it's not right!
[Chorus]
It's four in the morning, you got one more chance to die
Like beautiful stories the greatest chapters flew right by
There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running away
[Bridge]
In many ways I guess I'll never let you go
I'm close behind but I've got room here left to grow
Until our second chance, just enjoy the dance, and find out who we are
(These dreams will never leave you)
Let's find out what we are
(These dreams will never leave you)
Never leave you asking why
[Chorus/Outro]
It's four in the morning, you got one more chance to die
Like beautiful stories the greatest chapters flew right by
There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running
I know why you're running away
