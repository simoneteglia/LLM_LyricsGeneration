[Verse]
Fade from all that was before
We shut another door
But not a last goodbye
Fate has taken once again
A fight we'll never win
And time again, we try
Left alone, I can't wait too long, fade
Love, we loved so many times
And in so many lives
Sometimes we got it right
Pain, it found its way back in
Until we meet again
Into that good night
None too far as we chase through the stars
Beyond forever, I'll follow you
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Dancin' in the wind
As roses born again
There, you'll find me
Before the dawn of man
In castles made of sand
There, you'll find me
Writin' in the caves
As fire lights the way
There, you'll find me
Mask of royal glow
Don in pharaoh's clothes
There, you'll find me
Let it go, yeah
Rings of dust and ice
Weightless in the night
There, you'll find me
Let it go
[Interlude]
[Outro]
Dancin' in the wind
As roses born again
There, you'll find me
Before the dawn of man
In castles made of sand
There, you'll find me
Writing in the caves
As fire lights the way
There, you'll find me
Mask of royal glow
Don in pharaoh's clothes
There, you'll find me
From all that was before
We shut another door
But not a last goodbye
Taken once again
A fight we'll never win
And time again, we try
(I'm gone) We loved so many times
(I'm gone) And in so many lives
Sometimes we got it right
(I'm gone) It found its way back in
(I'm gone) Until we meet again
Into that good...
