[Verse 1]
Lived through you
Safe with how we lived our lives
With how it all turned out
(But things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout
Will make you change your mind
[Chorus 1]
Sometimes life is altered
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
[Verse 2]
When I see you, I can read it in your eyes
Fate misunderstood
(But things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for
Thinking with your heart
[Chorus 2]
Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
[Bridge]
I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be alright
I know, I know
(I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold, so black, so alone)
[Verse 3]
Living goes by fast, catch your breath
And it will pass you by
And it won't last to sulk with the memories you hold
[Chorus 2]
Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
Sometimes life is altered
Break from the hopes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right, can't turn out right
