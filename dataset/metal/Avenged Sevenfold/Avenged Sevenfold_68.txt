[Verse 1: M. Shadows]
Centuries passed and still the same
War in our blood, some things never change
Fighting for land and personal gain
Better your life, justify your pain
The end is knocking, the end is knocking
[Chorus: M. Shadows &
The Rev
]
We've all been lost for most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
[Verse 2: M. Shadows]
How many lives will we take?
How many hearts destined to break?
Nowhere to run, can't escape
Full of ourselves, tied to our fate
The end is knocking, the end is knocking, yeah
[Chorus: M. Shadows &
The Rev
]
We've all been lost for most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
[Bridge: M. Shadows]
With peace of mind so hard to find
We're dwelling on the drastic signs
Another way to numb our mind
And as you close your eyes tonight and pray for a better life
You'll see it flying helplessly away
[Chorus: M. Shadows &
The Rev
]
We've all been lost for most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
[Chorus: The Rev]
We've all been lost for most of this life
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
[Chorus: The Rev]
We've all been lost for most of this life
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain't right
Following the wrong steps, being led by pride
