[Intro]
(Out of time)
[Verse 1]
Doc, I'm dying, I'm feeling compromised (feeling compromised)
And so dehumanized (and so dehumanized)
I lost my final fight to disease, I feel that this is where it ends
I need that shot to enter my vein
My Brompton Cocktail blend
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong
I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we've got to be so strong
In a lie
[Verse 2]
I'm tired, induced euphoria (induced euphoria)
To help me move along (help me move along)
I want to meet my maker in peace, I want to feel alive again
So put that smile back on my face and mix it strong my friend
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong
I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we've got to be so strong
[Post-Chorus]
And I'll take my life tonight
'Cause I have the right to die how I want to
And leave how I arrived
So alive
[Bridge]
I believe my sins have been forgiven
And I believe my choice will save me from this life
Please don't question why
My sins have been forgotten
I believe I'll find peace in afterlife
Please don't question why
I left this way
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't feel my face
I won't struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong
I'm not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we've got to be so strong
[Post-Chorus]
And I'll take my life tonight
Cause I have the right to die how I want to
And leave how I arrived
So alive
[Outro]
Alive
