[Verse 1]
Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See, I have pity in watchin' you suffer
I know the feeling of bein' damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own
[Chorus]
Don't you see I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
That I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire
[Verse 2]
Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell ya who not to be
[Chorus]
Now you know I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Pardon your mind from the chains of the divine
Make way, the Shepherd of Fire
[Bridge]
Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me, it's never too late
[Outro]
I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
That I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
I am your wrath, I am your guilt, I am your lust
(And you know it's right)
That I am your law, that I am your scar, I am your trust
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire
