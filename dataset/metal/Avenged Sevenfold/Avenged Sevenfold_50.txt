[Intro]
Total nightmare
Total nightmare
[Verse 1]
You want to hear my side?
You need to drown to know
With all the times
It hurt me to fuck you
I built a wall with your blood to show
[Chorus]
God save us
God save us all
God hates us
God hates us all
Total nightmare
Total nightmare
[Verse 2]
Nothing to heal
No one to break
Pills had a role now there's nothing to take
Nothing to trust
No one to fake
You'll find out sooner that it's best if we just know our place
My infiltrated mind
My lacerated soul
It took me years, create me, control you
I left myself for an idea I stole
[Chorus]
God save us
God save us all
God hates us
God hates us all
Total nightmare
Total nightmare
[Bridge]
Lure, rape, kill
Love, hate, fear
[Verse 3]
You better take your time
(Lure, rape, kill)
You better take it slow
'Cause when you seek the one
(Love, hate, fear)
There's nothing left to show
[Outro]
Total nightmare
Total nightmare
Total nightmare
Total nightmare
