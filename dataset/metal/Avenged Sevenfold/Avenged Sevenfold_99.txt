[Intro]
I see you fading away from us
I'll miss you very much
Room with empty bottles, broken dreams
And pride still running high, always on your side
[Chorus]
But I wanted more for you
You can't go on this way
And now I see it all fall through
We pray for better days
Stuck alone and scared
Throw your life away
And now choking on your pride
May be the only way
[Bridge]
I don't want to leave you like this
We all tried to save you but missed
I still feel the hope on your road
Now come back to us like the days of the old
[Verse 1]
I still feel you there, trying to get on top
You'll always have my support, in my heart
People you've hurt
Friends that you've lied to
But we understand, and that's not you
Can't take the end of the road
I can see it now, for you
I'm scared, if I lose you, I'm not prepared
This time, if you die
I watch you, right before my eyes
Just trust me, and listen
You have no self control
[Bridge]
This will take your life
(Will take your life)
[Verse 2]
Overdose and then indulge until you die
Wondering, we still ask the question why
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad
And we are left the only family that you've ever had[x2]
[Chorus]
But I wanted more for you
You can't go on this way
And now I see it all fall through
We pray for better days
Stuck alone and scared
Throw your life away
And now choking on your pride
May be the only way
[Verse 3]
Help you see it through
Fight this for me and you
Reaching deep inside
Problems not just you is what we find
Our friendship makes it mine
