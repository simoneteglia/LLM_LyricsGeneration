[Verse 1]
Our day has come
It's drawn in the sky
So, don't shed a tear now
Be thankful for the time
Life wouldn't be so precious, Dear
If there never was an end
[Chorus]
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
[Verse 2]
We stand on the edge, now
We've come so far
And through all the dust, it becomes clear
You will always be my heart
There's no death, no end of time
When I'm facing it with you
[Chorus]
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us, acid rain
[Bridge]
Stand near to me
Don't look
Be brave
Over the blackened moon
I'm carrying you away
Through the planets, we fly
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus]
Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us, acid rain
[Outro]
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
