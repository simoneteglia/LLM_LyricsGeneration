[Verse 1]
I slide through the wasteland that's my world
My hunger takes your life preyed on to keep me alive yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me
[Chorus 1]
Can't you feel the poison rising
Out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you
Straight to the heart from the venomous bite
[Verse 2]
That's right, and I shed my skin tonight but my fangs are hard to hide
And you know that you're going to die yeah
Mercy's all that you need mercy's empty in me
[Chorus 1]
Can't you feel the poison rising
Out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you
Straight to the heart from the venomous bite
[Post-Chorus]
I can't regret, can't escape
Decisions made for me, no control
Fire that burns but never dies, yeah
Wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
[Verse 3]
Making my way through the night, you're still in my sight
You're running away 'cuz ya know you can't hide
My instincts are cold blooded hate, to you I'm the bearer of fate
Wrong place and now the wrong time
Now terror is all that you'll find
[Chorus 1]
Can't you feel the poison rising
Straight to the heart of the venomous bite
Can't you feel the poison rising
Out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you
Straight to the heart from the venomous bite
[Post-Chorus]
I can't regret, can't escape
Decisions made for me, no control
Fire that burns but never dies yeah
Wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
[Verse 3]
Stay inside tonight
(You're out there all alone)
Vanish from my sight
(Venomous control)
You won't make it right
(My appetite has grown)
Lost your final fight
(No love will be shown)
(Guitar Outro)
