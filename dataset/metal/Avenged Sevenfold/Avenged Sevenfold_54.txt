[Verse 1]
One snap for the dying
One click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way
You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time
Watch the clock 'til you unwind
You wanna cry about it
It's making me consider that I've lost my mind
The way I see you must be blind
So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you
[Chorus]
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
[Verse 2]
Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you cover me with manic fame
You wanna know about it?
But I'ma be fucking with you every time
Story broken, you're behind
And when you ask about it
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find
So this is the hate I've been born to
Full are the tales of the untrue
[Chorus]
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And I'm waiting
Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
And all the promises I'll find!
No hesitating
You pull the trigger, now your story's left behind
I know you wanna see me fry!
Like my soul, you won't survive
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you
[Outro]
To die unknown
Would crush the fish-lens we all see through
To kill the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true
