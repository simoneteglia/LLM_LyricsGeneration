[Verse 1]
Ride in the shadows, wandering beyond the brain
Floatin' like a feather through space and time outside a dream
Pirouette with divinity in a dance we've shared before
"Someone" dissolution, this is "I am all" as "I am none"
[Pre-Chorus]
Here, we fly so high, no I, no comin' down
Shedding weight as I'm coming undone, all that's left converging as one
I am the sun, I am the sun, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm a God, I'm awake
I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead
I'm a man without a head
[Post-Chorus]
(I'm a God, I'm awake)
I walk with death in final exhalation, and come apart through violent separation
(I'm the one in everything)
A thousand floors ascend into the ether
, a lunatic enchanted by the reaper
(I'm alive, I'm the dead)
And down below, I leave a stranger layin' lifeless as the light begins to shatter the skies
(I'm a man without a head)
And I ascend and leave behind the "used to be" and tear the fabric worn to cover my eyes
[Refrain]
And see
I see (I see)
Nobody
[Verse 2]
Breathe in the silence, ebb and flow among the waves
Blur on the spectrum, in light, come dark in equal phase
[Pre-Chorus]
All I ever was, has been, and always will be
Here I end as I started again, beyond death and borne on the wind
I am the sun, I am the sun, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm a God, I'm awake
I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead
I'm a man without a head
[Post-Chorus]
A crack in the darkness, a tear in the sky
(I'm the one in everything)
A narrow moment when we find ourselves and all we occupy
Return to the boundless, immerse in the free
(I'm a man without a head)
And letting go as you lose your name, and all you've known to be
[Refrain]
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
[Guitar Solo]
