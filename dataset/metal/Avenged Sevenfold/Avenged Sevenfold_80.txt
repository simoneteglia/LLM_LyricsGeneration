[Verse 1]
What's the matter dear
Seems the ghost is in your stall
For a thousand years
Taured lived within us all
I've come from
Somewhere beyond
[Chorus]
Lost in a world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
[Verse 2]
Here in '54
Tastes of napalm fill the sky
Axis wins the war
Seems the crop of our divide
I've slipped through
Bodies aligned
[Chorus]
Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
[Bridge]
All that's me and all that's you
All that's false and all that's true
On the sea you sailed away
Another time you'd surely stay
It's only fabric so it seems
Our intimate reality
We're living simultaneously
While parallel in possibilities
[Chorus]
Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
[Chorus]
Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
