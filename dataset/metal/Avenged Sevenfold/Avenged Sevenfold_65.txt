[Chorus]
Passion in my eyes, as I lived it everyday
But how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing left for me to do
[Verse 1]
I feel it burn inside
Burn in me like the rising sun
Lifted into the sky
Took away the only thing I loved
I know after tonight
All your power crumbles in my arms
So don't worry, I'll be fine
When my life ends, I'll leave this scar
And I felt down I need you there
Every note and every word seems so hard to take
Finally, we're destined
[Verse 2]
A smoking gun in hand
Now don't you realize what you've done?
Put a bullet in his back
Your hero since you were so young
How could you kill the man
Who brought salvation through your pain?
He must mean everything
To end it all this shameful way
[Chorus]
Passion in my eyes, as I lived it everyday
But how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing left for me to do
[Verse 3]
I started here so young
And helped you get along
Just did it for the love
And people healed through us
Don't live your life in vain
Don't take it out on me
You're cracked, so just remember
I'm not your enemy
I don't deserve to fall this way
By a man who felt betrayed
[Verse 4]
I felt so down now you're around to rescue me
Every note and every word I'm listening, yeah
Sometimes problems seem too deep to take (Too hard to take)
Sometimes I cry thinking my future looks so bleak
[Bridge]
Finally, together we were destined
I know what's best for us in the end
Someone hear me, someone stop me
Someone listen, why aren't you listening?
[Chorus]
Passion in my eyes, as I lived it everyday
But how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing left for me to do
[Outro]
In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing's left, to finish you
