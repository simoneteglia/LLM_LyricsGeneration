[Chorus]
(Ah) Freed of the world
(Ah) Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend (Oh-oh)
Light-years above (Take me higher)
Time seems to wait (Take me higher)
Promise to see you again (Higher, high)
[Verse 1]
It haunts to remember
All the memories of that day
Pre-flight demonstration
Led to desperate voices fueled by flames
Now I'm out here waitin'
Hoping you would send a sign
Came a million miles
And the Earth grows small as I lovingly leave it behind
[Chorus]
(Ah) Freed of the world
(Ah) Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend
[Verse 2]
We seem to have found it
All the hope we've been denied
There's more than we've been told
Had to find it on the other side
Now I must be dreamin'
Face against the frozen glass
But there's no return now
And the blazing worlds salute as we go flying past
[Chorus]
(Ah) Freed of the world
(Ah) Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend (Oh-oh)
Light-years above (Take me higher)
Time seems to wait (Take me higher)
Promise to see you again (Higher, high)
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
(Ah) Freed of the world
(Ah) Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend (Oh, oh)
Light-years above (Take me higher)
Time seems to wait (Take me higher)
Promise to see you again (Higher)
[Outro]
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you'll find me driftin' in the ether within the lull
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you'll find me driftin' in the ether within the lull
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you'll find me driftin' in the ether within the lull
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you'll find me driftin' in the ether within the lull
