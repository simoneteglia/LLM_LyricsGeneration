[Verse 1]
Gone, cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So, I robbed you blind
The voices in my head suggest a less-than-peaceful side
Of endless possibilities controlling nine-three-five
[Pre-Chorus]
(You can't break me) Crush the fears of yesterday
(You can't save me) Barriers - our trust will fade
[Chorus]
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die
[Verse 2]
Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
(Let 'em bleed) Make me crawl
To daddy's little girl to read the writings on the wall
While cast into the nothingness, the final curtain call
[Pre-Chorus]
(You can't break me) Crush the fears of yesterday
(You can't save me) Barriers - our trust will fade
[Chorus]
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die
[Verse 3]
Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Say goodbye to your life
Left to rot in your darkest hour
Prayers won't help you now
As long as you're mine
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
(You can't break me) Crush the fears of yesterday
(You can't save me) Barriers - our trust will fade
[Chorus]
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'll control the world
One person at a time
As I damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die
Oh!
[Outro]
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
Ready to die!
Ready to die!
Ready to die!
Not ready to die!
