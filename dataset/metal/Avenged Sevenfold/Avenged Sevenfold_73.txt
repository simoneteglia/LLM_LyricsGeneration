[Verse 1]
Man's becoming more corrupt now
Godless, wicked, and cruel
The soulless man stood silenced
Mary's words rang so true
Chastisement worse than the flood
Spread the word, it's all through
Don't kill the messenger 'cause
As if we haven't swam enough in this life of misery
[Chorus 1]
Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Feel sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
We won't be here tomorrow
Hold on to me for one last time
[Verse 2]
We've grown into the numbers
Six hundred, sixty six
War breaks, a sign of the end
Eternally expelled
Look to the sky for knowledge
The stars align tonight
Eclipse and heaven shall fall
Now I know I've seen it all in my life of misery
[Chorus 2]
Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Feel sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
Lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with his sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow
Hold on to me for one last time
[Bridge]
As the prophets shed the light
On what's to come, the crowds did gather
Your time is precious, they explained
No time to worry, messiah's coming
Don't go to sleep tonight, darling
Hold me in your arms
These will be our final days
And I can't let go
Walls are falling
Churches burning
Women ravaged
Children crying
Flesh is tearing
Some still fighting in this world of misery
[Chorus 2]
Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Feel sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
Lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with his sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow
Hold on to me for one last time
