[Verse 1]
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change
I won't see you tonight
[Chorus 1]
Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved
[Verse 2]
It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, you're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name
I won't see you tonight
[Chorus 2]
Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away
[Bridge]
Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change
I won't see you tonight
So far away
, I'm gone
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright
[Outro]
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
