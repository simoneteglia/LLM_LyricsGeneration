[Intro]
Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha-ha
The lives of some men
If walls could talk to spill the lies
We'd see the world through devils' eyes
[Interlude]
[Verse 1]
I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger
And a one-way ticket to fly
[Chorus]
When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time
[Verse 2]
Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter
Gotta fix what don't belong
[Chorus]
I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time
[Bridge]
That's just the price to play, so tell me what ya like
Got a hand on the kerosene match tonight!
Right...
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar
Got a pretty little body to grind
[Chorus]
I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all
Everybody's doin' their time
[Outro]
Time!
