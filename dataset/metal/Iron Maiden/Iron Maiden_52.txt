[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Of dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen
;
my dad, I've never seen
I was never meant to be
[Pre-Chorus]
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh, yeah, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Oh... yeah!
[Verse 2]
Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
But I know I've got to find some serious peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
[Pre-Chorus]
But now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found, ugh
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Yeah!
