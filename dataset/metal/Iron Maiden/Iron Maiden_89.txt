[Verse 1]
Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
[Pre-Chorus]
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shell shock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
[Chorus]
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
[Verse 2]
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
[Pre-Chorus]
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shell shock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn
[Chorus]
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
[Instrumental Bre]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
[Pre-Chorus]
Questions are a burden
And answers a prison for oneself
Shell shock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
[Chorus]
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
[Bridge]
But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number; I'm a name!
[Chorus]
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again, yeah
I'm back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
[Outro]
Back in the village
And I'm back in the village
And I'm back in the village
Again
