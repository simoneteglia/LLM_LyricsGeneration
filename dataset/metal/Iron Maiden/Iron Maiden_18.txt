[Intro]
Alright!
[Verse]
Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
[Chorus]
Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
[Verse]
Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
[Chorus]
Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse]
Just come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
[Chorus]
Oh Well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
[Outro]
Ow! Ow!
Yea-yeah!
