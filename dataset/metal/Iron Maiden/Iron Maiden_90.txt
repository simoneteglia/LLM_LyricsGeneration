[Intro]
Let me tell you about my life
Let me tell you about my dreams
Let me tell you about the things that happened
Always real to me
Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why
Let me tell you why
[Verse 1]
Why should these curses be laid upon me?
I won't be forgiven 'till I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt?
Paid for my sins, for the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped all inside of my head
My hopes are gone, reach for Heaven from Hell
[Chorus]
My sins are many
My guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing
Of hiding what I know
I'm able to see things
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls
Weigh heavy down on me
[Verse 2]
I know they're crying for help, reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
Reincarnation of me
Live again
[Chorus]
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell
[Solo]
[Chorus]
Someone to save me
Something to save me from my Hell
A destination away from this nightmare
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell
