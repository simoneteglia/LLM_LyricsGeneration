[Verse 1]
Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making your money
From slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives
In your schemes and your powers
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief in your head
[Chorus]
Be quick or be dead
Be quick (quick, quick, quick)
Or be dead (dead, dead, dead)
[Post-Chorus]
See... what's ruling all our lives
See... who's pulling strings
See... what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face...
Your belly will hold you in place
[Verse 2]
The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote
For what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong
As long as you're all right
So, pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
[Chorus]
Be quick or be dead
Be quick (quick, quick, quick)
Or be dead (dead, dead, dead)
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
[Outro]
Be quick or be dead!
Be quick!
