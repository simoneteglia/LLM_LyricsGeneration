[Verse]
Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way
[Pre-Chorus]
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
[Chorus]
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
[Verse]
Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way
[Pre-Chorus]
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
[Chorus]
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
