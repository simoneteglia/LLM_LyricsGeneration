[Verse 1]
Love is a razor, and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now
[Pre-Chorus]
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, and
Balancing on a ledge, and
Balancing on a ledge, and
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
[Chorus]
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
[Verse 2]
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy
At an end, it seems
The seventh lamb slain
The book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you
Someday, I may return
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn
[Pre-Chorus]
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
[Chorus]
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge
You know, you know
[Chorus]
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
The evil that men do lives on and on...
[Outro]
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do
Aw! Aw!
