[Verse 1]
Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears
[Refrain]
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
[Chorus]
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
You're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
[Verse 2]
13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands
[Refrain]
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die, heheheh
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
[Chorus]
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
You're gonna die, haha, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
[Chorus]
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, try, then just stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
You're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, die
