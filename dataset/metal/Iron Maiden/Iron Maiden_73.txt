[Verse 1]
Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields gleam in the sun
Call to arms, defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared, don't run, stand your ground
[Pre-Chorus]
They're coming in from the sea
They've come, the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
[Chorus]
Invaders pillaging
Invaders looting
[Verse 2]
Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
[Pre-Chorus]
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
[Chorus]
Invaders fighting
Invaders marauding
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings, bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh, the battle-wearyâ€‹ fight to the end
The Saxons
have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen
[Pre-Chorus]
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
[Chorus]
Invaders raping
Invaders plundering
