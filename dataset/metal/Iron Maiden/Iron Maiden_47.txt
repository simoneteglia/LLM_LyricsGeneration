[Verse 1]
Lying awake at night
I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear
'Cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualize
The horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound
A burial ground
[Verse 2]
When it comes to the time
Are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time
We'll be ready to die
[Verse 3]
God, let us go now
And finish what's to be done
Thy kingdom come
Thy shall be done... on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves
The reasons to go
Should we live and let live?
Forget or forgive?
[Verse 4]
But how can we let them
Go on this way?
The reign of terror
Corruption must end
And we know deep down
There's no other way
No trust, no reasoning
No more to say
[Chorus]
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers

[Bridge]
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid, afraid to shoot strangers
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
Afraid to shoot strangers
