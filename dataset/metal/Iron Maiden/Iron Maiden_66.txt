[Intro]
Okay!
[Verse 1]
Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go
[Chorus]
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free
[Verse 2]
I spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free
Get out of my way, hey
[Guitar Solo]
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free
Free!
Ow!
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah!
[Chorus]
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running free, yeah
Oh, I'm running free
Oh
[Outro]
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah, yeah!
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah
Running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) yeah
Ow, ow! Ow, ow!
