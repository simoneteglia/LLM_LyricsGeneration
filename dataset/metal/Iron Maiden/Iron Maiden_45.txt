[Verse 1]
How do you read a madman's mind?
Teach me the art of war
For I shall bring more than you bargained for
Give me an ultimatum
That I could not dream of
Spills of a crying nation upon my soul
[Pre-Chorus 1]
For I have not a mortal soul
That you already know
Look at my eyes
There’s no surprise
[Chorus]
Ocean is black, the Devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born
Beyond the dark, I feel the pain
It's hidden, but I can’t explain
A cross to bear, a heavy faith
My sorrow whispers, "Time again"
[Post-Chorus]
I hear you calling my name
Come to claim my life again
Pray for me I'm almost there
The pain almost too much to bear
[Verse 2]
I try to find my way back home
To feel the same again
The voice of nothing listened far too long
Little by little, eat away
I think I've lost my mind
Too late to change now what I left behind
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hear me, listen my call
I am ready to fall
Lord, hear me now
Let me go
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Ocean is black, the Devil's track
Looking beyond beneath the sea
Eye of the storm is here again
Been there before you were ever born
Beyond the dark, I feel the pain
It's hidden, but I can't explain
A cross to bear, a heavy faith
My sorrow whispers, "Time again"
