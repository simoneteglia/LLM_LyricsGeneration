[Intro]
Have you ever felt
The future is the past
But you don't know how...?
A reflected dream
Of a captured time
Is it really now?
Is it really happening?
[Verse 1]
Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
[Refrain]
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
[Verse 2]
Think I've heard your voice before
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
[Pre-Chorus 2]
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Coming to the realisation
That I can't see for sure
[Chorus]
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
Please save me from myself
[Refrain]
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
[Verse 3]
I get up, put on the light
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself
[Chorus]
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
[Bridge]
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost, a nightmare I retrace
Lost, a hell that I revisit
Lost, another time and place
Lost, a parallel existence
Lost, a nightmare I retrace
[Chorus]
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
[Solo: Janick Gers]
[Chorus]
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
I only dream in black and white
I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white
To save me from myself
[Outro]
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
The dream is true, the dream is true
