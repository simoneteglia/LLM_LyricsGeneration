[Verse 1]
You killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct, Animal supreme
By 16, you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior you took it as your right
[Chorus]
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
[Verse 2]
Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last - nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both in two -
Break you both in two
[Chorus]
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
[Outro]
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel, and it's rolling still
