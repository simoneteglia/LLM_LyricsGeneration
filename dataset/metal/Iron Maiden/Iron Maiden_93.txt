[Verse 1]
Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand
That I am the real seventh son?
Your life or death on me depends
[Pre-Chorus]
(Suffering and pain) Impending disaster
(Souls crying) The devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
(Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits)
[Chorus]
I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say, and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame unto me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment
It stays with me, knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?
[Pre-Chorus]
(Purgatory beckons) Souls lost forever
(Life after death) Or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
(Now Lucifer laughs, hell awaits)
[Chorus]
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late
[Instrumental Outro]
