[Verse 1]
Shadows may hide you but also be your grave
You're running today, maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
[Chorus]
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die
[Verse 2]
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection, still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap, but you've got to survive
[Bridge]
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone, but alive for how long?
[Chorus]
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
In gangland, where the jail birds die
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
A knife at your throat, another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blacked out jail
[Chorus]
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Dead men tell no tales
Gangland, where the jail birds die
[Outro]
Dead men
Gangland
Murder
Gangland, tell no tales
