[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:32]
[Verse 1]
Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
[Chorus]
Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
[Verse 2]
The blind men shout, "Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers"
Napalm screams of human flames
For a prime-time Belsen feast, yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat
And lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine
And feed it with our babies
[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
[Chorus]
Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
[Instrumental Break 02:45-04:22]
[Guitar Solo: Dave Murray]
[Guitar Solo: Adrian Smith]
[Verse 3]
The body bags and little rags
Of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain
To put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words
And make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions
To make a better kind of gun
[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
[Chorus]
Two minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
Two minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
[Post-Chorus]
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
[Outro]
Midnight
All night!
