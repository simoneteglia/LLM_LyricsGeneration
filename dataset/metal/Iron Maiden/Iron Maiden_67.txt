[Verse 1]
I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold, it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls layin' side by side
[Chorus]
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Vite before the killers go free
[Verse 2]
There's some people coming down the street
At last, someone heard my call
I can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everybody's shouting at me
I can't speak French, so I couldn't explain
And like a fool, I started running away
[Chorus]
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the gendarmes
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
[Bridge]
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All of France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down south to Italy
[Chorus]
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
[Verse 3]
Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't remove the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me
Well, I just start running blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows tonight
Away from the staring eyes
Any day, they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of...
[Chorus]
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm running from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the arms of the law
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
[Verse 4]
It took so long, and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died?
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
That my doctor said I've done it before
[Chorus]
Murders in the Rue Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home
