[Verse 1]
Have you heard what they said
On the news today?
Have you heard what is coming
To us all?
That the world as we know it
Will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?
[Verse 2]
He sees them in the distance
Where the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension
In the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror
See an old man now
Does it matter, they survive somehow?
[Verse 3]
They said, "There's nothing
Can be done about the situation"
They said, "There's nothing
We can do at all"
To sit and wait around
For something to occur
Did you know, did you know?
[Verse 4]
As he stares across the garden
Looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll
Ever grow again
The desperation of the situation
Getting graver
Getting ready
When the wild wind blows
[Verse 5]
Have you seen what they said
On the news today?
Have you heard what they said
About us all?
Do you know what is happening
To just every one of us?
Have you heard, have you heard?
[Verse 6]
There will be a catastrophe
The like weâ€™ve never seen
There will be something
That will light the sky
That the world as we know it
It will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?
[Verse 7]
He carries everything
Into the shelter, not a fuss
Getting ready
When the moment comes
He has enough supplies
To last them for a year or two
Good to have, because you never know
[Verse 8]
They tell us nothing
That we don't already know about
They tell us nothing
That is real at all
They only fill us
With the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?
[Verse 9]
He's nearly finished
With the preparations for the day
He's getting tired
That'll do for now
They are preparing
For the very worst to come to them
Getting ready
When the wild wind blows
[Bridge]
He sees the picture on the wall
It's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife
Roll down her face, saying grace
Remember times they had
They flash right through his mind, left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 10]
They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come
[Verse 11]
They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss, just sit and wait
[Refrain]
Can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
[Verse 12]
Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors, unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome
[Refrain]
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the TV?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
When they found them, had their
Arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying
Nearby their clothes
The day they both mistook
An earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blows...
