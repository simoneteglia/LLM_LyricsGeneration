[Verse 1]
All is not it seems to be on the outside
Sometimes, what appears to be is a show
What shows in the face is only a mirror
We all have some better places to go
[Verse 2]
We don't know just what we have ’til we've lost it
Until that time comes and know that it's gone
So hard to say things that we should have uttered long ago
Tear myself away from thoughts in my head
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
The people worshipping the sun
And all the children point up to the sky
They see the eagle as it floats on the wind
And they follow with their spirits high
[Verse 4]
Buffalo roam on the plain
We walk into the flames but dance for rain
The hallowed dead in sacred ground, the elders
And we wash away their sins for them
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the spirits of the old ones standing proud upon their race
And the testament to ancestors, that are never to retrace
Burn the flame of innocence, as they ride into the sun
Thinking now of our forefathers that are lying dead upon
Holy ground and sacred earth now
Revisit stolen youth
[Chorus 1]
Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solos]
[Chorus 1]
Lost in a lost world
Buried on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground
[Chorus 2]
Lost in a lost world
Standing on sacred ground
Lost in a lost world
Lying on sacred ground
[Outro]
Will we ever heal our old wounds
Like forever darkness worn
Fighting for their lives again
So come on now, don’t be afraid
This is where destiny lies
Just to let us breathe again
Put upon this earth to wander
And to walk, forever lost
With the ashes of our enemies
To live among our ghosts
Of our past, fear nothing
Life is but a better path to joy
Nowhere to go, nowhere to run
Our whole nation overrun
Itself existence under threat
And soon will be none of us left
Remember names of all our dead now
In enemies that fled
Reaching for our sky forever free
A sadness that is proud
As the clouds all drift away now
Until we meet again
