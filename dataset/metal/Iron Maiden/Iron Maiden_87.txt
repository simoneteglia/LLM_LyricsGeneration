[Verse 1]
You lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost, a little strange today
I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens, take it day-by-day
[Verse 2]
I thought I had it all, I had it all worked out
Just what the future held, that there would be no doubt
But then the card came up and I took another turn
But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearn
[Chorus]
Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn
[Bridge]
Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me
[Chorus]
Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn
[Bridge]
Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me
[Outro]
Don't know what I want
Or where I want to be
Feeling more confused
The more the days go by
