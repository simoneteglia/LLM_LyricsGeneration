[Verse 1]
Thinking of an age-old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
[Verse 2]
Over clouds, my mind will fly
Forever now, I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me? I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadows overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led
[Bridge]
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, well, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Please take me away
Take me away, so far away
Please take me away
Take me away, so far away
Please take me away
Take me away, so far away, hey!
[Verse 1]
Thinking of an age-old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
[Verse 2]
Over clouds, my mind will fly
Forever now, I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Or is it me? I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadows overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led
[Bridge]
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, well, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
[Chorus]
Please take me away
Take me away, so far away
Please take me away
Take me away, so far away
Please take me away
Take me away, so far away!
