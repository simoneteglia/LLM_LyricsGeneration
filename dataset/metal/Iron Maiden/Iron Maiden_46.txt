[Intro]
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Ooh, look out!
[Verse 1]
You walk through the subway
His eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges, prepared for attack
[Chorus]
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
His bloodlust defies all his needs
[Verse 2]
My innocent victims
Are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred
That burns in the night
[Chorus]
I have no one
Am bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me
Compelling to satisfy me
!
[Bridge]
I can see
What a life's meant to be
You'll never know
How I came to foresee, see, see!
[Instrumental Break 03:00-03:37]
[Guitar Solo]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
My faith in believing
Is stronger than lifelines and ties
The glimmer of metal
My moment is ready to strike
The death call arises
A scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow
Remember to walk in the light!
[Chorus]
I have found you
And now there is no place to run
Excitement, it shakes me
Oh, God, help me, what have I done?!
Ooh, yeah, I've done it again!
[Verse 4]
You walk through the subway
My eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges, prepared for attack
[Chorus]
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
My bloodlust defies all my needs
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, look out, I'm coming for you!
[Outro]
Ow-oh!
