[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
The road, it winds uphill all the way
Ride to glory on this day
Remember now to do him so proud
"In God we trust," cry it out loud
[Verse 2]
Redeem my salve of winning ways
Remember all the darkest days
Of that I know will see me tread
Walketh upon the field of the dead
[Verse 3]
The burden of blood, the breaketh of bone
The battlefield now I make it my own
The glory of the morning we make
Praying the rose is still awake
[Verse 4]
"Lord above," my spirit says
"Death is not proud, no more no less
Power of my soul will be free
Deliver us on to victory"
[Verse 5]
Wither a pain that's almost a joy
Wander there, my heart will destroy
Dreaming of days of our youth again
Strangely, no wonder memories remain
[Verse 6]
Pour thy scorn upon the realm
Pity me none at the gates of our hell
For I am but a messenger, one
Sent to do reckoning what must be done
[Verse 7]
Praying to our wretched doom
Liberty, freedom, maybe death looms
Wishing upon a fair display
Hoping our cause done faithfully
[Verse 8]
Wayward thunder over rain
Giving me time to think again
Send to their graves on this day
Silent where the battle dead lay
[Verse 9]
Vengeance is for all who lay dead
I have no fear, my body has bled
I will live on in rebirth again
Come to me now; embrace it, my friend
[Chorus 1]
Spirits cry for a god from the grave
In darkness, fortune favours the brave
[Chorus 2]
Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solos]
[Chorus 2]
Dying, a warrior Celt has no fear
Immortal, for he will live evermore
[Verse 10]
Think I am, that I'm almost there
Following now, the depths of despair
Beyond the light, darkness will fall
Coming to take the life from us all
[Outro]
Falling now where God canâ€™t explain
Bidding farewell, a lifeline again
Following those who came from hell
Came to witness the death of the Celts
