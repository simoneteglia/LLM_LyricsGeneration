[Verse 1]
When I was wandering in the desert
And was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life
Would never be the same again
I turn my face towards the barren sun
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives
Like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away
[Chorus]
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away
[Chorus]
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears
[Guitar Solo: Dave Murray]
[Chorus]
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears
[Verse 2]
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away
