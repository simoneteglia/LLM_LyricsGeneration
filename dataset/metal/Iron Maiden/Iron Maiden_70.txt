[Intro]
Put to the sword by an impish whim
Follow me now to a place we begin
Wrought with no anger, wrought with no fear
Devilish children playing here
Hidden in silence, below barren waste
Confusion hunger, am I still awake?
[Verse 1]
Have I ever told you about my time machine?
Sit you down ,I'll tell you everywhere I've been
I have lived a long life, life extraordinaire
Let me tell you about it, let me take you there
Does it really matter? It's all in the mind
Let me tell you about it, listen what you'll find
[Chorus]
I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done
[Verse 2]
I have lived a long life, I have seen the world
I could tell you stories, hair will stand on end
Stand among the steeples, stand upon the walls
I have seen a god's face, I have no disgrace
I have seen the gods cry, howling in the wind
Where do I get started? When can I begin?
[Chorus]
I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done
[Bridge 1]
Sleep with a light that is dark to my eyes
Father and sons, give me all of your lies
The brutal truth, that is never a lie
Full moon is out, as you look to the sky
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done
[Guitar Solos]
[Bridge 2]
Open your heart and I'll open your soul
Even in quieter moments, I know
[Chorus]
I am not a preacher, I am but a man
You cannot imagine what I've seen and done
[Outro]
Eerie collection, darkness is there
Wedded to danger, betrothed to despair
