[Verse 1]
In the gloom, the gathering storm abates
In the ships, gimlet eyes await
The call to arms to hammer at the gates
To blow them wide, throw evil to its fate
All summers long, the drills to build the machine
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sands to ArmageddonÂ´s reach
Overlord
, your master, not your God
The enemy coast dawning grey with scud
These wretched souls, puking, shaking fear
To take a bullet for those who sent them here
The world's alight
The cliffs erupt in flame
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains
Drowning men, no chance for a warrior's fate
A choking death, enter Hell's gates
[Pre-Chorus]
Sliding we go
Only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh, the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive
[Chorus]
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
[Verse 2]
The rising dead, faces bloated, torn
They are relieved, the living wait their turn
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name
You still go on to Hell and back again
Valhalla waits
Valkyries rise and fall
The warrior tombs lie open for us all
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil
Blood and sand, we will prevail
[Pre-Chorus]
Sliding we go
Only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh, the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive
[Chorus]
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
[Instrumental Break: 4:30-6:39]
[Chorus]
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
