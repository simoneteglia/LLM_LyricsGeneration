[Verse 1]
He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called Planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it, you would die
In the desert of Planet Dune, oh!
[Verse 2]
Without a stillsuit, you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the "mice"
That they call the "Muad'dib"
He is the Kwisatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars

[Bridge]
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see, he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgment's at hand
Don't fret, he's strong
He'll make a stand
'Gainst evil and fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end
