[Verse 1]
There's a darkening sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day (Some other day)
To live again, just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be?
Just another chance for me
[Pre-Chorus]
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No one can stop me now
Time is up; it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday, maybe; I'll wait till then
[Chorus]
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
[Verse 2]
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
[Pre-Chorus]
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
[Chorus]
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
[Guitar Solos]
[Pre-Chorus]
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all your life away
No one can stop me now
Time is up; it couldn't last
But there's more things I have to do
I'm coming back to try again
Don't tell me that this is the end
[Chorus]
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
No more lies!
