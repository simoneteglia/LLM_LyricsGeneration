[Intro]
"My son, ask for thyself
Another kingdom
For that which I leave
Is too small for thee"
[Verse 1]
Near to the east, in a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son to Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander
At the age of nineteen, he became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea in 334 BC
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
[Chorus]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men
[Verse 2]
King Darius III, defeated, fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris River, he met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon and Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia
[Chorus]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a god amongst mortal men

[Verse 3]
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the "Gordian Knot"
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a Western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain, and the glory
[Chorus]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon
