[Intro]
We are not the sons of God
We are not his chosen people now
We have crossed the path he trod
We will feel the pain of his beginning
[Verse 1]
Shadow fingers rise above
Iron fingers stab the desert sky
Oh, behold the power of man
On its tower, ready for the fall
[Verse 2]
Knocking heads together well
Raze a city, build a living Hell
Join the race to suicide
Listen for the tolling of the bell
[Refrain]
Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed
[Verse 3]
Yellow sun, its evil twin
In the black, the wings deliver him
We will split our souls within
Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven
[Refrain]
Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed
[Chorus]
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Bury your morals and bury your dead
Bury your head in the sand
E=mc squared, you can relate
How we made God with our hands
What ever would Robert have said to his God
'Bout how he made war with the sun?
E=mc squared, you can relate
How we made God with our hands
[Bridge 2]
All nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Chain letters of Satan
Uncertainty lead us all to this
All nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Cold fusion of fury
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Divide and conquer while ye may
Others preach and others fall and pray
In the bunkers where we'll die
We're the executioners, they lie
[Verse 5]
Bombers launch with no recall
Minute warning of the missile fall
Take a look at your last sky
Guessing you won't have the time to cry
[Refrain]
Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed
[Chorus]
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Holy Father, we have sinned
