[Verse 1]
She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over, wiped his kick start clean
She'd never seen the beast before
But she left there wanting more, more, more
But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back:
"I'll take you on a ride from here to eternity"
[Chorus]
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
[Verse 2]
She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sigh
But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte, they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line... from here to eternity
[Chorus]
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
[Post-Chorus]
Yes, ah, yeah, like, ah
Gentlemen, start your engines
Mr. Murray
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity
[Outro]
Hell ain't a bad place, come on
Hell is from here to eternity
"Get on your M11, get on your bike!"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
