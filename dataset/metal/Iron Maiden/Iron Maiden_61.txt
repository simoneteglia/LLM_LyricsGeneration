[Verse 1]
A war in heaven in God's rage
He put me in this burning cage
Holy fury locks me in
Imprisoned by my deadly sin
Every hour, the shadow king
Wonders what his clock will bring
I've lived and loved, and that's for sure
My fatal quest forevermore
[Chorus]
The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
[Verse 2]
Once crucified, you forgave it all
But my own life condemned to fall
Where's the glory in your name?
My twisted soul still burns in flame
Hark, you angels; hear my call
Father witness to my fall
Between the lines of sin and pain
I walk the earth now doomed again
[Chorus]
The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
[Chorus]
The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die forevermore
To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
