[Verse 1]
If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?
[Refrain]
Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side
[Verse 2]
Can I tempt you? Come with me
Be devil-may-care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?
[Refrain]
Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side
[Verse 3]
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be
Honestly... just let yourself go
[Chorus]
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong
[Refrain]
Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side
[Verse 5]
Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally... let yourself go!
[Chorus]
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time, oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds, oh
