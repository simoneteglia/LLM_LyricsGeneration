[Verse 1]
Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race
That is part of a clan
And to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean
[Pre-Chorus 1]
When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free
[Verse 2]
Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman...
[Chorus]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
[Verse 3]
It's a time wrought with fear
It's a land wrought with change
If our ancestors could hear
What is happening now
They would turn in their graves
They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has been written in chains
[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman
[Verse 4]
And I swear to defend
And we'll fight to the end
And I swear that I'll never
Be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand
And we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born free
[Pre-Chorus 4]
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want
I am the clansman
[Chorus]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
No, no, we can't let them take anymore
No, we can't let them take anymore
We're the land of the free
No, no, we can't let them take anymore
No, we can't let them take anymore
We're the land of the free
No, no, we can't let them take anymore
No, we can't let them take anymore
No, we can't let them take anymore
We're the land of the free
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
[Verse 2]
Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman
[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman
[Chorus]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman
