[Verse 1]
Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are
Dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see
Before my eyes?
[Verse 2]
I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger
Every day
I feel a strength, an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it
Anymore
[Chorus]
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born, you're dying?
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born, you're dying?
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right
In through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But, for all his power, couldn't foresee
His own demise
[Chorus]
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet
the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born, you're dying?
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born, you're dying...
[Outro]
...And be reborn again?
