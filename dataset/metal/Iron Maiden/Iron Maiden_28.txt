[Drum Intro]
[Verse 1]
It's snowing outside, the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
[Hook]
The blizzard goes on, but still, they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
[Verse 2]
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
[Hook]
Into the night, they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
[Instrumental Break 01:20-04:50]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb
[Hook]
They make their way, but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
[Verse 4]
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the Eagle's Nest
[Hook]
They dared to go where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare
