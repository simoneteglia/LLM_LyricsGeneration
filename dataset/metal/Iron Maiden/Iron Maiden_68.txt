[Verse 1]
The tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more
Till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread
And every breath you take
[Verse 2]
Determination makes you run, never stop
Got to win, got to run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile
[Chorus]
Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long-distance runner
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch
Ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile
[Chorus]
Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long-distance runner
Run on and on
Run on and on
The loneliness of the long-distance runner
