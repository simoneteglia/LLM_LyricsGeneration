[Verse 1]
Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
[Chorus]
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your leg
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
[Verse 2]
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a fiver, it's only for starters
And ten: the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
[Chorus]
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your leg
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
[Interlude]
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aww, 'cause you're making...
Ooh
Ooh yeah
Aw, 'cause you're making...

[Verse 3]
Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
[Chorus]
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your leg
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
