[Verse 1]
Maybe one day, I'll be an honest man
Up till now, I'm doing the best I can
Long roads, long days of sunrise to sunset
Sunrise to sunset
[Verse 2]
Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters; I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
[Chorus]
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
[Verse 2]
Dream on, brothers, while you can
Dream on, sisters; I hope you find the one
All of our lives, covered up quickly
By the tides of time
[Verse 3]
Sands are flowing
And the lines are in your hand
In your eyes, I see the hunger
And the desperate cry that tears the night
[Chorus]
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
[Instrumental Break 3:29-4:43]
[Chorus]
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
[Outro]
Spend your days full of emptiness
Spend your years full of loneliness
Wasting love in a desperate caress
Rolling shadows of night
