[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Mother Russia,
how are you sleeping?
Middle-winter cold winds blow
From the trees, the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow
[Verse 2]
Mother Russia,
poetry majestic
Tells the tale of a great empire
Turning round, the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 1]
Mother Russia,
dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, be proud of what you are
Now it has come, freedom at last
Turning the tides of history and your past
[Chorus 2]
Mother Russia,
dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, remember who you are
Can you release the anger, the grief?
Can you be happy? Now your people are free
