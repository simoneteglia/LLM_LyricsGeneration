[Verse 1]
Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation, waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
[Verse 2]
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end
And will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me, so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep
[Verse 3]
Even though it's reached new heights
I rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
"There's more to this, I'm on the brink"
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
[Verse 4]
It can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well, me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there, to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end? In heaven or in hell?
[Instrumental Break]
Argh! Oh!
[Bridge]
Help me, help me to find my true
Self without seeing the future
Save me, save me from torturing
Myself, even within my dreams, ow!
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me, why do we exist?
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again
