[Verse 1]
The demon in your mind
Will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages
The lies and outrages concealed
[Pre-Chorus]
Time, it waits for no man
My future, it is revealed
Time, it waits for no man
My fate is sealed
[Verse 2]
If I cancel tomorrow
The undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets
I mock your morality plays
[Pre-Chorus]
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
[Chorus]
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Bass Solo]
[Verse 3]
Mystery madman
A victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn
In an endgame, one more stalemate
[Pre-Chorus]
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us
And look through our eyes?
[Verse 4]
Walking on water
Are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin
Does it measure up to your lust?
[Pre-Chorus]
So, I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So, until the next time
Have a good sin
[Chorus]
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell, ah-ha-ha
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven, your desires...
