[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now, you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
[Pre-Chorus]
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath
[Chorus]
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
[Verse 2]
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
[Pre-Chorus]
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again
[Chorus]
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
[Solo: Adrian Smith]
[Solo: Dave Murray]
[Chorus]
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
