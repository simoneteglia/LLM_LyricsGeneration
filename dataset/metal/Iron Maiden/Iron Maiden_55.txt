[Intro]
[Verse 1]
The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh...
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry, there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old
[Outro]
Oh, baby...
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh...
