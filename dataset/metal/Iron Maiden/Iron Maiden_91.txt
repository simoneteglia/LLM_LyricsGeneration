[Verse 1]
I see the enemy, I know he can't see me
Combat red in tooth and claw
Ready now for one more score
Took a bullet in my brain
Inside, I'm the king of pain
Outside, you will fear my name
I ride a blood-red triplane
[Pre-Chorus]
Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong
[Chorus]
Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one-way train
[Verse 2]
I watch you spiral down
Dead before you hit the ground
Bullet got you in the back
Deflection shooting, beam attack
I shoot the gunner first
I kill to quench my thirst
I hunt the weakest prey
Live to fly another day
[Pre-Chorus]
Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong
[Chorus]
Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one-way train
[Instrumental Break: 2:57-4:02]
[Pre-Chorus]
Turn like the devil
Shoot straight from the sun
Climb like a monkey
Out of hell where I belong
[Chorus]
Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one-way train
[Chorus]
Death or glory, it's all the same
Death or glory, the price of fame
Death or glory, I'm in the game of
Death or glory, a one-way train
