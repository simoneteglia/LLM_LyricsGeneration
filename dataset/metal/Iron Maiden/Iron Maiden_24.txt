[Verse 1]
As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still
[Pre-Chorus]
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
[Chorus]
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I'll fly"
[Pre-Chorus]
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
[Chorus]
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
[Guitar Solo]
[Guitar Solo]
Yeah!
[Chorus]
Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly...
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Fly as high as the sun
