[Verse 1]
Was many years ago
That I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me
That all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes, things ain't what they seem
[Pre-Chorus]
No brave new world
No brave new world
No brave new world
No brave new world
[Verse 2]
Night and day, I scan horizon, sea, and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends
From home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
[Pre-Chorus]
Set me free
Set me free
Lost in this place
And leave no trace
[Chorus]
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yeah
Lost and far from home
[Verse 3]
One hundred years have gone
And men again, they came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying
Where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
[Pre-Chorus 1]
No brave new world
No brave new world
Lost in this place
And leave no trace
[Pre-Chorus 2]
What became of the men that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place, so all alone
[Chorus]
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
What became of the men that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place, so all alone
[Chorus]
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home
[Outro]
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison...
