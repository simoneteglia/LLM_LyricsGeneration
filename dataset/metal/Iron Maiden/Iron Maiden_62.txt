[Verse 1]
As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David
And you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house to smoking ruins
And the bodies at your feet
[Chorus]
You'll die as you lived:
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
[Verse 2]
The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried
At the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance
In the screams of evil men
[Chorus]
You'll die as you lived:
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
You'll die as you lived:
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
You'll die as you lived:
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
