[Verse 1]
The morals of life and the perils of death
Take the wrong way out, running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night
A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find?
[Verse 2]
See myself in
the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end, they are all mine
Laughing sorrow inside your head
Canâ€™t get out, just a feeling of dread
I know this burden's a heavy load
A dark mistake, never-ending road
[Chorus]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 3]
The blackjack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger, he counts his stash
The joker's wild like an impish child
While Madame Fortune, she waits inside
The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says, "Fire at will"
Planes overhead go search, destroy
The ones below: human decoy
[Chorus]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
I need somebody to save me
[Verse 4]
Meanwhile, we play the waiting game
The clock is struck; the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck, a four-leafed one
You hedge your bets, the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin-edged line between good and bad
And cast the luck, be happy sad
[Chorus]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
I need somebody to save me
[Bridge]
The red and the black
People don't want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away
The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden's a heavy load, there is no doubt
The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have?
The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time
[Instrumental Break: 6:34-12:31]
[Chorus]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
I need somebody to save me
