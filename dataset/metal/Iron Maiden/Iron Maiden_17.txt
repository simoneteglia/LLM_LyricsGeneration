[Movement I. 00:00-03:10]
[Instrumental intro]
[Intro]
To ride the storm
To an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm
They climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm
To a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm
And damn the rest... oblivion
[Verse 1]
Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Grey lady, giant of the skies
You hold them in your arms
The millionth chance, they laughed
To take down his majesty's craft
To India, they say, "Magic carpet, float away"
An October fateful day...
[Movement II. 03:10-06:58]
[Verse 2]
Mist is in the trees
Stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast
Waiting for command
His Majesty's airship
The R101
[Verse 3]
She's the biggest vessel built by man
A giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers
The
Titanic
fits inside
Drumroll tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury
With the beating yet to come
The fury yet to come
[Verse 4]
In the gathering gloom
The storm rising in the west
The coxswain stared
Into the plunging weatherglass
[Verse 5]
We must go now
We must take our chance with fate
We must go now
For a politician, he can't be late
[Verse 6]
The airship crew awake
For thirty hours at full stretch
But the ship is in their backbone
Every sinew, every inch
She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
Her fragile outer cover
Her Achilles would become
An Achilles yet to come
[Verse 7]
Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king and an airship creed
The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground
[Verse 8]
Said the coxswain
, "Sir, she's heavy
She'll never make this flight"
Said the captain, "Damn the cargo
We'll be on our way tonight"
Groundlings cheered in wonder
As she backed off from the mast
Baptizing them her water
From the ballast fore and aft
Now she slips into our past
[Movement III. 06:58-15:12]
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 9]
Fighting the wind as it rolls you
Feeling the diesels that push you along
Watching the channel below you
Lower and lower into the night
Lights are passing below you
Northern France asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you
"A million to one," that's what he said
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 10]
Reaper standing beside her
With his scythe cuts to the bone
Panic to make a decision
Experienced men asleep in their graves
Her cover is ripped and she's drowning
Rain is flooding into the hull
Bleeding to death and she's falling
Lifting gas is draining away
[Instrumental Break]
[Movement IV. 15:12-18:02]
[Verse 11]
"We're down, lads," came the cry
Bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent
As the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path
Ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds
Just ashes in our past, just ashes at the last
[Verse 12]
Here lie their dreams
As I stand in the sun
On the ground where they built
And the engines did run
To the moon and the stars
Now what have we done?
Oh, the dreamers may die
But the dreams live on
Dreams live on, dreams live on, on...
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Now a shadow on a hill
The angel of the east
The empire of the clouds
May rest in peace
And in a country churchyard
Laid head to the mast
Eight and forty souls
Who came to die in France
