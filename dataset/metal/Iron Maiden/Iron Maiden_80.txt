[Verse 1]
It's the same in every country when you say you're leaving
Left behind my loved ones waiting silent in the hall
Where you're going lies adventure others only dream of
Red and green light, this is real, and so you go to war
[Pre-Chorus]
For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference? All the same
[Chorus]
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war
[Verse 2]
There is no one that will save you, going down in flames
No surrender, certain death, you look it in the eye
On the shores of tyranny, you crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom with your lonely unmarked graves
[Pre-Chorus]
For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference? All the same
[Chorus]
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war
[Outro]
Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war
These colours don't run from cold bloody war
