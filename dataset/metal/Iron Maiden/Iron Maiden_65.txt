[Verse 1]
We buried our sons, we turned and fled
No growing old, the glorious dead
But we came back because one man said
"
Now on the beaches, the blood runs red
"
[Verse 2]
I faced them down, the only one
I stood alone and warned the day would come
But they were wrong; appeasers, every one
And not for the last time, we all stand alone
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I watch the sun move away
As I embrace the night
And my black dog has its day
For six long yеars, you shall not pass
Barbarians at the gates
We will ovеrcome
[Chorus]
Here I sit in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reap the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
[Post-Chorus]
The darkest hour
[Pre-Chorus 2]
To blaze in glory like a dying sun
One last burning giant
Till Jupiter moves on
Turn the ploughshares into swords
You sons of Albion, awake
Defend this sacred land
[Chorus]
Here I sit in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reap the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
[Post-Chorus]
The darkest hour
[Guitar Solos]
[Chorus]
Here I sit in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reap the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
[Chorus]
Here I sit in a serenade of glory
Naked by the throne of kings
You sowed the wind
And now you reap the whirlwind
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
[Outro]
Before the dawn, the darkest hour
