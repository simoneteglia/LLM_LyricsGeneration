[Verse 1]
Trace your way back fifty years
To the glow of Dresden,
blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah!
[Verse 2]
Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the bloodthirst
No radar lock-on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home
[Chorus]
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner

[Verse 3]
Nail that Fokker, kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more, hahaha!
[Verse 4]
Tail-end Charlie in the boiling sky
The
Enola Gay
was my last try
Now that this tail gunner's gone
No more bombers, just one big bomb, yeah, hey, ooh
[Chorus]
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tail gunner, you're a tail gunner
