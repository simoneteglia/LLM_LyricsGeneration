[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:58]
Oh-woah, yeah!
[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know
That you ain't got that long to last
Your looks and your feelings
Are just the remains of your past
[Verse 2]
You're standing in the wings there
You wait for the curtain to fall
Knowing the terror and holding
You have on us all
Now, I know that you're going to
Scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless
From your mesmerizing catcall
Ooh
[Chorus]
Keep your distance
Walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
[Instrumental Break 02:42-06:37]

[Verse 3]
I'm running and hiding
In my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind
And my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
[Outro]
You torture me back at your lair
