The scent of a woman was not mine...
Welcome home darling
Did you miss me?
Wish to dwell in dear love?
Touch my milklike skin
Feel the ocean
Lick my deepest
Hear the starry choir
Rip off this lace
That keeps me imprisoned
But beware of the enchantment
For my eroticism is your oblivion
Old love lies deep you said
Deeper shall be the wound between your legs
