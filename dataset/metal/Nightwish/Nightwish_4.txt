[Verse 1]
Baptized with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone
[Pre-Chorus]
You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give
[Chorus]
Caress the one, the
Never-Fading
rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
[Verse 2]
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach for the ones who ever dare
[Pre-Chorus]
You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give
[Chorus]
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
[Bridge]
Reachin', searchin' for something untouched
Hearing voices of the Never-Fading callin'
Callin'... Callin'
[Chorus]
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Caress the one, the Never-Fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak (daybreak)
