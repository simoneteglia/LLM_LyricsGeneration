Before you
My home was in the wind and surf
The birds and rain
,
voices of the northern lights
Then
you
came
I joined you beyond the aeons
As you blew your cave bear bone
And began to hum
Eradicate the torment of a heavy heart
Emancipate the deaf
Sing the graceful third part
Then orchestrate an air for only you to sing
Caress it deep
It`s always there to unlock the stars
To enter
Music
Fanning the flames of a mystery
Deepening the listening
Losing
Yourself to the endless symphony
Of now
Human
Singing the tale of another man
Have you ever heard
Music
It is coming, coming, coming your way
The very first song
You want to dream?
Want a tale in major scale
?
Wish to leave the hollow, to dance with
Pan
?
Can you hear the brave drum from the moors?
Follow the beat
And leave the noise behind
if we be lovers
Performance starts, come join the gathering
And you will leave with a wildflower aftertaste
Become the kind who still laughs at butterflies
Give me a home inside you until the final
Thank you and a good night
In here, I am the silence of sound
Curing the common show
For the steady song
There, I`ll greet the greedy crowd
But will never, ever sing to them
Tick-tock, time stops
Follow me into the fog
To the hilltop
Follow the call
sky-clad
Evoke the Hum
Allure the sirens
All it took was
Time and silence
