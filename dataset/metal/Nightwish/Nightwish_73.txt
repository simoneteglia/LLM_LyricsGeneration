[Part 1 – 00:00-02:38]
[Instrumental Intro – 01:03]
[Intro]
Ah!
A-ah!
Aaah!
[Verse 1]
Wish upon a star
Take a step enter the land
Walk through the air
Take my hand
Wishmaster's will-
Join him the quest for dream
A make-believe
Is all we ever need
[Verse 2]
Wish upon a star
No matter who you are
The second star to the right
Harbinger's gate
Beyond the boundaries
Blossom ballet
In the great wide somewhere
[Verse 3]
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
The master of the tale-like lore
The way to kingdom I adore
Where the warrior's heart is pure
Where the stories will come true
[Chorus]
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
The master of the tale-like lore
The way to kingdom I adore
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
The master of the tale-like lore
The way to kingdom I adore
[Part 2 – 02:38-04:26]
[Refrain]
Aa-aaaah!
Aa-aaaah!
[Whispered – Tuomas Holopainen]
(And remember me...
Because... I love her)
[Bridge]
A cub of the king betrayed by usurper
A girl in the rain swearing to her father's name
Belle the last sight for the dying gruesome
The beauties sleeping awaiting
Deep in a dream
For true love's first kiss
[Part 3 – 04:26-08:25]
[Guitar Solo]
[Flute and Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Bald Mountain Night
Devilheart endures but light
A mad aerial dance
Chernabog's
succubi
Black Cauldron born
Gurgi's heart forlorn
Pig-keeper or hero
On a quest of augury
[Verse 5]
Maleficent's fury
The spindle so luring
Dragon fight, dying night
Dooming might
Apprentice of Yen Sid
Conducting the galaxy
Dreamer on mountaintop
Spellbound masquerade
[Verse 6]
The Sailor an idol for the six-year-old in me
The Phoenix of White Agony Creek
Enchantress, A mermaid in a tale as old as time
A Dragonslayer, The Awakener
[Chorus]
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
The master of the tale-like lore
The way to kingdom I adore
[Refrain Outro]
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
Wish upon a star
Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
