[Verse 1]
Tear me to bits, enjoy the scene
Your screen name verbal vanity
Churning the words imbued in filth
Your tongue oily water under my bridge
You have the world; it's all for you
I wish you'd find the lost in you
Grateful for the pain, it proves we're alive
Can you feel it?
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't make you want the truth
It's up to you
[Chorus]
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope
[Verse 2]
Feed me to pigs in your fantasies
Your sea roars bitter elegies
Like Narcissus, who bribed the pool
A hollow voice, ruin with a roof
Stop! Life is now, still all for you
Turn from the hate, turn from the smoke
I see the parchment of your soul
The notes, the song
Join your voice
[Pre-Chorus]
I can let you have the world
It's all for you
[Chorus]
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope
[Bridge]
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is a dying love
[Pre-Chorus]
I can let you have the world
It's all for you
[Chorus]
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope
Yours is an empty hope
