We see a mother with no child
We meet a stranger poor, exiled
How`s the heart while it still beats?
Asks a no-one
Another J
ohn Doe
Sorrow hides well in your shell
A fellow man with hurt to spare
Dear one
Here I am to share the fear
An act of kindness
Without an amen
How`s the heart
Underneath the silence?
How`s the one
Drowning in the mire?
Let us sound a human paean
Come in, the fire`s warm
Burn the rope and dance some more
We met where the cliff greets the sea
Shared a story, took the leap
Rose up rooted, hid a note
You know where
You`ve been there
Now there`s one who came from me
A child of light, another tale
Dear one
Night will come but not to stay
Why?
The answer`s in the
Fair winds my love
Fly towards the calm
Fly utterly lost
Towards a beating heart
How is that heart
Underneath the silence?
How is the one
Drowning in the mire?
Let us sound a human paean
Come on in, the fire`s warm
Dull the blade and dance some more
