[Verse 1]
Soon I will be here no more
You’ll hear my tale
Through my blood
Through my people
And the eagle’s cry
The bear within will never lay to rest
[Chorus]
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
[Verse 2]
White man came
Saw the blessed land
We cared, you took
You fought, we lost
Not the war but an unfair fight
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood
[Chorus]
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land
[Bridge]
Our souls will join again the wild
Our home in peace and war and death
[Chorus]
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

Hanhepi iyuha mi ihanbla ohinni yelo
Òn sunkmanitutankapi hena, sunkawakanpi watogha hena
Oblaye t’ankapi oihankesni hena
T’at’epi kin asni kiyasni he
Akatanhanpi iwankal
Oblaye t’anka kin
Osicesni mitakuyepi òn
Makoce kin wakan
Wakan Tanka kin òn
Miwicala ohinni – Hanhepi iyuha
Kici – Anpetu iyuha kici yelo
Mi yececa hehaka kin yelo
Na ni yececa sunkmanitutankapi
Kin ka mikaga wowasaka isom
Uncinpi tu weni nitaku keyas ta k’u
Unwakupi e’cela e wiconi

Anpetu waste e wan olowan

Unwanagi pi lel e nita it’okab o’ta

Na e kte ena òn hanska ohakap
Ni itansni a’u nita ni ihanke yelo
