[Verse 1]
We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day
[Chorus]
(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever
(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever
[Verse 2]
Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee, into the blue memory
[Chorus]
(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever
(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever
Into the blue memory
[Verse 3]
A siren from the deep came to me
Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be
[Verse 4]
The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true loves
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love ‘n loss
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge 1]
Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me
Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me
[Bridge 2]
Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman’s noose
Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep
Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast
[Bridge 3]
Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I’ll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love
[Chorus 2]
(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever
(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever
[Outro] (repeat until fade)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever
