The wolves, my love, will come
Taking us home where dust once was a man
Is there life before a death?
Do we long too much and never let in?
[Chorus]
Howl
7 days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come?
7 days to the poison
And a place in heaven
Time drawing near as they come to take us
This is my church of choice
Love's strength stranded in love's sacrifice
For the rest I have to say to you
I will dream like the God
And suffer like all the dead children
[Chorus]
Howl
7 days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come?
7 days to the poison
And a place in heaven
Time drawing near as they come to take us
This is
Where heroes
And cowards
Part ways
Light the fire, feast
Chase the ghost, give in
Take the road less travelled by
Leave the city of fools
Turn every poet loose
[Chorus]
Howl
7 days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come?
7 days to the poison
And a place in heaven
Time drawing near as they come to take us
Howl
7 days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come?
7 days to the poison
And a place in heaven
Time drawing near as they come to take us
Heroes, cowards, no more
Heroes, cowards, no more
Heroes, cowards, no more
