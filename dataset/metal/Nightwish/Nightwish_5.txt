[Verse 1]
It was the night before
When all through the world
No words, no dreams
Then one day
A writer by a fire
Imagined all of
Gaia
Took a journey into a child-man's heart...
A painter on the shore
Imagined all the world
Within a snowflake on his palm
Unframed by poetry
A canvas of awe
Planet Earth falling back into the stars
[Chorus]
I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear
[Verse 2]
I am the journey
I am the destination
I am the home
The tale that reads you
A way to taste the night
The elusive high
Follow the madness
Alice you know once did
Imaginarium
, a dream emporium!
Caress the tales
And they will dream you real
A storyteller's game
Lips that intoxicate
The core of all life
Is a limitless chest of tales...
[Chorus]
I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear
[Post-Chorus]
I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
Searching heavens for another earth...
[Orchestral]
[Bridge]
Neverland, innocence, dreams of every man. A-ah-a!
Neverland, innocence, every man, Peter Pan
Neverland, innocence, dreams of every man. A-ah-a!
Neverland, innocence, every man, Peter Pan
[Chorus]
I am the voice of Never, Never Land
The innocence, the dreams of every man
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan
A silent kite against the blue, blue sky
Every chimney, every moonlit sight
I am the story that will read you real
Every memory that you hold dear
