Ten thousand tales for the curious kind
Bazaar of heavens for a hive mind
Abraham cut into three
Man found gods and began to preach
Suffering loves faythe loves suffering
Smile to elders like a good doll
Repent, accept, separate yourself
Suck
the aureate tongue
Sing the praise of your creation
Bride-prices
, thought crimes, blind minds
The Word hides vivid monsters
To bed the tribal itch
