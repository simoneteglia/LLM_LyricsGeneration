[Verse 1]
It's a long road down the river deep 'n wild
Every twist and turn a wonder-dale
It's a scary ride we'd give anything to take
Let yourself bleed
Leave a footprint on every island you see
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hey you, child of rape, the riverbed awaits
Snow white, pitch-black, your life such strife
Heavenward, deep down, I'll show you such sights
Believe it, we live as we dream/scream
[Chorus 1]
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will take your only child
He will go down he will drown drown deeper down
The
mills grind
slow in a riverbed ghost town
[Chorus 2]
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will take your only child
He will go down he will drown drown deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
If you want me, do come across
[Verse 2]
What is it you dream of, child of mine?
The magic ride, the mermaid cove?
Never met a kinder heart than yours
Let it bleed
Leave a footprint on every island you see
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I am the painted faces, the toxic kiss
Sowing of doubt,
troll beneath the bridge
Come across
Death by a thousand cuts
Believe it, we live as we dream / scream
[Chorus 1]
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will take your only child
He will go down he will drown drown deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
[Chorus 2]
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will take your only child
He will go down he will drown drown deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
If you want me, then do come across
[Bridge 1]
I am the desert-scape, the sand inside your hourglass
I am the fear and abuse, the leper children
Every eye sewn shut
[Chorus - Choir]
We will go down we will drown drown, deeper down
The river wild will be our last ride
We will go down we will drown drown, deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
[Bridge 2]
Beautifully shy as you are
Never lose your heart
And do come across
[Chorus 2]
He will go down he will drown drown deeper down
The mills grind slow in a riverbed ghost town
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down
If you want me, then do come across
