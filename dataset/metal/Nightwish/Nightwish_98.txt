The story behind the painting I drew is already told
No more tearstains on the pages of my diary
Tired but unable to give up
Since I’m responsible for the lives I saved
The play is done
(The play is done)
The curtain's down
All the tales are told
All the orchids gone
Lost in my own world
Now I care for dead gardens
My song is little worth anymore
Time to lay this weary pen aside
The play is done
(The play is done)
The curtain's down
"Where are the wolves, the underwater moon
The elvenpath, the haven of youth
Lagoons of the starlit sea?
Have I felt enough for one man’s deed
Or is it time to challenge the Ancient of Days
And let the virgin conceive?"
All the tales are told
All the orchids gone
All the tales are told
All the orchids gone
Lost in my own world
Now I care for dead gardens
