Who's there knocking at my window?
The owl and the dead boy
This night whispers my name
All the dying children
Virgin snow beneath my feet
Painting the world in white
I tread the way
To lose myself into a tale
Come hell or high water
My search will go on
Clayborn Voyage without an end
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone
Bring me back to life
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
It all starts with a lullaby
Journey homeward bound
The sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The Tower my sole guide
This is who I am
Escapist
Paradise seeker
Farewell, time to fly
Out of sight
Out of time
Away from all lies
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone
Bring me back to life
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
It all starts with a lullaby
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone
Bring me back to life
A nightingale...
In a golden cage...
