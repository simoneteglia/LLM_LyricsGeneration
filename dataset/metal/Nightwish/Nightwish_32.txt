[Verse 1]
Once upon a time a song was heard
Giving birth to a child of Earth and verse
[Pre-Chorus]
Together we slay another fright
Every
jubjub bird
, spooks of the past
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see
[Chorus]
We were here
Roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a
Walden of our own
We were here
Grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow
[Verse 2]
Hand in hand, guiding me into light
You, the fairytale guise in blue and white
[Pre-Chorus]
Together we slay another fright
Every jubjub bird, spooks of the past
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see
[Chorus]
We were here
Roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here
Grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow
[Bridge]
You are my path, my home, my star
A beautiful tale within the tale
And when the dust needs to move on
I will tuck us in on a bed of snow
Painting white, silencing the valley we built
Together we'll sleep
Devoured by life
[Chorus]
We were here
Roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here
Grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow
We were here
Roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here
Grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the music, one with alpenglow
