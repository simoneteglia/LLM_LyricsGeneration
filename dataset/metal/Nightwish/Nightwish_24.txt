My harvest
will come
A tiny valorous straw
Among the millions
Facing to the sun
I will pause before a man
Whose path has just begun
Something unsung our way comes
The
quaternary code
Gave mankind a rose
So we could see the beautiful die
The strange peace of storm
Hovers over crops
And a child's face aglow before the scythe
Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth
They have beauty beyond all poetry
But choose a silent misery
The deeper their sea, the less remains
They'll find the pretty words
And tame flocks to herd
There's that, or a carousal of dare
Join the harvest of hundred fields
Hearty and tame
All going back to one single grain
Offer light to the coming day
Inspire a child
Water the field, surrender to the earth
Arrive alive
