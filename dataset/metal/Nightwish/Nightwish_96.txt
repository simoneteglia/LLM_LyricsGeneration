I want to see where the sirens sing
Hear how the wolves howl
Sail the dead calm waters of the Pacific
Dance in the fields of coral
Be blinded by the white
Discover the deepest jungle
I want to find The Secret Path
A bird delivered into my heart
It's not the end
Not the kingdom come
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer
Call of the wild
In me forever and ever and ever forever
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
I want to love by the Blue Lagoon
Kiss under the waning moon
Straying, claiming my place in this mortal coil
Riding the dolphins
Asking the mountains
Dreaming Alaska
The Earth can have but Earth
I want to find The Secret Path
A bird delivered into my heart, so
It's not the end
Not the kingdom come
It is the journey that matters, the distant wanderer
Call of the wild
In me forever and ever and ever forever
Wanderlust
Wanderlust
Drown into my eyes and see the wanderer
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder
Drown into my eyes and see the wanderer
See the mirrors of a wolf behold the pathfinder
