[Intro]
"
I was born amidst the purple waterfalls
I was weak, yet not unblessed
Dead to the world, alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
A newborn drowning, a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future, relived my past
And witnessed the beauty of the beast
"
[Verse 1]
Where have all the feelings gone?
Why has all the laughter ceased?
[Chorus 1]
Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
[Verse 2]
How can I ever feel again?
Given the chance would I return?
[Chorus 1]
Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
[Bridge]
I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path
[Chorus 2]
Why am I loved only when I'm gone?
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
[Chorus 3]
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
[Outro]
Where have all the feelings gone?
Why is it the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you?
Now unblessed, homesick in time
Soon to be freed from care, from human pain
My tale is the most bitter truth:
Time pays us but with earth and dust, and a dark silent grave
Remember my child - without innocence the cross is only iron
Hope is only an illusion and ocean soul's - nothing but a name
The child bless thee and keep thee forever
