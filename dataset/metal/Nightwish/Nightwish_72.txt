Running for her life
The dark rain from her eyes still falls
Breathtaking butterfly
Chose a dark day to live
Save one breath for me
[Chorus]
A Loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath
Why do I miss someone
I never met, with bated breath I lay
Seawinds brought her to me
A butterfly, mere one-day miracle of life
And all the poetry in the world
Finally makes sense to me
Save one death for me
[Chorus]
A Loner longing for
(Run away, run away, run away, run away)
The cadence of her last breath
(Run away, run away, run away, run away)
Put to rest all that's not life
Drink for beauty and fill my blank page
Sometimes a dream turns into a dream
[Chorus]
A Loner longing for
(Run away, run away, run away, run away)
The cadence of her last breath
A Loner longing for
(Run away, run away, run away, run away)
The cadence of her last breath
