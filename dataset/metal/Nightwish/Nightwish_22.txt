[Verse 1]
Finally the hills are without eyes
They are tired of painting a dead man's face red
With their own blood
They used to love having so much to lose
Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins
[Chorus]
Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever listen to what we played?
Did you ever let in what the world said?
Did we get this far just to feel your hate?
Did we play to become only pawns in the game?
How blind can you be, don't you see?
You chose the long road, but we'll be waiting
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye bye, beautiful!
[Verse 2]
Jacob's ghost for the girl in white
Blindfold for the blind
Dead Siblings walking the dying earth
Noose around the choking heart
Eternity torn apart
Slow toll now the funeral bells
(I need to die to feel alive!)
[Chorus]
Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever listen to what we played?
Did you ever let in what the world said?
Did we get this far just to feel your hate?
Did we play to become only pawns in the game?
How blind can you be, don't you see?
You chose the long road, but we'll be waiting
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye bye, beautiful!
[Bridge]
It's not the tree that forsakes the flower
But the flower that forsakes the tree
Someday I'll learn to love these scars
Still fresh from the red-hot blade of your words
(How blind can you be, don't you see...
That the gambler lost all he does not have)
[Chorus]
Did you ever hear what I told you?
Did you ever read what I wrote you?
Did you ever listen to what we played?
Did you ever let in what the world said?
Did we get this far just to feel your hate?
Did we play to become only pawns in the game?
How blind can you be, don't you see?
You chose the long road, but we'll be waiting
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye bye, beautiful!
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
