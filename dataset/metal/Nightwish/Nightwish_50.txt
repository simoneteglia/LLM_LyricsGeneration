[Intro: Spoken]
The deepest solace lies in understanding
This ancient unseen stream
A shudder before the beautiful
[Verse 1]
Awake Oceanborn
Behold this force
Bring the outside in
Explore the self to epiphany
[Pre-Chorus]
The very core of life
The Soaring high of truth and light
[Chorus]
The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
[Verse 2]
Tales from the seas
Cathedral of Green
[Pre-Chorus]
The very core of life
Is soaring higher of truth and light
[Chorus]
The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
[Bridge]
The unknown
The grand show
The choir of the stars
Interstellar
Theatre play
The nebula curtain falls
Imagination
Evolution
A species from the Vale
Walks in Wonder
In search of
The source of the tale
[Chorus]
The music of this awe
Deep silence and the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
The music of this awe
Deep silence between the notes
Deafens me with endless love
This vagrant island Earth
A pilgrim shining bright
We are shuddering
Before the beautiful
Before the plentiful
We, the voyagers
