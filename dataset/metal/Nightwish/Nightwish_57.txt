A grand oasis
in the vastness of gloom
Child
of
dew-spangled cobweb
Mother to the moon
Constellations beholders of
the 3rd vagrant
Theater for the play of life
Tragedienne of heavens
Watching the eyes of the night
Sailing the virgin oceans
A planetride for the Mother and Child
Floating upon the quiet hydrogen lakes
In this ambrosial merry-go-round they will gaze
Ephemereal life touched by a billion-year show
Separating the poet from the woe
Tragedienne of heavens
Watching the eyes of the night
Sailing the virgin oceans
A planetride for the Mother and Child
Oracle of the Delphian Domine
Witness of Adam's frailty
Seer of the master prophecy
The stellar world her betrothed
Wanderers in cosmic caravan
Universal bond - The Starborn
A son in the search for the truth
Following the pages of Almagest
Discovering the origin of dreams
Stargazers ride through the ancient realms
Tragedienne of heavens
Watching the eyes of the night
Sailing the virgin oceans
A planetride for the Mother and Child
