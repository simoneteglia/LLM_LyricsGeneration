An angelface smiles to me
Under a headline of tragedy
That smile used to give me warmth
Farewell, no words to say
Beside the cross on your grave
And those forever burning candles
Needed elsewhere
To remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh Lord why
The angels fall first?
Not relieved by thoughts of Shangri-La
Nor enlightened by the lessons of Christ
I'll never understand the meaning of the right
Ignorance lead me into the light
Needed elsewhere
To remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh Lord why
The angels fall first?
Sing me a song
Of your beauty
Of your kingdom
Let the melodies of your harps
Caress those whom we still need
Yesterday we shook hands
My friend
Today a moonbeam lightens my path
My guardian
