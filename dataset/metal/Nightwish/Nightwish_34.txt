[Intro]
Once I had a dream
And this is it
[Verse 1]
(Once there was a child's dream)
One night the clock struck twelve
The window open wide
(Once there was a child's heart)
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside
[Verse 2]
(Once I knew all the tales)
It's time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
(Once I wished for this night)
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and
[Chorus]
Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago
[Bridge]
The one in the Big Blue is what the world stole from me
This night will bring him back to me
[Chorus]
Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago
Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago
