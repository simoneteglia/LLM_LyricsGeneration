Take heed, dear heart
Once apart, she can touch
Nor me nor you
Dressed as one
A wolf will betray a lamb
Lead astray the gazers
The razors on your seducing skin
In the meadow of sinful thoughts
Every flower's a perfect one
To paradise with pleasure, haunted
Haunted by fear
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
I am the Fallen
You are what my sins enclose
Lust is not as creative
As its discovery
To paradise with pleasure, haunted
Haunted by fear
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
Bless me, undress me
Pick your prey in a wicked way
God I must confess...
...I do envy the sinners
A sin for him
Desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
A burning veil
For the bride too dear for him
A sin for him
Desire within, desire within
Fall in love with your deep dark sin
