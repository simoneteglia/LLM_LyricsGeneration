[Intro]
Ring-a-ring-a-roses
A pocket full of posies
Atishoo, atishoo
We all fall down
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in a
daymare
Dying to meet you, little child
Enter enter this sideshow
Time for bed the cradle still rocks
13 chimes on a dead man's clock
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
[Verse 2]
The bride will lure you, cook you, eat you
Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear
Burning farms and squealing pigs
A pool of snakes to swim with, oh sweet poison
Bite me, bite me
[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Be heartlessly welcome!
To Cirque De Morgue!
And what a show we have for you tonight!
[Verse 3]
Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes
Mindless ghouls with lot of limbs to lose
Illusionists, contortionists
Tightrope walkers tightening the noose
[Verse 4]
Horde of spiders, closet tentacles
Laughing harpies with their talons ripping
Sher-chrisss, per-vizzz
The pendulum still sways for you
Such are the darks here to show you, child in a corner
Fallen mirrors, all kingdom in cinders
