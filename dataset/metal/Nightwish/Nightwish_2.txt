Crave the machine
Revere the screen
Zoom in for flak and misery
Bleed some pixels
Shoot yourself
Pose for the dead
Have a near-life experience
In a hot air
matrix
Now you're a star
Vain avatar
Feeding the beast
In your loud Egoland
You have become
Tool of a tool
Digital ghouls
Telling you to
Shut up and dance!
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather
Noise
From a sunless world
Your mirror is black
, only a copy stares back
At a slave of
brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise
Please love me
See how I bleed
Please endure
I have such empathy in me
Hum, noise, hum
Beautifully numb
Tapping the quiet air
To have a meaning
By a carrion
Sad hologram
Lost in the maze
The real and human feel
Sunset is free
From this deity
The Earth has a real voice
Go out and get in
I will follow
Color a yarn and the crowds will gather
Feast your eyes on the black mirror
Feed the beast, join the gathering
Tell a tale
Feast of fears is drawing nearer
Beyond the human horizon
Something terrifying sleeps
