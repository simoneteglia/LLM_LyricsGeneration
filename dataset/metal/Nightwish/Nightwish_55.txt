[Verse 1]
Who the hell are you to tell me?
What to do, why to do, why bother?
Leech in a mask of virtue
Such waste, to ever think of you again
Hey Judas, your Christess was our love
Hit and run, your will be done
Never sorry, never wrong
More, more, more, more, more!
[Chorus]
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
Let me explain one thing
All for her and more for me
Why is it so hard to see?
I see no sense in doing this
Not enough for me
I fuck up everything but let me explain
Some day
Some day you shall flee
Panting and weak
[Chorus]
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
Master passion greed
All within me gone but pain and hope
Hoping that the pain would fade away
[Breakdown]
Greed, your master passion
I feed the mouth that bites me
Mammon, opiate of the masses
The reek of your lies draws flies
Seek her, seduce her, tame her
Blame her, have her, kill her
Seek her, seduce her, tame her
Blame her, feast on it all
Seek her, seduce her, tame her
Blame her, have her, kill her
Seek her, seduce her, tame her
Blame her, feast on it all!
[Outro]
With awakening the tears will begin
To my everlasting shame silence took me
