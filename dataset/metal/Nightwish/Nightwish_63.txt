[Verse 1]
I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed
You bathed in my wine
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds
[Chorus]
Put a stake through my heart!
And drag me into sunlight
So awake for your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer
[Verse 2]
Swansong for the Wish of Night
God it hurts, give a name to the pain
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed
[Chorus]
Put a stake through my heart!
And drag me into sunlight
So awake for your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer
[Verse 3]
Blame me, it's me
Coward, a good-for-nothing scapegoat
Dumb kid, living a dream
Romantic only on paper
[Verse 4]
Tell me why you took all that was mine!
Stay as you lay - don't lead me astray!
Tell me why you took all that was mine!
Stay as you lay - don't lead me astray!
[Bridge 1]
Wake up, mow the weed
You'd be nothing without me
Take my life if you have the heart to die
[Bridge 2]
You bastards tainted my tool
Raped my words, played me fool
Gather your precious glitter and leave me be
The Great Ones are all dead
And I'm tired, too
I truly hate you all!
