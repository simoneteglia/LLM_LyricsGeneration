[Verse 1]
A ballad of a dark queen echoes through night
As he flees the curse of gods, the pharaoh's wrath
[Chorus]
1001 nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen
[Verse 2]
Ancient mariner in a sea of sand
The burning beauty his tomb to die for
[Chorus]
1001 nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen
(Horizon's swarming with death)
(Run!)
[Birdge]
Heaven has a darkened face
Dunes are soaring, as on a chase
Caravan of the cursed
Chasing him across the waves
May he now rest under aegis of mirage
As the sands slowly turn to Elysian fields?
[Chorus]
1001 nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen
(1001)
1001 nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen
(1001)
[Outro]
(1001)
(1001)
