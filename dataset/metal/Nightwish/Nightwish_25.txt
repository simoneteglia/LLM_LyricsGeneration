A cradle Earth, horizons unseen
New world in thirst, for the arcane
We are, singers of the gone
We remember, as along came life
A cradle Earth, horizons unseen
Birth of one, and a zillion sideshows
We are, we were, and will not be
We remember, as along came acorn
Another birth, another moss green
New world in thirst, for the unseen
An empty zoo, a starlight vigil
Will have a visit,
as along came heartbeat
Another birth, another monster
Endless forms
,
towards the stronger
Menagerie, of a new world order
We held our breath, as along came suffering
We remember, father
Pikaia
Gave the way, as along came Sapien
The cradle Earth, welcoming its newborn
Aeons since that very first acorn
Together now, in this timeless parade
The living lie, dead afraid
Then they saw the moon, and found caring
We remember, as along came writing
Such worlds were there, zoos dead again
After all, we should`ve never appeared
Spaceship Earth
, through the fields of time
They understood, as along came wisdom
We have been here a while
At the end of Pi
, as along came harvest
We will remember all the suffering
We wrote this in a tongue you will understand
Words and melodies with a touch of coloring
We were there and will remember mankind
Our kin
Aeons ago
