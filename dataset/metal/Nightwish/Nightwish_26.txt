[Intro]
Ever felt away with me?
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me?
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me?
[Verse 1]
Would you do it with me?
Heal the scars and change the stars
Would you do it for me?
Turn loose the heaven within
I'd take you away
Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek
My song can but borrow your grace
[Chorus: Tarja &
Marco
]
Ever felt away with me?
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me?
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me?
(Dream of me)
[Verse 2]
Come out, come out wherever you are
So lost in your sea
Give in, give in for my touch
For my taste, for my lust
[Chorus]
Ever felt away with me?
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me?
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me?
[Bridge: Tarja &
Marco
]
Your beauty cascaded on me
In this white night fantasy
(Dream of me)
[Chorus]
Ever felt away with me?
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me?
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me?
[Chorus: Tarja &
Marco
]
Ever felt away with me?
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me?
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me?
(Dream of me)
[Chorus]
Ever felt away with me?
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me?
My love, it lies so deep
Ever dream of me?
