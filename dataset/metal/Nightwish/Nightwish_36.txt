[Verse 1]
Come on, hop on, let's take a ride
Come and meet the travelers who came to town
They have a tale from the past to tell
From the great dark between the stars
[Bridge 1]
We are a special speck of dust
A fleeting moment on an ark
A celebration, a resthaven
Of life
[Pre-Chorus]
Lay on a field of green
With Mother Eve
With Father Pine reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous
[Chorus]
Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful
[Verse 2]
Beyond aeons we take a ride
Welcoming the shrew that survived
To see the Tiktaalik take her first walk
Witness the birth of flight
[Bridge 2]
Deeper down in Panthalassa
A eukaryote finds her way
We return to the very first one
Greet the one we'll soon become
[Pre-Chorus]
Lay on a field of green
With Mother Eve
With Father Pine reaching high
Look at yourself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous
[Chorus]
Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Deep into the past
Follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
Alive, aware, in awe
Before the grandeur of it all
Our floating pale blue ark
Of endless forms most beautiful
