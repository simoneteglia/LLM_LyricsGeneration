[Verse 1]
Fare thee well, little broken heart
Downcast eyes, lifetime loneliness
[Refrain]
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone
[Verse 2]
Constant longing for the perfect soul
Unwashed scenery forever gone
[Refrain]
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone
[Chorus]
No love left in me
No eyes to see the heaven beside me
My time is yet to come
So I'll be forever yours
[Refrain]
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone
[Chorus]
No love left in me
No eyes to see the heaven beside me
My time is yet to come
So I'll be forever yours
No love left in me
No eyes to see the heaven beside me
My time is yet to come
So I'll be forever yours
[Refrain]
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone
Whatever walks in my heart
