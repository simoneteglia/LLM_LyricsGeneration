I close my eyes
The lantern dies
The scent of awakening
Wild honey and dew
Childhood games
Woods and lakes
Streams of silver
Toys of olden days
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
The flowers of wonder
And the hidden treasures
In the meadow of life
My acre of heaven
A 5-year-old winterheart
In a place called home
Sailing the waves of past
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
Rocking chair without a dreamer
A wooden swing without laughter
Sandbox without toy soldiers
Yuletide without the flight
Dream bound for life
Flowers wither, treasures stay hidden
Until I see the first star of fall
I fall asleep
And see it all
Mother's care
And color of the kites
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
Meadows of heaven
