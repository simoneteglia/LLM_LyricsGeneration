[Intro]
Sain y niwl
Gaunt y goydwig fwsog
Gwenithfaen, cen y coed, a'r lleuad
Un gway f'adenydd i dapestri bywyd
[Verse 1]
Light shines bright beyond all the cities of gold
On a road of birdsong and chocolate shops
Of buskers, jugglers, innkeeper's welcoming call
The sound of mist, smell of moss-grown woods
[Chorus]
Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher
Into the wild
Weaving my world into tapestry of life
Its fire golden
In my Walden
[Verse 2]
I will taste the
manna
in every tree
Liquid honey
and wine from the distant hills
An early morning greenwood concerto
Greets my Walden with its eternal voice
[Chorus]
Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher
Into the wild
Weaving my world into tapestry of life
Its fire golden
In my Walden
Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher
Into the wild
Weaving my world into tapestry of life
Its fire golden
In my Walden
Weaving my wings from many-colored yarns
Flying higher, higher, higher...
[Bridge]
I do not wish to evade the world
Yet I will forever build my own
Forever my own
Forever my home
