[Verse 1: Tarja Turunen]
In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find
[Chorus: Tarja Turunen]
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
[Verse 2: Marco Hietala]
Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
[Chorus: Marco Hietala]
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
[Verse 3: Tarja Turunen,
Marco Hietala
,
Both
]
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
Your
/My
spirit and
your
/my
voice
In one combined
[Chorus: Tarja Turunen,
Marco Hietala
,
Both
]
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside
my/
your
mind
[Bridge: Tarja Turunen]
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera
[Verse 4: Tarja Turunen,
Marco Hietala
,
Both
]
In all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery
, were both in you
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind
[Chorus: Tarja Turunen,
Marco Hietala
,
Both
]
The Phantom of the Opera is
here/
there
Inside
my/
your
mind
[Outro: Tarja Turunen &
Marco Hietala
]
Sing, my Angel of Music!
He's there the Phantom of the Opera
Sing for me
Sing my angel, sing
Sing for me
