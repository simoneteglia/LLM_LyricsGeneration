[Verse 1]
We seduce the dark with pain and rapture
Like two ships that pass in the night
You and I, a whore and a bashful sailor
Welcome to
a sunrise of a dirty mind
[Chorus]
All you love is a lie, you one-night butterfly
Hurt me, be the one. whoever brings the night
[Verse 2]
The dark, created to hide the innocent white, the lust of night
Eyes so bright, seductive lies
Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part
Poisoned dart of desire
[Chorus]
All you love is a lie, you one-night butterfly
Hurt me, be the one. whoever brings the night
[Bridge]
Choose a bride tonight, a fantasy for a zombie
Hurt me, I love to suffer, your harem's a dream for free
(Enter, suck from us and live forever
Rotten beauty will haunt you for a lifetime)
Come with me underwater, and drown to despise me no more
Unholy, unworthy, my night is a dream for free
[Chorus]
All you love is a lie, you one-night butterfly
Hurt me, be the one. whoever brings the night
All you love is a lie, you one-night butterfly
Hurt me, be the one. whoever brings the night
(Whoever brings the night...)
