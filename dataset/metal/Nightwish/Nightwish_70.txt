Heaven today is but a way
To a place I once called home
Heart of a child, one final sigh
As another love goes cold
Once my heart beat to the rhythm of the falling snow
Blackened below, the river now flows
A stream of molten virgin snow
[Chorus]
For the heart I'll never have
For the child forever gone
The music flows, because it longs
For the heart I once had
Living today without a way
To understand the weight of the world
Faded and torn, old and forlorn
My weak and hoping heart
For the child, for the light
For the heart I once had
I will believe and foresee
Everything I could ever be
[Chorus]
Time will not heal a Dead Boy's scars
Time will kill
[Chorus]
