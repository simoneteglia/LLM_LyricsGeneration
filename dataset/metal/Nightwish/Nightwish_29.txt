[Intro: Anette Olzon & Marco Hietala]
I want my tears back
[Verse 1: Anette Olzon]
The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter grey
Wildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat
A railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love
Blue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings
[Pre-Chorus: Anette Olzon]
Where is the wonder where's the awe?
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door?
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there?
Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare?
[Chorus: Marco Hietala]
Where is the wonder, where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me
[Post-Chorus: Anette Olzon & Marco Hietala]
I want my tears back
I want my tears back, now
[Verse 2: Anette Olzon]
A ballet on a grove, still growing young all alone
A rag doll, a best friend,
the voice of Mary Costa
[Pre-Chorus: Anette Olzon]
Where is the wonder where's the awe?
Where's dear Alice knocking on the door?
Where's the trapdoor that takes me there?
Where the real is shattered by a Mad March Hare?
[Chorus: Marco Hietala]
Where is the wonder, where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me
[Chorus: Anette Olzon & Marco Hietala]
Where is the wonder, where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me
[Post-Chorus: Anette Olzon & Marco Hietala]
I want my tears back
I want my tears back now
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus: Marco Hietala]
Where is the wonder, where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me
[Chorus: Anette Olzon & Marco Hietala]
Where is the wonder, where's the awe?
Where are the sleepless nights I used to live for?
Before the years take me
I wish to see the lost in me
[Outro: Anette Olzon & Marco Hietala]
I want my tears back
I want my tears back now
