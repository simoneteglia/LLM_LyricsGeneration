[Part 1: White Lands Of Empathica – 00:00-01:19]
[Reverse Whispered Spoken Intro – Tom Williams]
"Niaga dna niaga
I wonk I lliw eid enola
Ees ot hguone gnol
Gnol hguone ot raeh eht sdnuos fo snug
Gnitnuoc dna setunim eerht evah ylno I won
Rof degnol syawla I htaed a em evig"
[Verse 1]
The end
The songwriter's dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of empathica
Of innocence
Empathica
Innocence
[Part 2: Home – 01:19-04:17]
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2 – Anette Olzon]
The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of Hell
One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home
[Chorus – Anette]
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
[Verse 3 – Anette]
My home was there and then, those
meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face
Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right
Take me home
[Chorus – Anette]
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
And one for God
Save me
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world, a whore for the cold world, a whore for the cold world
[Part 3: The Pacific – 04:17-07:02]
[Orchestral Section]
[Verse 4]
Sparkle my scenery
With Turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The ever free
Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the Pain
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby
[Verse 5 – Anette]
On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all
[Spoken by Child – Tom Williams]
"I'm afraid, I'm so afraid
Being raped, again and again, and again
I know I will die alone
But loved
You live long enough to hear the sounds of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
For years I've been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me
A death I always longed for."
[Part 4: Dark Passion Play – 07:02-10:00]
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 6 – Marco Hietala]
2nd robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet
[Verse 7 – Marco]
Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell
[Verse 8 – Anette & Marco]
Next morning dawned upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came
[Chorus]
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
And one for God
Save me
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world, a whore for the cold world, whore for the cold world
[Spoken by Child – Guy Elliott]
"Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005
Tuomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence
He was found naked and dead
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text."
[Interlude]
Save me
[Part 5: Mother And Father – 10:00-13:55]
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Refrain]
Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love
Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end, I will always love you
[Spoken]
The beginning
[Instrumental and Vocalizations Outro]
