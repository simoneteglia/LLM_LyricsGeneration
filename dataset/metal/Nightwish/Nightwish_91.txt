Close your eyes
Feel the ocean where passion lies
Silently the senses
Abandon all defences
A place between sleep and awake
End of innocence, unending masquerade
That's where I'll wait for you
Hold me near you
So close I sear you
Seeing, believing
Dreaming, decieving
A place between sleep and awake
End of innocence, unending masquerade
That's where I'll wait for you
Sleepwalker seducing me
I dare to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you're mine to keep
Sleepwalker
Sleepwalker
(Sleepwalk with me...)
Sleepwalker seducing me
I dare to enter your ecstacy
Lay yourself now down to sleep
In my dreams you're mine to keep
