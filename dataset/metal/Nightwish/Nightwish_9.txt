[Intro]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel tonight
[Verse 1]
Deep into a dying day
I took a step outside an innocent heart
Prepare to hate me, fall when I may
This night will hurt you like never before
[Pre-Chorus]
Old loves, they die hard
Old lies, they die harder
[Chorus]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
[Bridge]
I'm going down so frail and cruel
Drunken disguise changes all the rules
[Pre-Chorus]
Old loves, they die hard
Old lies, they die harder
[Chorus]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Greatest thrill, not to kill
But to have the prize of the night
Hypocrite, wannabe friend
13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing!
Last dance, first kiss
Your touch, my bliss
Beauty always comes with dark thoughts
[Chorus]
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
[Outro]
I wish I had an angel...
I wish I had an angel...
I wish I had an angel...
I wish I had an angel...
