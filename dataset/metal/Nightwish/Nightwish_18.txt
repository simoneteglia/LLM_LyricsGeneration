I am the one you call
The Thief
Universe, blank verse, crowded hearse
I am a haven by an unseen stream
I`ll sing the dawn in with you
Now that you have a voice
Earthbride amongst the carrion kind
Walk with me to your sea
Someone in the tomorrow
Is waiting for me
Someone to share the Thief with
Dust with a meaning
Precious and rare
I am the grass, the maggots and the dust
I am the several endings
The pain of the slow evil of an unsung life
Decades, make them matter
Myriad tales shall befall on you
Before the evenballad of our stay
Walk with me to your sea
An unscarred land
Unsung yarn
Unborn child
Await my touch, the luck of the draw
Enter now
Come
Here is life
Endlessness
Soon, beyond the fields you`ve come to know
You will join the silent flow
Follow me, I am the spark
At the end of everything
Tip the Reaper to ensure
The blade is sharp
As soon we`ll go
Follow me into the dark
To the birth of everything
