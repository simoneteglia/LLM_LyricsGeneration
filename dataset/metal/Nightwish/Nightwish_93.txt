[Verse 1]
All those beautiful people
I want to have them all
All those porcelain models
If only I could make them fall
[Bridge]
Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above
[Verse 2]
A wintry eve
Once upon a tale
An
Ugly Duckling
Lost in a verse
Of a sparrows carol
Dreaming the stars
[Bridge]
Be my heart a well of love
Flowing free so far above
[Verse 3]
In my world
Love is for poets
Never the famous balcony scene
Just a dying faith
On the heaven's gate
[Outro]
Crystal pond awaits the lorn
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born
