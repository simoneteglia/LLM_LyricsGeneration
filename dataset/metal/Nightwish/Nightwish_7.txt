[Verse 1]
This is me for forever
One of the lost ones
The one without a name
Without an honest heart as compass
This is me for forever
One without a name
These lines the last endeavor
To find the missing lifeline
[Chorus 1]
Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
[Verse 2]
My flower, withered between
The pages two and three
The once and forever bloom gone with my sins
Walk the dark path
Sleep with angels
Call the past for help
Touch me with your love
And reveal to me my true name
[Chorus 2]
Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh, how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore
[Bridge]
Nemo sailing home
Nemo letting go
[Chorus 2]
Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh, how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh, how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore
[Outro]
Name forevermore
