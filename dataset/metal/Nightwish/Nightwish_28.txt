Denying the lying
A million children fighting
For lives in strife
For hope beyond the horizon
A dead world
A dark path
Not even crossroads to choose from
All the blood red carpets before me
Behold this fair creation of God
My only wish to leave behind
All the days of the earth
An everyday hell of my kingdom come
The first rock thrown again
Welcome to hell, little Saint
Mother Gaia in slaughter
Welcome to paradise, soldier
My first cry neverending
All life is to fear for life
You fool, you wanderer
You challenged the gods and lost
[Chorus]
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
Mankind works in mysterious ways
Welcome down to my Planet Hell
[Chorus]
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
Mankind works in mysterious ways
