[Verse 1]
Come and share this painting with me
Unveiling of me, the magician that never failed
This deep sigh coiled around my chest
Intoxicated by a major chord
I wonder
Do I love you or the thought of you?
[Chorus]
Slow, love, slow
Only the weak are not lonely
[Verse 2]
Southern blue, morning dew
Let-down-your-guards, I-love-you's
Ice-cream castles, lips-to-ear rhymes
A slumber deeper than time
[Chorus]
Slow, love, slow
Only the weak are not lonely
[Bridge]
Slow
Slow, love, slow
[Outro]
Slow, love, slow
Slow, slow
