[Verse 1]
These stories given to us all
Are filled with sacrifice and robes of lust
Dissonant choirs
and
downcast eyes
Selfhood of a condescending ape
Behold the crown of a heavenly spy
Forged in blood of those who defy
Kiss the ring, praise and sing
He loves you dwelling in fear and sin
[Pre-Chorus]
Fear is a choice you embrace
[Chorus]
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale
[Verse 2]
Pick your author from Ã  la carte fantasy
Filled with suffering and slavery
You live only for the days to come
Shoveling trash of the upper caste
Smiling mouth in a rotting head
Sucking dry the teat of the scared
A storytelling breed we are
A starving crew with show-off toys
[Pre-Chorus]
Fear is a choice you embrace
[Chorus]
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale
[Bridge: Marco Hietala]
From words into war of the worlds
This one we forsake with scorn
From lies, the strength of our love
Mother's milk laced with poison for this newborn
[Bridge]
Wake up child, I have a story to tell
Once upon a time
[Chorus]
Your only truth
Tribal poetry
Witchcraft filling your void
Lust for fantasy
Male necrocracy
Every child worthy of a better tale
