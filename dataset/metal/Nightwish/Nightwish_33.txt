[Chorus]
It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a Birth
[Verse 1]
No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow
Angels, they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung
[Chorus]
It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
[Verse 2]
Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug
[Chorus]
It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a Birth
[Bridge 1]
Mandylion
without a face
Deathwish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence
[Bridge 1]
Mandylion
without a face
Deathwish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence
[Chorus]
It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
[Bridge 2]
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
[Chorus]
It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
It is the End of all Hope
To lose the child, the Faith
End of all hope
