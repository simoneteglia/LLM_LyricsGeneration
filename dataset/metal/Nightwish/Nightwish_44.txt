[Geraldine James]
“There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is a rapture on the lonely shore, There is society, where none intrudes
By the deep Sea, and music in its roar: I love not Man the less, but Nature more”
[Instrumental]
The quote is from Lord Byron’s “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage” poem
