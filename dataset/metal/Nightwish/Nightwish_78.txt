One more night
To bear this nightmare
What more do I have to say
Crying for me
Was never worth a tear
My lonely soul is only filled with fear
Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea
Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wish to be
One with the waves
Ocean soul
Walking the tide line
I hear your name
Is angels whispering
Something so beautiful it hurts
Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea
I only wished
To become something beautiful
Through my music, through my silent devotion
Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wish to be
One with the waves
Ocean soul
Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wish to be
One with the waves
Ocean soul
