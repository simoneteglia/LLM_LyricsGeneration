[Verse 1]
We live in every moment but this one
Why don't we recognize the faces loving us so
What's God if not the spark that started life
Smile of a stranger
Sweet music, starry skies
Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes
Early wake-ups in a moving home
Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun
Open theme park gates waiting for
[Pre-Chorus]
Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home
[Chorus]
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day
[Post-Chorus]
The last ride of the day
[Verse 2]
Wake up, Dead Boy
Enter adventureland
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real
Careless jugglers, snakecharmers by your trail
Magic of a moment
Abracadabra
[Pre-Chorus]
Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home
[Chorus]
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day
[Chorus]
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day
[Post-Chorus]
The last ride of the day
