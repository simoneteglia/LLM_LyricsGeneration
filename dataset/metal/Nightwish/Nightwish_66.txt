6:30 winter morn
Snow keeps falling, silent dawn
A rose by any other name
Eva leaves her Swan brook home
Kindest heart which always made
Me ashamed of my own
She walks alone but not without her name
[Chorus]
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
Mocked by man to depths of shame
Little girl with life ahead
For a memory of one kind word
She would stay among the beasts
Time for one more daring dream
Before her escape, Eden beam
We kill with her own loving heart
[Chorus]
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
