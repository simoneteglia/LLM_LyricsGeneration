"Get away from me!
Take heed to thyself and see my face no more!
For in the day thou see my face
Thou shalt die!"
A constellation of divine architecture built on Earth
A holy harbour - Orion
Nautical ascension to the firmament
Ship-shaped barrows open my heart to the wisdom of this land
Sailing with the Serpent Chimera of a fiendish sandman
The Unicorn arrives with the westwind to dream His funeral
"
Thou art born for Horus, for Horus dwells in thee
"
Slumbering with the ebb and the flow of this foaming tomb
"Thou art born for Seteh, for Seteh dwells in thee"
Reveal your face to me and guide me through the Stygian fields
Enthral my soul to Sepedet's beams to serve your will
Sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance
Tales like the ocean written to the Draco's glance
Ruling with the scythe of death you tear our philosophies apart
An ancient starwalk to merge into the stars
"Open thy veins for my venom
Kiss the cobras with thy twisted tongue
So shalt thou join the empyrean circus
Where beggars mourn and seraphs dance
In this twilight cathedral
Shall I wed thee
O Bride of the Netherworld"
Sailing on the distant seas from darkness to deliverance
Tales like the ocean written to the Draco's glance
Ruling with the scythe of death you tear our philosophies apart
An ancient starwalk
Join my soul the Hunter in the sky
