[Verse 1]
In this chasm, lying broken
Is a child, charred inside
No more is there any hope
Shattered bones, bloodied scars
[Bridge]
Deliver me towards the soil
Close up the sun, grant me rest
In worms' coil
[Pre-Chorus]
It's so beautiful
World outside of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in what will never be
[Chorus]
Prayed to be free
Broken, on my knees
God won't appear
When all light dies
[Verse 2]
It's my only wish to die
Free myself from your reign of terror
So many times, swear I died
Why won't the blood loss kill me?
[Bridge]
Deliver me towards the soil
Close up the sun, grant me rest
In worms' coil
[Pre-Chorus]
It's so beautiful
World outside of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in what will never be
[Chorus]
Prayed to be free
Broken, on my knees
God won't appear
When all light dies
[Breakdown]
Make me swear, if I see your face again
I'd make you pay for the years of abuse
Fuck you
Tie you up, make you bleed, tear you apart
Limb from limb, so many years, I've held this in
I want to take your life
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Make me swear, if I see your face again
Tie you up, make you bleed
Just like me
