[Verse 1]
Shepherd is chased by the wolves
Wolves who live by intolerance and hate
For what they couldn't understand
Blinded and vicious are the beasts
Beating and ripping at a beautiful human
Who did nothing more than be himself
[Chorus]
Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear
[Verse 2]
Scarecrow is left crucified
Left freezing, bleeding, tied, and wondering why
The wolves just couldn't understand
It's the preachers and the teachers
Government's close-minded creatures try to teach us
To hate that which is different
[Chorus]
Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear
[Bridge]
It's 12:53 A.M., October 12th, when the scarecrow died
A victim of society's cruelty
It's 12:53 A.M., October 12th, when the shepherd died
The candle's light will alight your departure
[Solo: Heafy]
[Chorus]
Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Chorus/Outro]
Tied to the fence as they break you
(Tied to the fence as they break you)
And sadness will sear
(And sadness will sear)
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
(Cold is the wind that will freeze you)
And sadness will sear
(And sadness will sear)
