[Verse 1]
How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns, alight the air
Fire of passion, ignite
Open yourselves to fight
[Verse 2]
To reignite the will
Deafening call to kill
[Bridge]
The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence
[Pre-Chorus]
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation, new serenity
Destruction, disharmony
[Chorus]
To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this...
[Verse 3]
Gazing at twilights whole
Arms raised, chant, extol
[Bridge]
The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence
[Pre-Chorus]
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation, new serenity
Destruction, disharmony
[Chorus]
To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this
Dream
[Guitar Solo]
[Breakdown]
If our world ended today, would you suffer
Or just sit there, awaiting damnation?
[Verse 1 Reprise]
How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns, alight the air
[Bridge]
The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence
[Pre-Chorus]
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation, new serenity
Destruction, disharmony
[Chorus]
To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this
Dream
