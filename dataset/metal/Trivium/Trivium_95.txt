[Verse 1]
With my hands around your throat
That's the way I like you most
When you're choking on the
Feelings rushing out
I just want to hate
The same way that you hate
So that I don't feel this love
No more
I'm choking on the feelings
Rushing out
I'm choking on the feelings
Rushing out
[Verse 2]
Time won't open up its wings
Let me fall from grace
And land into the flames
I don't want to feel this love go cold
I don't know how you opened up
This light before
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out
[Chorus]
Wake
It's only getting worse
Wake
Behold this bitter curse
Wake
It's only getting worse
The end is nigh
Wake
It's only getting worse
Wake
Behold this bitter curse
Wake
It's only getting worse
The end is nigh
[Post-Chorus]
Take it away
Every second of pain
Like a stake through the brain
Existence—inhumane
[Bridge]
Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breeding?
Why stay alive when dying
Is much easier?
[Chorus]
Wake
It's only getting worse
Wake
Behold this bitter curse
Wake
It's only getting worse
The end is nigh
Wake
It's only getting worse
Wake
Behold this bitter curse
Wake
It's only getting worse
The end is nigh
[Post-Chorus]
Take it away
Every second of pain
Like a stake through the brain
Existence—inhumane
[Bridge]
Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breeding?
Why stay alive when dying
Is much easier?
Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breeding?
Why stay alive when dying
Is much easier?
[Bridge 2]
It's not gonna end the way you want
The end is nigh
It's not gonna end the way you want
The end is nigh
We've wasted away every second and day
Trying to ascertain our dominion and faith
It's not gonna end the way you want
The end is nigh
The end is nigh
[Solo: Beaulieu | Solo: Heafy]
[Outro]
The end is nigh
The end is nigh
The end is nigh
The end is nigh
The end is nigh...
