[Verse 1]
My anxiety's clawing
Out from deep within me
It burns within as my throat
Begins to cauterize
This negativity's leeching
Any shred of composure
Rationale has decayed and left
Me bound in madness
[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul
[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
[Verse 2]
How I yearn for the silence
For an end to the voices
The calamity grows and the
Deafness leads to disarray
Guilt buries me alive
In a coffinâ€”criticized
I shouldered the blame and dug
This hole for me to lay in
[Pre-Chorus]
I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul
[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
[Interlude]
I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I...
[Solo: Beaulieu | Solo: Heafy]
[Chorus]
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way
