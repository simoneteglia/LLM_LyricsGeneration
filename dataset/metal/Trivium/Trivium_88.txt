[Verse 1]
A poor man with four daughters
A wife and a son
Daughter commits adultery
Or so he was told
Bought a knife and machete
After Friday's prayers
Feared the young would follow old
Thought all must be killed
[Refrain]
For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered
[Pre-Chorus]
Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
A shamed madman
[Chorus]
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take, you take their lives away
[Breakdown]
Yet a man unrepentant
Don't you realize
You murdered your own children
Call that honorable cause?
[Refrain]
For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered
[Pre-Chorus]
Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
A shamed madman
[Chorus]
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take, you take their lives away
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Refrain]
For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered
[Pre-Chorus]
Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
A shamed madman
[Chorus]
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take, you take their lives away
