[Verse 1]
I am
Disintegrating
As I set fire (set fire)
To the
Life that I once knew
In my last stand (last stand)
[Pre-Chorus]
To break free (To break free, to break free)
From the ghost of me (ghost of me)
I burn it down (burn it down, burn it down)
A past life to the ground, to the ground
[Chorus]
A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance
[Verse 2]
Dying
Seemed appropriate
For the old me (old me)
Living
Was so much harder
Lone and longing (longing)
[Pre-Chorus]
To break free (to break free, to break free)
From the ghost of me (ghost of me)
I burn it down (burn it down, burn it down)
A past life to the ground, to the ground
[Chorus]
A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance
[Bridge]
It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will drown
[Guitar Solo]
It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will drown
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance
[Outro]
Cleave from creation's hands
