[Verse 1]
Bow not before his creation
These mortals: "man"
This act of insult
Breeds our discontent
He turned his back
On our loyalty
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
[Pre-Chorus]
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hellfire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven
[Chorus]
Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war
[Verse 2]
It is I who spawns this fury
Torches: ignite
Blaze is set to engulf all of which we hate
Storm in, eviscerate
Every motherfucker in our way
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
[Pre-Chorus]
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hellfire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven
[Chorus]
Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war
[Bridge]
Ascend to the heavens
To destroy them all
Ascend to the heavens
To destroy them all
Ascend to the heavens
To destroy them all
[Solo: Corey Beaulieu]
[Solo: Matt Heafy]
[Chorus]
Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war
Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war
