[Intro]
Go
[Verse 1]
I'm calling out to you, can you hear me?
Numb and disconnected, just beyond your sight
I'm not myself anymore
But I'm not alone
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
[Chorus]
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
[Verse 2]
I'm holding onto you, do you feel me?
Trapped but unaffected, like a memory
I'm waiting for a sign of life
And I can't let go
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let go
I can't let go
[Chorus]
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
[Bridge]
Is this the light
Or a distant mirror?
You've kept me for yourself
That much is clear
[Chorus]
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
[Outro]
What the dead men say
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
