[Verse 1]
As I stand at the edge of existence
Nameless shores of infinity
[Bridge]
Perpetual un-birth, unraveling distance
Clandestine truths unveiled
[Verse 2]
Inborn imperfections, preprogrammed shells
Spawning from the maelstrom
[Bridge]
Mechanical drones feeding from thy mother
God machine, reproduce
[Pre-Chorus]
Untruth, is this my fate?
Coerced, my life laid to waste
Untruth, is this my fate?
Coerced, my life laid to waste
All hail execution
[Chorus]
As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble, truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal hell
[Verse 3]
Disturbed state of consciousness
Incessant black madness
[Bridge]
Perpetual un-birth, unraveling distance
Clandestine truths unveiled
[Pre-Chorus]
Untruth, is this my fate?
Coerced, my life laid to waste
Untruth, is this my fate?
Coerced, my life laid to waste
All hail execution
[Chorus]
As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble, truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal hell
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Untruth, is this my fate?
Coerced, my life laid to waste
Untruth, is this my fate?
Coerced, my life laid to waste
All hail execution
[Chorus]
As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble, truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal hell
As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble, truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal hell
