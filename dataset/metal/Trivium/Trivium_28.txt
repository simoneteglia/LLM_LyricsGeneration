[Chorus]
I, I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
[Verse 1]
I felt your heart stop beating
With my own two hands
I felt my life lose meaning
I'll never be whole again
I held you in my arms
As she injected you with death
We made you feel like there was nothing wrong
[Refrain]
It won't stop
Replaying in my head
The opened eyes and mouth
Of my beloved
Who now is dead
[Verse 2]
I felt your heart stop beating
With my own two hands
I felt my life lose meaning
I'll never be whole again
I watched you start to fall
So I eased you to the ground
You looked both panicked and at peace
[Refrain]
It won't stop
Replaying in my head
The opened eyes and mouth
Of my beloved
Who now is dead
[Chorus]
I, I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
[Post-Chorus]
(My sickness unto you)
My sickness unto you
[Bridge]
(A part of me is fucking dead
My lungs have filled up with regret
For every day I was away
I'll never be whole again)
A part of me is fucking dead (Dead)
My lungs have filled up with regret
For every day I was away
I'll never be whole again
A part of me is fucking dead (Dead)
My lungs have filled up with regret
For every day I was away
I'll never be whole again
[Refrain]
It won't stop
Replaying in my head
The opened eyes and mouth
Of my beloved
Who now is dead
[Chorus]
I, I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
My sickness unto you
My sickness unto you
