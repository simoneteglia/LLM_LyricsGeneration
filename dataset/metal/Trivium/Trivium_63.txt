[Verse 1]
As I descend, I see the end
It’s reaching up to pull me in
The bowels of Hell, a prison cell
It’s decorated with my sin
[Pre-Chorus]
I smash the shackles
That have bound me
Your world is toxic
Now sink and let me be
[Chorus]
Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy
Please pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So pull me from the void
From emptiness, you find yourself in time
[Verse 2]
As I ascend, need not defend
My reasons that I must avenge
A dying dream, unspoken thing
I cleave myself from you; I’m free
[Pre-Chorus]
I smash the shackles
That have bound me
Your world is toxic
Now sink and let me be
[Chorus]
Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy
Please pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So pull me from the void
From emptiness, you find yourself in time
[Breakdown]
Revelation
Liberation
[Solo]
Revelation
[Chorus]
Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy
Please pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So pull me from the void
From emptiness, you find yourself in time
