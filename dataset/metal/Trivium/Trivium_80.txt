[Verse 1]
She’d rather let the ocean take her inside its wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
[Chorus]
Rise
Rise above the tides
(Rise)
The waves will pull you under if you don’t fight
[Verse 2]
Slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea
Unconcerned that there’s no oxygen since she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
[Chorus]
Rise
Rise above the tides
(Rise)
The waves will pull you under if you don’t fight
Rise
Rise above the tides
(Rise)
Don’t allow yourself to give up on life
[Solo]
[Interlude]
We’re lost forever
Lost together
We’re lost forever
Lost together
[Verse 1: Reprise]
She’d rather let the ocean take her inside its wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
[Bride]
Find the strength to be
The waves will pull you down
Underneath to drown
[Chorus]
Rise
Rise above the tides
(Rise)
The waves will pull you under if you don’t fight
Rise
Rise above the tides
(Rise)
Don’t allow yourself to give up on life
