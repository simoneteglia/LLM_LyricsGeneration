[Verse 1]
Take away all of this pain
Life feels like it's all in vain
Life feels like it's all in vain
Blindingly, it seeps through the trees
Burning bright, subconscious streams
Falling light, dismantled dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were
Never meant to make it this far
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were
Never meant to make it this far
[Chorus]
I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays
[Verse 2]
We are all damaged and wrong
Practicing for death alone
Practicing for death alone
Hope has gone cold with its cause
Lost inside its every flaw
Life is finally swallowed raw
[Pre-Chorus]
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were
Never meant to make it this far
[Chorus]
I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays
I’m covered fast
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays
[Solo]
[Bridge]
With the end in sight
I clench what's left of light
Press it against my head
And dream of the color red
With the end in sight
I clench what's left of light
Press it against my head
And dream of the color red
[Chorus]
I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays
I’m covered fast
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays (of all these yesterdays)
[Chorus]
I feel the rage (I feel the rage)
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays (of all these yesterdays)
I’m covered fast (I feel the rage)
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays
[Outro]
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were
Never meant to make it this far
