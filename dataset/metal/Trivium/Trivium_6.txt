[Intro]
In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves
[Chorus]
Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, in waves)
Do I take everybody else down
(Everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?
[Refrain]
In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves
[Chorus]
Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, in waves)
Do I take everybody else down
(Everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?
I know that death approaches fast
(In waves, in waves)
What's the purpose if this life won't last?
(What's the purpose?)
Pulling everyone down with me

Perpetually, we are igniting in waves (igniting in waves)
(Incessantly)
Incessantly, we are sinking in flames (flames)
