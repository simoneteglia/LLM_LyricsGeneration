[Verse 1]
If you could break down and put yourself together
Then would all the pieces ever fit the same?
If you could see all the ways we're tied together
Would you pull apart the ugliness and shame?
[Pre-Chorus]
Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
On a higher plane than any one of us
Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
Tell me now, which side do you fall?
[Chorus]
Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(The ones we leave behind)
No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind
[Verse 2]
If we could break through the structures built between us
Then would all the fault lines simply disappear?
If we could fight back (Fight back) and bring ourselves together
Then our sacrifices will not be in vain (Will not be in vain)
[Pre-Chorus]
Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
On a higher plane than any one of us
Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
Tell me now, which side do you fall?
[Chorus]
Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(The ones we leave behind)
No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind
[Bridge]
If you could break down (Down) and put yourself together
Then would all the pieces ever fit the same?
[Chorus]
Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind (Gods walk amongst all)
(The ones we leave behind)
No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind
