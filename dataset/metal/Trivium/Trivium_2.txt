[Verse 1]
I heard the passing bells calling out my name
I knew I'd never see another day
I couldn't swim against the tides of blame
I knew there was no other way
[Pre-Chorus]
You better practice your lines
You better practice your words
I know that real monsters lie
Between the light and the shade
It doesn't matter what you say or feel
When honest men become deranged
They'll genuflect to a lie
[Chorus]
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
[Verse 2]
I saw the dagger eyes staring back at me
I knew I'd never have a chance to plead
Guilty, but in the sight of fallen men
They bury you before you speak
(You don't understand us)
[Pre-Chorus]
You better practice your lines
You better practice your words
I know that real monsters lie
Between the light and the shade
It doesn't matter what you say or feel
When honest men become deranged
They'll genuflect to a lie
[Chorus]
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
[Bridge]
Beware those who speak in tongues
For they may call your name
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
[Pre-Chorus]
They'll genuflect to a lie
[Chorus]
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
[Bridge]
Beware those who speak in tongues
For they may call your name
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
Fuck!
[Outro]
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
