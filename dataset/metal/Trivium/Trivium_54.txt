[Verse 1]
Banished immortal
Deformed out of recognition
Everything believed in was dead
Floundered in the void
Suffering the constant scourge
Cursed to walk alone amongst the stars
[Pre-Chorus]
A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun
A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun
[Chorus]
Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me
[Verse 2]
Old ones now emergе
Evil beyond comprehension
Bringing forth thе ending of all men
Captive in their stare
Deafening, their voices heard
Anomie, broken by their words
[Pre-Chorus]
A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun
A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun
[Chorus]
Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me
[Bridge]
Waiting for all of it to fall
Waiting for all of it to fall
[Guitar Solo]
Waiting for all of it to fall
Waiting for all of it to fall
[Verse 3]
Banished immortal
Deformed out of recognition
Everything believed in was dead
Floundered in the void
Suffering the constant scourge
Cursed to walk alone amongst the stars
[Pre-Chorus]
A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun
A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun
[Chorus]
Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me
Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me
