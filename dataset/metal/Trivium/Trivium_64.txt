[Intro]
We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding
We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding
[Verse 1]
A fire burns
In the back of
The throat
Let it out, let it out
Before the
Choke
[Chorus]
Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal
[Post-Chorus]
Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out
Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out
[Verse 2]
I dig a hole
Through what's left of
My world
Searching for something more
I turn it
Inwards
[Chorus]
Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal
[Solo]
[Bridge]
I'm falling, I'm falling
In this colossal void (In this colossal void)
Each day that I spent digging downward
Built me up for a higher fall
[Chorus]
Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal
[Outro]
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
