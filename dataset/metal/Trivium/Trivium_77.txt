[Refrain]
Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision
[Verse 1]
That's the sound of integrity breaking its back
In a country founded as a thievery act
[Refrain]
Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision
[Verse 2]
Times are dark with our children spoon-fed ignorance
Inheritance of an anxious trigger finger
[Refrain]
Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision
[Pre-Chorus]
Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, sexism
Our systems breed supremacy
[Chorus]
Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
[Verse 3]
Time again for a war
On an enemy that isn't real
Greedy, selfish warlords
Feed the agenda; death's the meal
[Solo: Heafy]
[Breakdown]
That's the sound
Impending fear crawling up your spine
In a country where nothing is truly made clear
[Refrain]
Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision
[Pre-Chorus]
Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, sexism
Our systems breed supremacy
[Chorus]
Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
