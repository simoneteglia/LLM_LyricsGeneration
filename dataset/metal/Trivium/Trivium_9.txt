[Intro]
He who walks the fire breathes!
[Verse 1]
He who walks the fire breathes
Unlike the rest
Living by the bloody creed
Kiri-sute gomen
[Verse 2]
Air of battle tasting stale
Reeks of deceit
Send the bitter straight to hell
Kiri-sute gomen
[Pre-Chorus]
In their wretched guts, all they want is to feed
Unending, covetous hunger known as greed
As the last legion makes its way to the skies
[Chorus]
I can see in their eyes
They've already died
Inside, but as for the outside
I'll take their fucking heads
[Verse 3]
Quake has bred with the storm
Conceiving war
Wicked stampeding hordes
Kiri-sute gomen
[Pre-Chorus]
In their wretched guts, all they want is to feed
Unending, covetous hunger known as greed
As the last legion makes its way to the skies
[Chorus]
I can see in their eyes
They've already died
Inside, but as for the outside
I'll take their fucking heads
I can see in their eyes
They've already died
Inside, but as for the outside
I'll take their fucking heads
[Bridge 1]
I will never be what they
Want me to
I live by my own path in life
No turning
Back now, I won't be held down
Forced into a shallow grave
Built upon their empty ways
There's no turning back
[Bridge 2]
There's hell to pay, such disarray
A bloodied mess, flesh masquerade
With all the blood making a flood
You made your path by crossing us
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
He who spits the fire seethes
All he detests
Decapitating, bloody creed
Kiri-sute gomen
[Pre-Chorus]
In their wretched guts, all they want is to feed
Unending, covetous hunger known as greed
As the last legion makes its way to the skies
[Chorus]
I can see in their eyes
They've already died
Inside, but as for the outside
I'll take their fucking heads
[Outro]
I will never be what they
Want me to
I live by my own path in life
No turning
Back now, I won't be held down
Forced into a shallow grave
Built upon their empty ways
No turning
I will never be what they
Want me to
I live by my own path in life
There's no turning back
