[Verse 1]
Here we all stand on this canvas of white
Our palette holds but only one shade tonight
Silence snows in, in her wintery chill
Let’s paint the ground red with the blood of our kill
[Pre-Chorus]
Kill
The battle goes
[Chorus]
Silence in the snow
We must fight 'til they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow
[Verse 2]
Hell hath no hold on a warrior’s mind
See how the snow has made each of us blind
Vibrant colors spray from new dead
Staining the earth such a beautiful red
[Pre-Chorus]
Red
The battle goes
On and on
Make your stand
[Chorus]
Silence in the snow
We must fight 'til they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow
[Bridge]
I’m left in the cold
As winter unfolds
The blood on my hands is my own
[Chorus]
Silence in the snow
We must fight 'til they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow
[Outro]
Silence in the snow
Silence in the snow
