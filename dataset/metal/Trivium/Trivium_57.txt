[Verse 1]
You cannot be, you're the mistake: calamity
Sent to destroy all of the good
On this Earth, killing me
You're killing me
The mother of ruination comes to fuck all
Mutilating everything, spread wide open
Beckoning
Beckoning me
[Pre-Chorus]
Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful
[Chorus]
The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence
[Verse 2]
Spewed from the wound of this life's worst cavity
The nightmare spreads its cancerous lamentations
Poisoning
Force-feed the plague
Drunk from the milk of death's overflowing, sick tit
Nourishing the misery, gives birth to the ugliness
That grows inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful
[Chorus]
The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence
[Bridge]
Isolate
The heart from the brain
Permeate
Inject us with pain
Holding our breath now
We're screaming without sound
We're trembling as everything falls completely apart
Meteor crash down
Come crater our woe out
The banishment of everything once alive will start now
[Solo]
[Verse 3]
Holding our breath now
We're screaming without sound
The banishment of everything once alive will start now
You came to be, you're the mistake: calamity
Here to destroy all of the good on this Earth
Killing all
Killing us all
[Pre-Chorus]
Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful
[Chorus]
The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence
