[Verse 1]
I was so empty
Self-loathing
Before you awoke me
Lived in transgression
Feasted sin
Destroying all I stood for
[Pre-Chorus]
A world of spreading disease
Legs up for infidelity
They force-feed of their stiffened sickness
The promised hiding their rings
To suck down some of the things
That cheat this world into lovelessness
[Chorus]
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever
[Verse 2]
In arms, we'll turn 'way
From their ways
We'll live like no other
Together, we're hope
Absolute
The only thing that matters
[Pre-Chorus]
A world of spreading disease
Legs up for infidelity
They force-feed of their stiffened sickness
The promised hiding their rings
To suck down some of the things
That cheat this world into lovelessness
[Chorus]
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever
[Solo: Heafy]
[Refrain]
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
[Chorus]
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever
[Solo: Beaulieu]
