[Verse 1]
Churning through the miseries
I find a tear unshed
This emptiness inside of me
It brings me out for dead
[Pre-Chorus]
Compulsiveness for self-destruction
Impulse led by entropy
[Chorus]
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur
[Verse 2]
Sunlight falters
As we wait, the world goes up in flames
I know we will be the ones
To fill up all these graves
[Pre-Chorus]
Compulsiveness for self-dеstruction
Impulse led by entropy
[Chorus]
I'm crawling
Crawling through thе feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur
[Bridge]
It was all a blur and then it was nothing
It was all a blur and then it was nothing
[Guitar Solo]
Churning through the miseries
I find a tear unshed
This emptiness inside of me
It brings me out for dead
Sunlight falters
As we wait, the world goes up in flames
I know we will be the ones
To fill up all these graves
[Chorus]
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur
[Outro]
It was all a blur and then it was nothing
It was all a blur and then it was nothing
Nothing
