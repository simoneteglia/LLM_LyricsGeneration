[Verse 1]
Is it a sin
To miss the hell
That you survived
With best of friends
At worst of times?
I never got the answer
They never told me
If you're not careful
What doesn't kill you
Can control you
Now it defines me
And it reminds me
That it will never let me go
[Pre-Chorus]
If we share the pain
Then maybe we won't have to bury memories away
[Chorus]
I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night
[Verse 2]
When it gets dark
I cannot breathe
It's only the sound
Of grinding teeth
Afraid of the silence
And its lurking violence
Your empty words
The feigned concern
We go through the motions
I'll never return
'Cause it still defines me
And it reminds me
That it will never let me go
[Pre-Chorus]
If we share the pain
Then maybe we won't have to bury memories away
[Chorus]
I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night
I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night
[Chorus]
I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night
[Post-Chorus 1]
Is it a sin
To miss the hell
That you survived
With best of friends
At worst of times?
I fight another endless night
[Chorus]
I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night
[Post-Chorus 2]
When it gets dark
I cannot breathe
It's only the sound
Of grinding teeth
Afraid of the silence
I fight another endless night
