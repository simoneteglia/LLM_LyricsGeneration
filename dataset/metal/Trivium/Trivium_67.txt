[Verse 1]
Destined to burn
Those words carved into their heads
Fearful they won't say his name, they gaze
Off afar, in mute dismay
Nothing left sacred
[Pre-Chorus]
We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers
We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers
[Verse 2]
We must admit
Our punishment is deserved
Callous to those that surround us all
Reaping in service of self
Fruit from a dying womb
[Pre-Chorus]
We are the ones who burn it all to thе ground
As we say our prayers
We arе the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers
[Chorus]
So we fall (Fall)
Fall into your hands
So we fall (Fall)
Fall into your hands
So we fall
Fall into your hands
Fall (Fall)
Fall into your hands
[Post-Chorus]
Go
[Bridge]
Sanctioned to serve
Brought to your knees
Lost inside my head
Freedom to bleed
Summoned from the depths (Summoned from the depths)
Crawl towards the sky
A fleeting light breaks through
The dark and bitter sky
Sanctioned to serve
Brought to your knees
Lost inside my head
Freedom to bleed
Summoned from the depths
Crawl towards the sky
A fleeting light breaks through
The dark and bitter sky
What if we were meant to fail?
What if we were meant to die?
What if we were meant to fail?
Running for our whole lives
[Verse 3]
Destined to burn
Those words carved into their heads
Fearful they won't say his name, they gaze
Off afar, in mute dismay
Nothing left sacred
[Pre-Chorus]
We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers
[Chorus]
So we fall (Fall)
Fall into your hands
So we fall (Fall)
Fall into your hands
So we fall
Fall into your hands
Fall
Fall into your hands
Fall
