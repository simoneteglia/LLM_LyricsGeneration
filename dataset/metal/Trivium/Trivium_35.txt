[Intro]
Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow
[Bridge]
So young
Did it even matter?
So young
Did it even matter?
[Verse 1]
It felt so strange
Living in my grave
Count each breath
Waiting to expire
Remember home
Dying here alone
Hollow words
Anthems from the choir
[Chorus]
Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow
[Post-Chorus]
The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all?
The beauty in the sorrow
[Bridge]
So young
Did it even matter?
So young
Did it even matter?
[Verse 2]
It felt so strange
Looking at your grave
An early end
I read letters to remember
So I moved on
Or so the story goes
Shots rang out
Red flowers, a reminder
[Chorus]
Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow
The beauty in the sorrow
The beauty in the sorrow
[Bridge]
So young
Did it even matter?
So young
Did it even matter?
[Chorus]
Can we make sense of it all?
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow
[Post-Chorus]
The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all?
The beauty in the sorrow
