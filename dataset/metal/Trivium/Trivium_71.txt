[Intro]
Oh...
Oh...
[Verse 1]
A common woman
Lives by the Bible
Wedlocked, a prison
Of antiquation
Brings life to the earth
While losing her mind
Trying suicide
Hallucinating Satan
[Chorus]
Forcing her own blood down
Beneath the waters to drown
Lying dead with eyes wide open
[Verse 2]
Spiraling downward
Refusing all help
Self-mutilation
Neglects the children
Dagger licks her neck
Desiring escape
Succumbing Satan
Robbed by the seventh deadly sin
[Chorus]
Forcing her own blood down
Beneath the waters to drown
Lying dead with eyes wide open
Believing Satan was inside
Ordering to abide
To destroy her cursed children
[Breakdown]
Entrance of the conflagration
(Oh...)
Entrance of the conflagration
(Oh...)
Go!
[Solo: Beaulieu / Heafy]
[Refrain]
Oh...
Oh...
[Verse 3]
Conditions worsen
Searching for answers
In Holy Scriptures
Systematic plan
Water fills the tub
All of her children
Floating lifelessly
Innocence chased down and drowned
(Chased down and drowned)
[Chorus]
Forcing her own blood down
Beneath the waters to drown
Lying dead with eyes wide open
Believing Satan was inside
Ordering to abide
To destroy her cursed children
