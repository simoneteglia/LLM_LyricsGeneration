[Verse 1]
Don't let this ruin all that I thought that I could be
A life amidst entropy is a fate I refuse to see
[Pre-Chorus]
As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell
[Verse 2]
Fall fast down from grace
The world tries to make me evil
Punished in this corrupt place
Life's so fucking medieval
[Pre-Chorus]
As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell
[Chorus]
They will try to pull us down
But we won't cave in
We have something that they can't take
We know the truth inside
'Cause I will fight this by all means
With poison, the knife, or the noose at me
[Verse 3]
Our world
Is a minefield
With explosives ready to eviscerate the living
Sabotage
The devious blindfold
You're helping cut a hole
From here to here below your mouth
A battlefield
This fucking battle's right here
With man killing man, we're only fueling our own extinction
[Solo: Heafy]
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Bridge]
Our world
Is a minefield
With explosives ready to eviscerate the living
A battlefield
This fucking battle's right here
With man killing man, we're only fueling our own extinction
[Verse 4]
Die if, in apathy, your submissiveness their weapon
Turn inertia into rage and ram it through like a spear
[Pre-Chorus]
As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell
[Chorus]
They will try to pull us down
But we won't cave in
We have something that they can't take
We know the truth inside
'Cause I will fight this by all means
With poison, the knife, or the noose at me
