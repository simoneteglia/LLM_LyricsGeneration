[Intro]
Betrayer
Betrayer
[Verse 1]
I say betrayer
I swear I've given you so much
Naysayer
I watched as you just lapped it up
Unwilling
Addicted to be without dignity
A cheater
You thrive on lechery
I don't know what I expected
Was our time even real?
Your callous heart never seemed affected
Does a liar even know how to feel?
[Pre-Chorus]
Unto you, I proclaim
Creonte
shall be your name
[Chorus]
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
[Post-Chorus]
Betrayer
Betrayer
[Verse 2]
You're calculating
I know you know exactly what you're doing
Your selfishness, your only cause
A fake
(Fake)
, a farce
(Farce)
You had us all convinced
No guilt
(Guilt)
, no heart
(Heart)
No love
(Love)
, no conscience held
[Pre-Chorus]
Unto you, I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name
[Chorus]
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
[Bridge]
Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now
Brought forth the end
For you, my friend
Time will not end
All these mistakes have now
Brought forth the end
For you, my friend
I say betrayer
[Verse 3]
A fake (fake), a farce (farce)
(You had us all convinced)
No guilt (guilt), no heart (heart)
No love (love), no conscience held
[Pre-Chorus]
Unto you, I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name
[Chorus]
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
