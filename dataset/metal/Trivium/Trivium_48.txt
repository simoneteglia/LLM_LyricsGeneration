[Verse 1]
Losing
Losing my faith in
The world that surrounds me
Am I
Am I the only one
To constantly question it all?
So
So far away
It’s ourselves that we betray
How has it come to this?
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss
[Pre-Chorus]
Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night
[Chorus]
Blind leading the blind to the sea
They’re drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
They’re falling down
You hear them calling
But it’s too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself
[Verse 2]
Calling
Calling for action
I demand that you question
Are you
Are you content with the truth
That they have fed down to you?
Think
Think for yourselves
You must break out from this hell
How has it come to this?
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss
[Pre-Chorus]
Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night
[Chorus]
Blind leading the blind to the sea
They’re drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
They’re falling down
You hear them calling
But it’s too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself
[Breakdown]
We must break
We must break free from this hell
We must break
We must break free from this hell
[Pre-Chorus]
Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night
[Chorus]
Blind leading the blind to the sea
They’re drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
They’re falling down
You hear them calling
But it’s too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself
[Outro]
Just save yourself
Save yourself
