[Verse 1]
Ghosts surrounding me, they’re taking shape
I wake and see them standing there
[Bridge]
What the hell
(What the hell are you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do
(When the whole world’s after you?)
When the world
(What the hell are you supposed to do)
Is coming after you?
(When the whole world’s after you?)
[Pre-Chorus]
What have I done?
What have I become?
Standing six feet deep
Am I the only one?
[Chorus]
Save
Save yourself
It’s killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way
Save
Save yourself
There’s nothing left to say or do
You know I’ll be the ghost that’s haunting you
[Verse 2]
Apparition, read me my last rites
Carry me into the grave
Grave
[Bridge]
What the hell
(What the hell are you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do
(When the whole world’s after you?)
When the world
(What the hell are you supposed to do)
Is coming after you?
(When the whole world’s after you?)
[Pre-Chorus]
What have I done?
What have I become?
Standing six feet deep
Am I the only one?
[Chorus]
Save
Save yourself
It’s killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way
Save
Save yourself
There’s nothing left to say or do
You know I’ll be the ghost that’s haunting you
[Breakdown]
The ghost that’s haunting you
[Solo]
[Chorus]
Save
Save yourself
It’s killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way
Save
Save yourself
There’s nothing left to say or do
You know I’ll be the ghost that’s haunting you
