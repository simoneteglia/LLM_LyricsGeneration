[Verse 1]
Within struggle, amidst horror
Inside conflict, visceral war
Make a stand here, vanquish all fear
Don't hesitate, eradicate
[Chorus]
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feel the fear ripening, go taste it
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feast fruits of valor, if you face it
[Verse 2]
Walls of carnage surround your weakness
Crash down like oceans, wait for the light
In total darkness, drowning in bleakness
Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life
[Refrain]
Divided by destiny
Torn between death and doom
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb
[Verse 3]
Apprehension runs down your chin
Masticate it, suck those tears in
Life's a battle, perpetual crusade
One against all, time to wield the blade
[Chorus]
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feel the fear ripening, go taste it
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feast fruits of valor, if you face it
[Verse 4]
In total darkness, drowning in bleakness
Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life
[Refrain]
Divided by destiny
Torn between death and doom
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb
A fight that tests the substance
Of all that you call your life
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb
[Solo: Corey Beaulieu]
[Bridge]
Face down that which makes you bleed
Turn it 'round and force your seed down
Down
[Solo: Paolo Gregoletto]
[Solo: Matt Heafy]
[Bridge]
Face down that which makes you bleed
Turn it 'round and force your seed down
Down
[Solo: Paolo Gregoletto]
[Chorus]
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feast fruits of valor, if you face it
[Verse 5]
Walls of carnage surround your weakness
Crash down like oceans, wait for the light
In total darkness, drowning in bleakness
Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life
[Refrain]
Divided by destiny
Torn between death and doom
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb
A fight that tests the substance
Of all that you call your life
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb
