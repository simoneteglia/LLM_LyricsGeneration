[Verse 1]
Liturgies and prophecies
They mean nothing to me
I believe in substance
Not the patterns that you see
[Pre-Chorus]
Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive
[Verse 2]
Straws you grip so tightly
Now becoming your own noose
Story collapsing, ask yourself
Can you hang from your own truth?
[Pre-Chorus]
Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive
[Chorus]
Sever the hand
Of any god or man
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again
Sever the hand
Of any god or man
(Of any god or man)
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again
Go!
[Bridge]
Mindlessly crawling
You're choked by a leash
Seeking redemption
You practice and preach
Cognitive failure
Your sickness reveals
The horror and panic
Exposing what's real
[Pre-Chorus]
Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive
[Chorus]
Sever the hand
Of any god or man
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again
Sever the hand
Of any god or man
(Of any god or man)
Sever the hand
To free yourself again
Free yourself again
