[Verse 1]
One by one, they fall to ensure liberty
Freedom fighters, raise your fists to ensure victory
[Pre-Chorus 1]
This life is a battle
We must fight to ensure (To ensure)
They can't take what's in our hearts
It's all that we truly own
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll try to take (Try to take)
What's really ours (Really ours)
They'll never take (Never take)
What's in our hearts
[Chorus]
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
[Verse 1 Reprise]
One by one, they fall to ensure liberty
Freedom fighters, raise your fists to ensure victory
[Pre-Chorus 1]
This life is a battle
We must fight to ensure (To ensure)
They can't take what's in our hearts
It's all that we truly own
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll try to take (Try to take)
What's really ours (Really ours)
They'll never take (Never take)
What's in our hearts
[Chorus]
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
[Bridge]
This war is on everything that you find comfort in
All I want is for your kind to burn
This war is on everything that you find comfort in
All I want is for your kind to burn
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They'll try to take (Try to take)
What's really ours (Really ours)
They'll never take (Never take)
What's in our hearts
[Chorus]
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
