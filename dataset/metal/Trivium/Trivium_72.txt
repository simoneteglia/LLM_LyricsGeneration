[Verse 1]
Shots fired, tensions grow higher
Both sides claim the other's a liar
These streets will run red
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the end
It's the end of the world and I can taste it
(No)
It's the end of the world, the fuse is lit
[Chorus]
Burn in the flames of the fire
Scream in the night like a choir
So cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same
[Verse 2]
Brothers at arms due to birthright
Raised in the dark with no foresight
A hate passed down for years
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the end
It's the end of the world and I can taste it
(No)
It's the end of the world, the fuse is lit
[Chorus]
Burn in the flames of the fire
Scream in the night like a choir
So cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same
[Breakdown]
It’s the end
(It’s the end)
Corpses and casings have littered the sands of time
(It's the end)
Women and children and men die at the frontlines
(It's the end)
[Interlude]
Burn in the flames of the fire
Scream in the night like a choir
[Outro]
Cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same
So cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same
