[Verse 1]
Taken forcefully
A thing which never can be
Erased by time
Since he made you bleed, so violently
Painful is the kick
Inside it makes you so sick
The blood that drips down your thigh
Tarnishes virtue; lies
[Pre-Chorus]
Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life
Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life
Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven
[Chorus]
Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath
[Verse 2]
Now a forsaken
Ghost in the eyes of her world
Banished for all time
Since he made you bleed, so violently
Painful is the kick
Inside it makes you so sick
The blood that drips down your thigh
Tarnishes virtue; lies
[Pre-Chorus]
Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life
Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life
Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven
[Chorus]
Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath
Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath
[Bridge 1]
Cast out from the righteous life you loved
Vengeance comes down from the skies above
To wreak havoc and torment the one
Who just gave birth to her true love's son
[Solo: Heafy]
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Bridge 2]
Cursed to roam the Earth alone, a beast
Witnesses as her son now fully grown
Readied arm to cast a spear, to kill
Can't recognize, all he sees is fear
[Pre-Chorus]
Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life
Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life
[Chorus]
Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath
Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath
