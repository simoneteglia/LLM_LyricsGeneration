[Verse 1]
Dark winter
Necrotic
Seems this will never end
Transgressions
My burdens are forever
Denial
Holding on
Its grip, it chokes the life
Of what was and will be
The eternal present
[Pre-Chorus]
Who of you will dare to sit in the throne?
Who of you will dare?
[Chorus]
You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles
[Verse 2]
Declension
This poison
The power killing me
Detachment
Who am I?
What have I done?
The violence
Full of hate
The habit of our sins
Atonement buried in an unmarked grave
[Pre-Chorus]
Who of you will dare to sit in the throne?
Who of you will dare?
[Chorus]
You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles
[Bridge]
Is it all you hoped for?
Is it all that you dreamed?
Is it all you hoped for?
Feel the weight being king
Is it all you hoped for?
Feel the weight being king
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Who of you will dare to sit in the throne?
Who of you will dare?
[Chorus]
You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles
You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles
