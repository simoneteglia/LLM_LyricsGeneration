[Verse 1]
All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down
From what I was supposed to be
[Chorus]
Ascend above the ashes
Of the world I once knew
[Verse 1 Reprise]
All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down
From what I was supposed to be
[Chorus]
Ascend above the ashes
Of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove
[Breakdown]
Go!
I spread the fuel with ire
Desire (desire)
To incinerate all
Behold I rise
Phoenix!
Phoenix!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Ascend above the ashes!
Ascend above it all!
Ascend above the ashes!
Ascend above it all!
[Guitar Harmony]
[Pre-Chorus]
Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down
From what I was supposed to be
Was supposed to be!
[Chorus]
Ascend above the ashes
Of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing
This will prove
Ascend above the ashes
Of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing
This will prove
