[Verse 1]
I am but a farce, a satire of stability
Insecurity is an uphill struggle
It's me versus the world
The shore still starves for another
[Refrain]
Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, alive, still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out
[Verse 2]
My hands shake in apprehension
Of every action, I'm guilty of playing the victim
The shore still starves for another
[Refrain]
Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, alive, still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out
[Chorus]
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
[Breakdown]
It's time for your panic
Then it kills and makes you manic
[Bridge]
Making its way inside—relax; it's all right
Making its way inside—relax; it's all right
Panic grips your frantic breathing
I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe!
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Chorus]
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
[Outro]
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
