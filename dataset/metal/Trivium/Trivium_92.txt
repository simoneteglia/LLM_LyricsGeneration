[Verse 1]
Ripping out the feelings used to
Hold me in to place
Breaking through the
Structures, I unfold at my
Disgrace
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown
[Chorus]
A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End
[Verse 2]
Swallowing the ashes of a newly
Burned-down dream
Tasting only charred remains of
Cured and better me
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown
[Chorus]
A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End
[Bridge]
I burst, not bleed
I'm pulled into the undertow
I burst, not bleed
I'm swallowed by the great below
[Solo]
[Chorus]
A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End
[Outro]
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
