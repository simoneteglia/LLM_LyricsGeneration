Within the thrill, amidst the kill
One against all, soon blood will spill
We cannot wait to make your pain
We are the burn inside your brain
Herding the weak to fire
Scorching the fleeing liars
Witness the dying saboteurs
Carcasses washed upon the shores
Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars
Burn the bridge
Take the ash
Scatter deceptiveness
We are the ones who led the way
This path to hell and misery
An endless war, a hollow cause
When we all die, we'll see no gods
Herding the weak to fire
Scorching the fleeing liars
Witness the dying saboteurs
Carcasses washed upon the shores
Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars
Burn the bridge
Take the ash
Scatter deceptiveness
I'm the source
Of your hate
Only yourself to blame
Dying
Dying once seemed so heroic to me
Giving this body for a people in need
Now I realize there is nothing to see
Nothing but dirt and decay
Decay
Decay
Dying
Dying once seemed so heroic to me
Giving this body for a people in need
Now I realize there is nothing to see
Nothing but dirt and decay
Decay
Decay
Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars
Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars
Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars
If they should take me
Then may they break me
Kill me, burn me
But I'll stay torched into the heart
Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars
Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars
If they should take me
Then may they break me
Kill me, burn me
But I'll stay torched into the heart
