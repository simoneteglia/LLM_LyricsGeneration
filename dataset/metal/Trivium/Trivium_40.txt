[Verse 1]
Disintegration constituents
To decompose of the parts (of the parts, of the parts)
A malformation: utopia
Systematic unity can't be achieved
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame
(That force you, that force you)
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)
We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)
[Chorus]
To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed
[Verse 1 Reprise]
Disintegration constituents
To decompose of the parts (of the parts, of the parts)
A malformation: utopia
Systematic unity can't be achieved
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame
(That force you, that force you)
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)
We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)
[Chorus]
To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed
[Bridge]
Behold your fellow man
Through centuries of control
Adhering to the decrees
Of a manufactured god
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Bridge]
Behold your fellow man
Through centuries of control
Adhering to the decrees
Of a manufactured god
[Solo: Heafy]
[Chorus]
To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed
To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed
