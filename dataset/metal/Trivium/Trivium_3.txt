[Verse 1]
These graves are cold and empty
He knew it's where we'd soon reside
The waves recede so gently
They only left the sands of time
[Pre-Chorus]
(What have we done?)
To the future, we run
(What have we done?)
Headlong without question
(What have we done?)
Creations devised
(What have we done?)
To put an end to all life
[Chorus]
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
[Verse 2]
These shadows sleep so soundly
Appalled, he now averts his eyes
Disgraced, he felt so empty
Entrusting us with our demise
[Pre-Chorus]
(What have we done?)
To the future, we run
(What have we done?)
Headlong without question
(What have we done?)
Creations devised
(What have we done?)
To put an end to all life
[Chorus]
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
[Post-Chorus]
Beyond oblivion
Beyond oblivion
Beyond oblivion
Beyond oblivion
Go!
Beyond oblivion
Beyond oblivion
Beyond oblivion
Beyond oblivion
[Chorus]
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits beyond oblivion
