[Verse 1]
So you think you've won
Come take a walk inside
This enraged, pissed-off mind
It's calling for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel, feel my hatred
It bleeds down
On your faith
[Verse 2]
Lusted for so long
For the moment
Lying broken in a corner
Here it comes
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel, feel my hatred
It bleeds down
On your faith
Feel, feel your ending
It's so grim and cold here
[Chorus]
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
[Verse 3]
Ancient and immortalized
Will be my hate forever
For your kind
Humankind
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel, feel my hatred
It bleeds down
On your faith
Feel, feel your ending
It's so grim and cold here
[Chorus]
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
[Outro]
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
