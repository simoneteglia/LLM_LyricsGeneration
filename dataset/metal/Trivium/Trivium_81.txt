[Verse 1]
Take me into the seas
So I can clean, off this disease
Death will complete me
It is what I need
[Pre-Chorus]
Take my evil, to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies
[Chorus]
Shattering the Skies Above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the Skies Above
I won't rest 'til I am drenched in blood
[Verse 2]
Take me into the seas
So I can clean, off this disease
Death will complete me
It is what I need
[Pre-Chorus]
Take my evil, to the skies
Take my evil, all light dies
[Chorus]
Shattering the Skies Above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the Skies Above
I won't rest 'til I am drenched in blood
