[Verse 1]
As the innocent take the punishment
That was really meant for every one of you
Claim immunity from the misery
Bark your right to be, wielding your weapons
Turned a blinded eye, as the children died
Lost within your lie, evil defines you
How can you not grieve? I cannot believe
What has come to be, the land reeks of madness
[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me
[Chorus]
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the thoughts won't stop
I cannot breathe
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the hardest part
Was to believe
[Verse 2]
It amuses me that you fail to see
What has come to be a paranoid nation
You cry "terrorist" with a pounding fist
As your kind assists those who would end us
Your version of the truth will only benefit you
If you could only view the dead all around us
You have brought it on; you're the guilty ones
Now we're running from our very extinction
[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me
[Chorus]
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the thoughts won't stop
I cannot breathe
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the hardest part
Was to believe
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel it growing inside me
(I can feel it growing inside me)
Something that I would never dare speak
(I would never dare speak)
Containing the anguish depletes me
(Depletes me)
Unleashing the anger redeems me
[Chorus]
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the thoughts won't stop
I cannot breathe
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the hardest part
Was to believe
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the thoughts won't stop
I cannot breathe
(Cannot breathe, cannot breathe)
Oh—the hardest part
Was to believe
