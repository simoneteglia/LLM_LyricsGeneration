[Verse 1]
Been down this road too many times
(Been down this road too many times)
You taught me how it feels to die
(You taught me how it feels to die)
[Pre-Chorus]
We learn what it feels like
To feel pain for the first time (for the first time)
We learn what it feels like
To suffer, feels like to suffer
[Chorus]
Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
By any length
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
[Verse 2]
I watch it fall before my eyes
(I watch it fall before my eyes)
This dream we've built for our whole lives
(This dream we've built for our whole lives)
[Pre-Chorus]
We learn what it feels like
To feel pain for the first time (for the first time)
We learn what it feels like
To suffer, feels like to suffer
[Chorus]
Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
By any length
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
[Post-Chorus]
Vanquish that which kills you, darling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
Through the world, I feel I'm falling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
[Briddge]
Ahh! Ohh!
Crest fall in on the crestfallen
Collide and collapse
[Guitar Solo]
Crest fall in on the crestfallen
Collide and collapse
[Chorus]
Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
By any length
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
[Post-Chorus]
Vanquish that which kills you, darling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
Through the world, I feel I'm falling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
[Outro]
Forsake (forsake)
Forsake (forsake)
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
Forsake (forsake)
Forsake (forsake)
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
