[Verse 1]
Explicit deviance
Don't have to hide
Display their wealth of sin right 'fore our eyes
Complicit in ruin
Protect with lies
Defenestrate, destroy
Mock and victimize
[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing to gain
Playing their games
Always the same
Corruption betrays
[Chorus]
I stand in defiance of your ways
The defiant, the defiant
Nothing can absolve you from this hate
The defiant, the defiant in your way
[Verse 2]
Explicit deviance
Don't have to hide
Display their wealth of sin right 'fore our eyes
Complicit in ruin
Protect with lies
Defenestrate, destroy
Mock and victimize
[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing to gain
Playing their games
Always the same
Corruption betrays
[Chorus]
I stand in defiance of your ways
The defiant, the defiant
Nothing can absolve you from this hate
The defiant, the defiant in your way
[Post-Chorus]
Nothing can absolve you from this hate
(This hate, this hate)
[Bridge]
I stand in defiance of your ways
Nothing can absolve you from this hate
The defiant in your way
The defiant
The defiant in your way
The defiant
The defiant in your way
[Chorus]
I stand in defiance of your ways
The defiant, the defiant
Nothing can absolve you from this hate
The defiant, the defiant in your way
