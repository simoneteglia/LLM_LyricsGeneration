[Verse 1]
You starve your children on neglect
Then feed their bellies with fear (Bellies with fear)
Concussion, bat to the brain
Witness to a battered mother (Battered mother)
[Chorus]
Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear
(No longer will your family fear)
A gunshot to head of trepidation
(Trepidation)
My promise if you ever lay a finger
[Verse 2]
Just look at the scars you make
Your terror makes your kids break (Makes your kids break)
A broken home, just as you were raised
With fists raised up to your children
[Chorus]
Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear
(No longer will your family fear)
A gunshot to head of trepidation
(Trepidation)
My promise if you ever lay a finger
[Bridge]
This battle is on all
You've made beautiful
Now hateful
You wretched life wrecker
Abuser
Now suffer
[Breakdown]
Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife, we'll strike down the hand
(Open fire, build the pyre)
If I can't make you see the damage you've made
(Open fire, build the pyre)
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Solo: Heafy]
[Refrain]
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Outro]
Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife, we'll strike down the hand
Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife, we'll strike down the hand
(Open fire, build the pyre)
If I can't make you see the damage you've made
(Open fire, build the pyre)
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive
