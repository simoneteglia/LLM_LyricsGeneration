[Verse 1]
A strain of vigilance
Deep roots that all connect
We wait so diligent
Watching you
Watching you
(Watching you)
(Watching you)
[Verse 2]
An engine of suspicion
A web you can't escape
Crossing all lines to listen
Breaking through
Breaking through
[Refrain]
Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn
Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn
[Chorus]
These
Eyes
Show
You
Bending the arc to fear
This (This)
Heart (Heart)
Will (Will)
Prove (Prove)
Bending the arc to fear
[Post-Chorus]
These
Eyes
Show
You
Bending the arc to fear
[Refrain]
Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn
(Bending the arc to fear)
[Bridge]
Prey upon you
Prey upon you
Prey upon you
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn
[Chorus]
These
Eyes
Show
You
Bending the arc to fear
This (This)
Heart (Heart)
Will (Will)
Prove (Prove)
Bending the arc to fear
Bending the arc to fear
