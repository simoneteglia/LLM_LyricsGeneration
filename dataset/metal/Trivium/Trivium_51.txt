[Verse 1]
In birth, just an ember, a spark of creation
Towards genesis
With vision of dominion and godliness
[Bridge]
With vision godliness
We will take all you have held
[Verse 2]
In evolution's design, it will burn up
All obstacles
Changing opposition to a carnal ash
[Bridge]
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred, sacred
With vision godliness
[Pre-Chorus]
Stay here
Till the windows stop burning for your dreams
Stay here
Till the windows stop burning for your...
[Chorus]
From ember to inferno
From ember to inferno
[Verse 1 Reprise]
In birth, just an ember, a spark of creation
Towards genesis
With vision of dominion and godliness
[Bridge]
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred, sacred
With vision godliness
[Pre-Chorus]
Stay here
Till the windows stop burning for your dreams
Stay here
Till the windows stop burning for your...
[Chorus]
From ember to inferno
From ember to inferno
[Refrain]
Sacred
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2 Reprise]
In evolution's design, it will burn up
All obstacles
Changing opposition to a carnal ash
[Bridge]
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred, sacred
With vision godliness
[Pre-Chorus]
Stay here
Till the windows stop burning for your dreams
Stay here
Till the windows stop burning for your...
[Outro/Chorus]
From ember to inferno
From ember to inferno
From ember to inferno...
