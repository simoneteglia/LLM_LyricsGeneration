[Verse 1]
Your face betrays your words
And those words gave way to hurt
The ground between us grows
Like wounds that never show
But the distance couldn't mend
'Cause the time ran out instead
The ground between us grows
Like wounds that never show
[Pre-Chorus]
Of father and son
Two lives now come undone
Of father and son
Too late, now all is gone
[Chorus]
So tonight
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes
[Verse 2]
Your face reveals your pain
Seconds lost, I take the blame
The cold light cuts the night
Your ashes come to life
What's left is in my hands
Will I ever understand?
The cold light cuts the night
Your ashes come to life
[Pre-Chorus]
Of father and son
Two lives now come undone
Of father and son
Too late, now all is gone
[Chorus]
So tonight
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes
[Bridge]
What's lost
We'll never know
What's lost
We'll never know
[Pre-Chorus]
Of father and son
Two lives now come undone
Of father and son
Too late, now all is gone
[Chorus]
So tonight
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes
