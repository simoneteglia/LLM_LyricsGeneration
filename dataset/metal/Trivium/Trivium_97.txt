[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Verse 1]
Swimming the river ascending
Free of fear, filled with purpose
Nishikigoi
fights through oceans of adversity
Against the current to obtain the highest goals
[Pre-Chorus]
Swim through oceans of suffering
(Swim through oceans)
[Chorus]
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from koi into a beast
Dragon
[Verse 2]
A living symbol of courage
No wave will shatter these scales (shatter these scales)
Dreams of three eagle claws and the paws of a tiger
Waterfall's up ahead; one thing left to do
[Pre-Chorus]
Swim through oceans of suffering
(Swim through oceans)
[Chorus]
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from koi into a beast
Dragon
[Breakdown]
You'll never stop the becoming, yeah
This dragon will rise and be king
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Verse 3]
All bear witness to a great form
Evolution is complete
A breath that turns into clouds producing rain or fire
Watch the world move according to each desire
[Pre-Chorus]
Swim through oceans of suffering
(Swim through oceans)
Swim through oceans of suffering
(Swim through oceans)
[Chorus]
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from koi into a beast
Dragon
[Solo: Heafy / Gregoletto]
