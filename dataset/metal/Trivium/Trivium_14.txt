[Verse 1]
The face and the lips tremble as it rips
Your breath quickening as heat rushes in
[Chorus]
Pull harder, strings, martyr
"Stop!," you cry, "That's a lie!"
Flush, gasping, white, reddening
You smile and destroy it, it's time that we end this
[Post-Chorus]
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
[Verse 2]
Clawing the skin, each kill, your weakness
Annihilation, your masturbation, tyrant, I'll burn you down
[Chorus]
Pull harder, strings, martyr
"Stop!," you cry, "That's a lie!"
Flush, gasping, white, reddening
You smile and destroy it, it's time that we end this
[Post-Chorus]
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
[Bridge]
My hands grip your throat, I need your end
Burned, staked, ripped apart, I avenge
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay
You ask me, "Oh, God, why?"
'Cause I'm God's fucking why
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Pull harder, strings, martyr
"Stop!," you cry, "That's a lie!"
Flush, gasping, white, reddening
You smile and destroy it, it's time that we end this
[Post-Chorus]
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
