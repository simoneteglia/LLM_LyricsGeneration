[Verse 1]
Wandering endlessly upon the shores
For something that I will never attain
Banished here for a life of nothingness
My only comfort is the sand I bleed on
[Pre-Chorus]
Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones
[Chorus]
Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go
[Verse 2]
I'm dying endlessly upon the shores
For something that I will never attain
Tortured here for a life of nothingness
My only comfort is the sand I die on
[Pre-Chorus]
Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones
[Chorus]
Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go
[Bridge]
Charon, is this the fate for me?
Is the obolus all I pay?
Cursed to wander the shores of Acheron
My eyes must have been missing silver coins
[Solo: Heafy]
[Bridge]
Maggots drinking the blood of me
Insects licking the tears I weep
Hornets piercing, while wasps are breaking
Every single fucking inch of skin on me
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Pre-Chorus]
Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones
[Chorus]
Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go
