[Verse 1]
The devil’s in the details
This story’s one of betrayal
[Pre-Chorus]
(Undeserving)
Ungrateful
Unworthy
You are the undeserving
(Undeserving)
No honor
No valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right
[Chorus]
You are the thing that’s killing me
You’re poisoning
You are the thing that’s killing me
Now I’m here, to bury thee
[Verse 2]
Set fire to the empire
While growing fat on this world
[Pre-Chorus]
(Undeserving)
Ungrateful
Unworthy
You are the undeserving
(Undeserving)
No honor
No valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right
[Chorus]
You are the thing that’s killing me
You’re poisoning
You are the thing that’s killing me
Now I’m here, to bury thee
[Solo]
[Bridge]
You are the thing that’s killing me
Now I can see
[Chorus]
You are the thing that’s killing me
You’re poisoning
You are the thing that’s killing me
Now I’m here, to bury thee
