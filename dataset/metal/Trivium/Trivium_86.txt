[Verse 1]
The sun beats down
Crushing me below its burning weight
Save me now
Everything is lost inside the storm
[Pre-Chorus]
I
Burn from the inside out
I
Look from the inside out
[Chorus]
I've come undone
Beneath the sun
I'm not the same
When all is lost
At any cost
Don't fade away
[Verse 2]
The sky falls down
Carving out the headstone made of sand
Take me now
Lead me from the temptations of man
[Pre-Chorus]
I
Burn from the inside out
I
Look from the inside out
[Chorus]
I've come undone
Beneath the sun
I'm not the same
When all is lost
At any cost
Don't fade away
[Solo]
[Bridge]
I'm burning inside
There's no place left to hide
The world I once knew has been turned to ashes
(Let it burn forever)
I'm burning inside
(And ever)
There's no place left to hide
On and on, the world must burn
And as the ashes, we return to dust
[Chorus]
I've come undone
Beneath the sun
I'm not the same
When all is lost
At any cost
Don't fade away
