[Verse 1]
Decomposing in this worthless tomb
Nothingness inhaled, I am consumed
Starving for the ending to this doom
We the parasite, our death overdue
[Pre-Chorus]
Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul
[Chorus]
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
[Verse 2]
Termination sits across my cell
Waiting patiently to unleash hell
Frothing at the mouth, its hunger tells
Of the feast I'll soon become, my soul melts
[Pre-Chorus]
Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul
[Chorus]
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
[Bridge]
Ahh!
Rain
Rain down
On
This hopeless
Scorched abyss
Rain down
Termination's
All we're owed
Rain down
Rain
Rain down
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul
[Pre-Chorus]
Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul
[Chorus]
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
[Outro]
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
