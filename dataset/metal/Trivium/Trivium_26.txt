[Verse 1]
I'm wearing thin, wearing out, becoming weak
Holding hands with this rope
She's my self-destructive bleeding disease
The thing that makes it hard to breathe
But if I shoved you far away
This addict just starved again, asphyxiated
[Chorus]
And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free
[Verse 2]
Lynched high above what used to be
In her gallows built for me
So I escaped, cut this noose around my
Neck, I break free to see the things you blinded me
And I shoved you far away
Now I live the life I dreamed of
You're dead to me
[Chorus]
And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free
[Bridge]
You poisoned my life
So I take this knife
And I cut you out
Cut you out
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Chorus]
And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free
[Outro]
Set me free... set me free
Set me free... set me free
Set me free... set me free
Set me free!
