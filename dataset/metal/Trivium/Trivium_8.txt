[Verse 1]
Who has the means to save us from ourselves?
To pull us from the vicious cycles feeding back again
Consume and feed, degenerate
We damage just to liberate
Bought and sold before we could even breathe
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs
[Chorus]
You’re a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
You're a catastrophe
The one who’s come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance
[Verse 2]
How far along before we fade away?
So deeply out of focus but it seems we never cared
Deflect, deny what flows inside
The poison springs internalize
Bought and sold before we could even breathe
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs
[Chorus]
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance
Never had a chance
[Refrain]
Never had a chance
[Bridge]
Who has the means to save us from ourselves?
To pull us from the vicious cycles
Feeding back again
Feeding back again
The bringer of our devastation
You stole our innocence
Bringer of our devastation
It's you, catastrophist
[Verse 3]
Consume and feed, degenerate
We damage just to liberate
Deflect, deny, what flows inside
The poison springs internalize
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs
[Chorus]
You’re a catastrophe
The one who’s come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
We never had a chance
You're a catastrophe
The one who’s come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance
Never had a chance
[Post-Chorus]
Catastrophist
Catastrophist
[Outro]
The bringer of our devastation
You stole our innocence
Bringer of our devastation
It's you, catastrophist
