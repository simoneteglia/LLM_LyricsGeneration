[Verse 1]
I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar
The color of your fear
Confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over
In me, you can confide
You say you've lost your world
You say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark
Clothe you in my hate
[Pre-Chorus]
Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers
[Chorus]
The Revanchist—his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
"Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation"
The age-old lie
Submit for salvation
[Verse 2]
I've been calling you from the twilight
I've been pushing you to the edge
The way you say my name
The poison on your tongue
The lies they tell—pay no mind
I am the only one
You never turned your back
You didn't need to see
'Cause even in the dead of night
You found your way to me
[Pre-Chorus]
Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers
[Chorus]
The Revanchist—his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
"Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation"
The age-old lie
Submit for salvation
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1 Reprise]
I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar
The color of your fear
Confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over
In me, you can confide
You say you've lost your world
You say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark
Clothe you in my hate
[Pre-Chorus]
Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers
[Chorus]
The Revanchist—his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
"Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation"
The age-old lie
He said
"Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation"
The age-old lie
[Outro]
Submit for salvation
