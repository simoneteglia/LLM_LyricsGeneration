[Verse 1]
Your kingdom built on lies
Revenge I fantasize
Take heed, all who oppose
You thought I was disposed
[Bridge]
You’ve shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are
[Pre-Chorus]
The knives are sharpening
A co-conspiracy
Poisonous treachery
My Judas lights the flame
But now you see that I
[Chorus]
Breathe in the flames
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
[Verse 2]
Your throat, an open grave
Your tongue used to deceive
With venom sinking in
Your kind will never win
[Bridge]
You’ve shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are
[Pre-Chorus]
The knives are sharpening
A co-conspiracy
Poisonous treachery
My Judas lights the flame
But now you see that I
[Chorus]
Breathe in the flames
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
Burn you down the same
[Solo]
[Chorus]
Breathe in the flames
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
The ones that build you up can burn you down the same
[Outro]
Burn you down the same
