[Intro]
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
No other
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
No other
[Verse 1]
Is there hope
To break through
All the walls
Built around you?
You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream
Dim the world
A glassy stare
Face to face now
Do you even care to try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems
[Chorus]
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
[Verse 2]
Broken mast
Shipwrecked mind
Future sinks
By design
You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream
Lost our minds
Lost our way
Face to face now
Do you even care to try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems
[Chorus]
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
[Bridge]
Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real
Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real
[Pre-Chorus/Build-up]
We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
We've lost our way in the other worlds
[Chorus]
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
