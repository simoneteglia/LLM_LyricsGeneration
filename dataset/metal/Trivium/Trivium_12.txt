[Vere 1]
Submerged in dirt, but it was never enough
To quell the fire in the back of my lungs
My bones are aching, and my head is a mess
They said to run, but I'm obsessed with the madness
[Pre-Chorus]
This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I cannot live if I can't breathe
[Chorus]
The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside
The wretchedness inside of you
The wretchedness inside of me
[Verse 2]
Consigned to hurt, but it was never enough
To bury feelings that will surely return
My heart is aching, and my God, I'm a mess
I'll never run 'cause I'm obsessed with the madness
[Pre-Chorus]
This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I cannot live if I can't breathe
[Chorus]
The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside
The wretchedness inside of you
The wretchedness inside of me
[Post-Chorus]
I cannot control, I cannot destroy
In hell, can I confide?
The wretchedness inside of you
(In hell, can I confide?)
The wretchedness inside of me
[Bridge]
How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance
How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance
Fuck you
How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance
[Bridge]
How did it come to this?
How the fuck did it come to this?
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance
[Pre-Chorus]
This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I cannot live if I can't breathe
[Chorus]
The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside
The wretchedness inside of you
The wretchedness inside of me
[Post-Chorus]
I cannot control, I cannot destroy
In hell, can I confide?
The wretchedness inside of you
In hell, can I confide?
The wretchedness inside of me
