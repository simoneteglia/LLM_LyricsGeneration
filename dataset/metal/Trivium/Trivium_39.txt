[Verse 1]
I am the Promethean
Tragic figure in this dream
Dream known as life, known as life
I bring spark into the lives
Take the molded, show them fire
Fire's the spark in their eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
My flesh is ripped at daily
It's the cross I bear
[Chorus]
I feel it tear out my insides
A pain so heavy I could collapse
I feel it just may kill me
I must brave through this storm
[Verse 2]
I am made exemplary
Lashed up by the public scene
For bearing my heart, my soul's on fire
I pull my ribs open now
Bleed my heart upon the grounds
Drink of the blood, take me in
[Pre-Chorus]
My flesh is ripped at daily
It's the cross I bear
[Chorus]
I feel it tear out my insides
A pain so heavy I could collapse
I feel it just may kill me
I must brave through this storm
[Bridge]
Chain me down, nail me up
It feels so cold on my skin
Flesh cut deep from their claws
Chew my organs out
Salivating with hate
Crown of thorns, deathly boards
Won't make me cease to be
You've turned this scapegoat into
The lion that will devour you whole
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Solo: Heafy]
[Pre-Chorus]
My flesh is ripped at daily
It's the cross I bear
My flesh is ripped at daily
It's the cross I bear
[Chorus]
I feel it tear out my insides
A pain so heavy I could collapse
I feel it just may kill me
I must brave through this storm
I feel it tear out my insides
A pain so heavy I could collapse
I feel it just may kill me
I must brave through this storm
