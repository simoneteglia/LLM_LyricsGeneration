[Verse 1]
I am outnumbered, my vision blurred
I'm absorbed by rage, the outcome turns
Bit the hand, greater man
When you wrought my wrath, your end began
You broke me down, a shattered crown
I shoveled deep and tried to drown
This attack turned life black
So I built this flame to burn you back
To burn you back
[Chorus]
We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls
[Verse 2]
I have climbed through dirt, through mud and earth
In this quest for life, I've only hurt
I lost myself and none could help
Felt unending pain, perpetual hell
Death arrived, smile contrived
He pulled me close, but I survived
This attack turned life black
Now I own this flame and burn you back
I burn you back
[Chorus]
We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From out the pyre
A new life calls
If they build it higher
We will storm their walls
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls (Vengeance falls)
[Bridge]
Vengeance falls
Vengeance falls
Vengeance falls (Vengeance falls)
Vengeance falls (Vengeance falls)
[Solo: Beaulieu]
[Verse 3]
Gathered the strength just to hold it close
Took in the spark that became my pulse
Waited so long just to make you feel
My vengeance now has become so real
[Chorus]
We start this fire
Just to burn it all (Burn it all)
From out the pyre
A new life calls (New life calls)
If they build it higher (Build it higher)
We will storm their walls (Storm their walls)
From a dark desire (Desire)
Our vengeance falls (Vengeance falls)
