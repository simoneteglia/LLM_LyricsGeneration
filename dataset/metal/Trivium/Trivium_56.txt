[Verse 1]
Second guess every word before I even speak
Like a drug, it dilutes with every hit you seek
Assembly line authenticity
Ghostwritten complicity
Who are you to tell me what to do?
[Chorus]
I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound in my mind
[Verse 2]
Run in circles once again, what do you even mean?
Dead ideas on arrival, made up your mind it seems
Overboard, what was once profound
Drowned, but plotted, lost your ground
Who are you to tell me what to do?
[Chorus]
I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound in my mind
[Guitar solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Second guess every word before I even speak
[Chorus]
I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound
I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound in my mind
