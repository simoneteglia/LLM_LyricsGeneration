[Verse 1]
I am but a fragment
The lesser part of something more
This division leaves me
Incomplete
I long for completion
To be reassembled; detached
I am the obsolete
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Those who create for
Another's need
Will never revel
They'll only bleed
[Verse 2]
Surrounding encumbrance
Coerced habitation with those
I cannot stand to be near
Ironically scathing
This life that I work so hard for
Keeps me from what I need
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Voracious packs
Only exist to feed
Off everything that
I have in me
[Chorus]
Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very long ago
So long ago
It's plain to see
So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the broken world
[Solo: Heafy | Solo: Beaulieu| Solo: Gregoletto]
[Bridge]
Descend downwards into the dark
Are you not entertained by the fall?
Only misery enthralls
All my sadness and pain on display
It's the only way you'd ever need me
The only way you would believe me
[Chorus]
Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very long ago
So long ago
(So long ago)
It's plain to see
So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the broken world
Broken world  (Broken world)
You've broken me
Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very long ago
So long ago
(So long ago)
It's plain to see
So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the broken world
