[Intro]
Bleed into me
An ounce of your empathy
Eyes lock, you can see
A ghost, an invisible city
Bleed
[Verse 1]
Bleed into me
Those feelings you're harboring
The silence says it all
Tragedy, the look before the fall
[Pre-Chorus]
Struggles and dreams mix into one
The grim rituals have only begun
No use in leaving
I'll drift off before you are gone
Before you are gone
[Chorus]
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth
Let it bleed into you
Bleed into you
[Verse 2]
Bleed into me
A bit of your apathy
Cast aside, forget me
Another disappears in the city
[Pre-Chorus]
Struggles and dreams mix into one
The grim rituals have only begun
No use in leaving
I'll drift off before you are gone
Before you are gone
[Chorus]
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth
Let it bleed into you
[Bridge]
Falling down (Falling down)
Falling down
An ounce of your empathy
Struggles and dreams
They'll drift off before you are gone (Gone, gone, gone)
(Gone, gone, gone)
(Before you are gone)
[Chorus]
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
(Tell them the truth)
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth
Let it bleed into you
Bleed into you
Bleed into you
