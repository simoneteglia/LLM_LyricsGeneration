[Verse 1]
Snow covers every path
Stumbling, no turning back
Pushing further 'til I fall
Looking up, I hear him call
[Pre-Chorus]
What's known is now lost forever
Endless shadows lead the way
[Verse 2]
No cover from the sun
Crumbling, fall one by one
Look in envy at the dead
They took pity as they said
[Pre-Chorus]
What's known is now lost forever
Endless shadows lead the way
[Chorus]
Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir
[Verse 3]
Black waters in our wake
Sinking, await our fate
Our dead future has arrived
Dark refrain, we can't deny
[Pre-Chorus]
What's known is now lost forever
Endless shadows lead the way
[Chorus]
Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir
Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir
[Bridge]
From the depths
I will rise
From the ground to the sky
From the depths
I will rise
From the ground to the sky
From the depths
I will rise
From the ground to the sky
From the depths
I will rise
From the depths
I will rise
[Chorus]
Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir
Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir
[Outro]
Snow covers every path
Stumbling, no turning back
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir
