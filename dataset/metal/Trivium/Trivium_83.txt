[Verse 1]
In time, you'll realize
That life is but a mold
[Refrain]
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
[Verse 2]
Craft it to how you see fit
Recognize powers you hold
[Refrain]
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear by the blood I have shed
[Chorus]
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have been
[Verse 3]
To achieve the victory
Is to set yourselves free
[Refrain]
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear by the blood I have shed
[Chorus]
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have...
[Breakdown]
Burning, burning
Faster, faster
Are your revolutionists
If I could collapse the masses
We'd be free to grow our wings
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1 Reprise]
In time, you'll realize
That life is but a mold
[Refrain]
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear by the blood I have shed
[Chorus]
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have...
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear by the blood I have shed
[Chorus]
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have...
[Outro]
To set yourself free
