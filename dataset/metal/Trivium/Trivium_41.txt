[Verse 1]
"I'm alive!"
"I'm alive!"
Final words of a god left drowning
Burned alive
Burned alive
Scorch the angels out from the skies
[Chorus]
Building up the walls to surround us in
From a world built on sin
Building up the strength for the release
From a world corrupted
[Verse 2]
To be unseen
With the eyes
For it's the ground that we lie on
Open wide
Open mind
Nail your mouths shut, it's this world
[Chorus]
Building up the walls to surround us in
From a world built on sin
Building up the strength for the release
From a world corrupted, corrupted
[Bridge]
Wasting lives away
Consume to filling
Only waking
For the feeding
[Breakdown]
Give me spark to light the world
Up in flames, reignite
A changing to better times
End this now
Pillars
Serpents
Make it over
Give me spark to light the world
Up in flames, reignite
A changing to better times
End this now
[Bridge]
So no more are these dreams of angels
Washed away with the tears
So no more are these dreams of angels
Washed away with the tears
[Outro]
Pillars
Serpents
Make it over
