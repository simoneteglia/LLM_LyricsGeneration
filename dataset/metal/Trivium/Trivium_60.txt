[Verse 1]
Force-feed them your ways
Dictate up a blinded swarm
Society's afraid
[Bridge]
Declaration (declaration)
Of rebellion (of rebellion)
We will not stand defeat
[Pre-Chorus]
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
[Chorus]
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder
[Verse 2]
Take all your lives back
Arson to all they create
The time is now to lead the battle
[Bridge]
Declaration (declaration)
Of rebellion (of rebellion)
We will not stand defeat
[Pre-Chorus]
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
[Chorus]
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder
[Solo: Beaulieu/Heafy]
[Pre-Chorus]
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
[Chorus]
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder
Our enemies will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder
