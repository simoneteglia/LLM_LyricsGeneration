[Verse 1]
A wreath built of withered roses
How long till it decomposes
I don't think I can make it through this life
Without you
Of all the storms I've had to weather
You were my guiding light
In our last moments spent together
I tried to help you fight
[Pre-Chorus]
I plead with sorrow
(As it swallows me down)
I'm sinking in misery
(Won't you finally let me drown?)
[Chorus]
The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design
(A wreath built of withered roses)
[Verse 2]
I curse the heavens for their thievery
You robbed me of my light
Faith is rewarded with your treachery
I've lost my will to fight
[Pre-Chorus]
I plead with sorrow
(As it swallows me down)
I'm sinking in misery
(Won't you finally let me drown?)
[Chorus]
The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design
The darkness of my mind
I seek, what will I find?
There's nothing when we die
Fear leave me behind
[Bridge]
How much longer must I face
A world imploding, falling grace?
How much longer must I face
My self-exploding, I'm erased
[Interlude]
Light becomes darkness
Light becomes darkness
[Guitar Solo]
Light becomes darkness
Light becomes darkness
(A world imploding, falling grace)
[Chorus]
The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design
The darkness of my mind
I seek, what will I find?
There's nothing when we die
Fear leave me behind
