[Verse 1]
Exaltation
Golden memories, my creation
Devastation
Pain is clarity, lamentations
Run away
So far away
I can't outrun what is coming for me
My temptations
Woken from a dream, deviations
[Pre-Chorus]
It’s all the hate
That my heart beats
Negates my sympathies
[Chorus]
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence
[Verse 2]
Exaltation
Golden memories, my creation
Devastation
Pain is clarity, lamentations
Run away
So far away
I can’t outrun what is coming for me
Divination
Forеtold prophecies, annihilation
[Pre-Chorus]
It's all the hatе
That my heart beats
Negates my sympathies
[Chorus]
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence
[Bridge]
Decay
Embrace
Serpent's coil of all our mistakes
Decay
Embrace
Serpent's coil of all our mistakes
[Chorus]
It’s like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love
It’s like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love
It’s like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love
It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence
