[Verse 1]
I fear I’ll die a forgotten man
Just a number, a grain of sand
[Pre-Chorus]
Time won’t heal
It’s running out on me
All your pain
It’s all that I can take
[Chorus]
War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I’m gone?
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting
When I am dead and gone?
Dead and gone
[Verse 2]
I hope to die with no regrets
To leave a mark no one forgets
[Pre-Chorus]
Time won’t heal
It’s running out on me
All your pain
It’s all that I can take
[Chorus]
War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I’m gone?
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting
When I am dead and gone?
Dead and gone
[Bridge]
Bearing down
Bearing down on me
(Dead and gone)
The weight of all my insecurities
Closing in
Closing in on me
The walls collapse, I’ll never be set free
[Solo]
[Refrain]
War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I’m gone?
[Chorus]
War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I’m gone?
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting
When I am dead and gone?
Dead and gone
[Outro]
Dead and gone
