[Verse 1]
Fire
Alight the new beginning
Desire
Make this life worth living
[Pre-Chorus]
Hands are shaking (Shaking)
Heart is breaking (Breaking)
It's for the taking (Taking)
Every single thing
[Chorus]
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
[Verse 2]
Fire
Cleanse the world that would hold me back
Desire
By the throat I release you, goodbye (Goodbye)
[Pre-Chorus]
Hands are shaking (Shaking)
Heart is breaking (Breaking)
It's for the taking (Taking)
Every single thing
[Chorus]
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
[Chorus]
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
[Bridge]
We start this fire
We start this fire
The way we always do
We start this fire
The way we always do
Let the flames consume
[Guitar Solo]
The way we always do
Let the flames consume
[Chorus]
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
[Chorus]
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
