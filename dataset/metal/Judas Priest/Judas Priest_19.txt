[Verse 1]
You know that life isn't set
I lead the pack I ain't no pretender
You give as good as you get
We live and die cause there's no surrender
[Refrain]
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
[Verse 2]
You know the way that I feel
If you're with me you better hold on tighter
I'm only keeping it real
That's who I am, I'm just a non-stop fighter
[Refrain]
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
[Bridge]
Run out of road
The end of the days
Not for the weak
Only the brave
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
Chasing a dream as I go higher
Playing it mean, my heart's on fire
Living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
[Outro]
I'm chasing a dream as I go higher
You know I'm playing it mean, my heart's on fire
I'm living my life, ain't no pretender
Ready to fight with no surrender
