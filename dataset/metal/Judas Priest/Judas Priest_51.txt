[Verse 1: Halford]
Get a grip on the action
Movin' heaven and earth
You gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
[Pre-Chorus: Halford]
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant that they'll never put us down
[Refrain: Halford]
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
[Verse 2: Halford]
Tough as steel, stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
[Pre-Chorus: Halford]
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant that they'll never put us down
Spit it out...
[Refrain: Halford]
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life

[Lead: K.K. & Glenn]
[Verse 3: Halford]
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
[Pre-Chorus 2: Halford]
No denying we're going against the grain
That's 'cos we're so defiant everybody scream it again...
[Refrain: Halford]
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
