[Verse 1]
Mercenary battalions
Are poised to strike us down
Terminations conquest
Upon us now full-grown
[Chorus]
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
[Verse 2]
Devastation hungers
She waits to leap to earth
Imminent liquidation
Before the grand rebirth
[Chorus]
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
[Interlude]
Sin after sin I have endured
Yet the wounds I bear are the wounds of love
[Bridge]
Frantic mindless zombies
Grab at fleeting time
Lost in cold perplexion
Waiting for the sign
Generations tremble
Clinging face to face
Helpless situation
To end the perfect race
[Verse 3]
Flashing senseless sabres
Cut us to the ground
Eager for the lifeblood
Of all who can be found
[Chorus]
Save me, my heart's open wide
Help me, no question of pride
Save me, my people have died
Total genocide
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Slice to the left, slice to the right
None to retaliate, none will fight
Chopping at the hearts, snuffing out the lives
This race departs and no one will survive
Heads to the feet, feet to the air
Souls in the soil, heavy in despair
End of all ends, bodies into dust
To greet death friends, extinction is a must
[Guitar Solo]
