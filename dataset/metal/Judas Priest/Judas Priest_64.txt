[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:54]
[Verse 1]
As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said
That I'll not see tomorrow
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
[Instrumental Break 01:40-02:11]
[Verse 2]
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street
In the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly
Had me in their vice
[Pre-Chorus]
Not begging you
I'm telling you
[Chorus]
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me
Under blood red skies
You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
Blood red skies
[Verse 3]
Through a shattered city
Watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon
For its victim of the night
[Pre-Chorus]
They're closing in
They'll never win
[Chorus]
You won't break me
You won't take me
You won't make me
Under blood red skies
You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
Blood red skies
[Bridge]
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
[Instrumental Break 04:37-05:32]
[Guitar Solo: K.K. Downing]
[Pre-Chorus 3]
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
[Chorus]
You won't break me
You won't take me
'Cause I'll fight you
Under blood red skies
You won't break me
You won't take me
'Cause I'll face you under
Blood red skies
[Outro w/ Guitar Solo: Glenn Tipton]
You'll never take me alive
I'm telling you
Hands of justice
I will stand, I will fight
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
