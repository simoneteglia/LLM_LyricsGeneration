[Verse 1]
Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
[Pre-Chorus]
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
[Chorus]
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
[Verse 2]
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliteration's everywhere
[Pre-Chorus]
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
[Chorus]
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
[Bridge]
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep, our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in, never stop, the way to be
Hold onto the lead with all your will and you'll concede, you'll find there's life
With victory on high
[Guitar Solo: Glenn Tipton]
[Bridge]
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep, our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in, never stop, the way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and you'll concede, you'll find there's life
With victory
With victory on high
[Chorus/Outro]
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning
