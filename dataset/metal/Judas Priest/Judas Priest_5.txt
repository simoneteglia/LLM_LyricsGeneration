[Verse 1]
He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He found a place in his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him, fed him by hand
[Chorus]
Yeah! I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you
[Verse 2]
Withdrawn he'd sit there
Staring into space
No sign of life would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him goodbyeâ€”and then he died
[Chorus]
Yeah! I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you
[Verse 3]
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
Yeah! I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever and ever
But I still win
[Lead: Glenn]
[Verse 4]
How many like him are there still
Who to us, all seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands, blank and lost
Is knowledge worth this bitter cost?
[Chorus]
Yeah! I've left the world behind
I am safe here in my mind
I'm free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life, I'll decide not you
[Bridge]
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for living in
[Lead: K.K.]
[Outro]
Beyond the realms of death
