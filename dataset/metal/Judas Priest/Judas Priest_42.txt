[Verse 1]
In a league of his own
A villain with no morals
Above the law and reckless
Mutating day by day
Invisible and silence
Conspiring to get power
This man will stop at nothing
To always get his way
[Chorus]
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
[Verse 2]
When you're mind in a vice
He twists and turns with terror
Keeps building up the pressure
Until you're feeling numb
[Chorus]
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
[Post-Chorus]
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
[Bridge]
The spectre creeps behind you
Shrouded by his stealth
Ignore him at your peril
He kills to heal himself
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
In the blink of an eye
He marks you with precision
Corrupting all he touches
Salvation in your soul
Scourging you in silence
As he makes his incision
The venom's taking over
This tyrant takes his toll
[Chorus]
Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
[Outro]
You'll be frozen in fright
Like the glint of his knife
Trapped inside the mind
Of the spectre
