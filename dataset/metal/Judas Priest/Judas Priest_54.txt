[Verse 1]
Hypnotize me, mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip
Light my fire with cold desire
Losing all my grip
Eat my diamonds (Eat my diamonds)
Drinking all my gin
Feast your eyes on (Feast your eyes on)
A whole lot of sin
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
[Chorus]
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
[Verse 2]
Took my dreams, and now it seems
You're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre
Stop pretending (Stop pretending)
Got me growing old
Your torment is (Your torment is)
Fit to snap my soul
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
[Chorus]
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
[Guitar solo]
[Bridge]
You took my heart and left it blown to smithereens
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh and drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed
[Verse 3]
Going under, hear the thunder
Death-defying grace
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face
Vicious talking (Vicious talking)
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised (So abused)
I'm a human sacrifice
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, you're so damn wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no, you got your claws stuck in me
You'll never let me go
[Chorus]
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
[Outro]
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
I believe you're the devil
I believe...
I can't stand it anymore
