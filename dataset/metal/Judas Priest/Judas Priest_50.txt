[Verse 1]
Wild-eyed and tight-fisted, I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating, reacting alone
[Refrain]
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt
[Chorus]
Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained-class king
[Verse 2]
Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is?
Faithless continuum, into the abyss
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief
I spit at your apathy and seducer deceit
[Chorus]
Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained-class king
[Bridge]
Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world
But by doing so, smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off
Relentless and senseless, his lust snapped like vipers
Whose fangs sank in deep to infest and decay from the core
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt
[Chorus]
Long ago when man was king
His heart was clean, now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing
So now he's just a stained-class king
[Outro]
Stained-class king
