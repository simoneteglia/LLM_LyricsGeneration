[Verse 1]
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected, subjected to all
[Chorus]
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
[Verse 2]
Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall
[Chorus]
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, bawl
Punch, crawl
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Exploding, reloading, this quest never-ending
Until I give out my last breath
[Outro]
I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling
I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin
