[Part I: Let Us Prey]
[Instrumental]
[Part II: Call for the Priest]
[Intro]
Call for the priest, I'm dying
[Verse 1]
Well, the pressure's too much, you know I peaked last night
I gotta get some a quick release
City is standing on my shoulders
My body's going piece by piece, yeah
[Verse 2]
Well I know what I want and I know where to get it
And I'm going there right away
This is one priest that I don't have to fall on
Down to my knees and pray, no
[Chorus]
When your back's to the wall come along one and all
We shall fight all the slander that's penned
It's us we shall choose let the bigoted lose
For our triumph's the means to their end
[Bridge]
With you by my side I shall ride every storm
[Verse 3]
Let the cynics drop dead in their critical head
They're wrist merchants as we all can see
Bunch of deaf ears with their columnized fears
What a shame, what a shame, oh dear me, oh
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
When your back's to the wall, come along one and all
We shall fight all the slander that's penned
It's us we shall choose let the bigoted lose
For our triumph's the means to their end
[Verse 4]
Yes I know what I want and I know where to get it
And I'm going there right away
This is one priest that I don't have to fall on
Down to my knees and pray, no
