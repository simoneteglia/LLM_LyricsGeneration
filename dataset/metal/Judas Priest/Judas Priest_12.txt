[Verse 1]
Deadly as the viper peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
[Chorus]
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
[Verse 2]
Crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles all contorted, claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert
[Chorus]
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode
Jawbreaker
[Outro]
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
