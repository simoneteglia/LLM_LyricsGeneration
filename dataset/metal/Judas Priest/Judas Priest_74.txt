[Verse 1]
I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight, I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is the chance I'm gonna take
Gonna kick out trouble and strife
[Chorus]
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
[Verse 2]
No, I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Don't seem a lot of time, not to me
So it's off with the ties, no compromise
What it takes what it's like to be free
[Chorus]
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I've grown sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young, so what's wrong?
You don't have to be old to be wise
[Verse 3]
Alright, I'm grabbin' the reins, holding the rope
Live and let live from now on
At last a free hand, no longer pre-planned
I got a will of my own
I go as I please, fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it, then I'll ask for advice
[Outro]
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
You don't have to be old to be wise
