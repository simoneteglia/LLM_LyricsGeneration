[Verse 1]
I want to tell you, hey, I think you ought to know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go
I've heard the rumors, and it seems they're coming true
You do what suits you, but then that's nothing new
[Pre-Chorus]
Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How I suffer for your love
Yeah, say what you want to say
You know that you're gotta pay
For all the times that I've cried
[Chorus]
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like
[Verse 2]
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messing 'round, practice what you preach
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, oh, we're dead, or we're alive
[Chorus]
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Don't know what I like
[Guitar solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Do what you wanna do
Oh, what you put me through
How I suffer for the love you tied on me
Say what you want to say
But you know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried
[Chorus]
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like
You bring me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Don't know what I like
