[Verse 1]
Hero of the night
Blood and thunder rushing through me
To the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
[Chorus]
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel
With a burning heart
[Verse 2]
Master of the streets
Bulletproof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall
[Chorus]
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel
With a burning heart
[Lead: K.K. & Glenn]
[Lead: K.K.]
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall
[Chorus]
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel
With a burning heart
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather Rebel
With a burning heart
[Outro]
Leather Rebel
Leather Rebel
Leather Rebel
Leather Rebel
