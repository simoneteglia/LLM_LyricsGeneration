[Verse 1]
You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
[Chorus]
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil
[Verse 2]
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
[Chorus]
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil
[Lead: Glenn]
[Verse 3]
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul until my body's on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
You're possessing me
[Chorus]
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil
[Chorus]
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your touch of evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a touch of evil
[Outro]
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch of evil
Touch
