[Verse 1]
Behold 'tis I the commander
Whose grip controls you all
Resist me not, surrender
I'll no compassion call
[Chorus]
(Tyrant) Captor of humanity
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all
(Tyrant) Hideous Destructor
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall
[Verse 2]
Your very lives are held within my fingers
I snap them and you cower down in fear
You spineless things who belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near
[Chorus]
(Tyrant) Captor of humanity
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all
(Tyrant) Hideous Destructor
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall
[Bridge]
Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since Tyrant was enthroned
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I listen not to sympathy
Whilst ruler of this land
Withdraw your feeble aches and moans
Or suffer smite from this my hand
[Chorus]
(Tyrant) Captor of humanity
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all
(Tyrant) Hideous Destructor
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since Tyrant was enthroned
[Verse 4]
My legions
faithful unto death
I'll summon to my court
And as you perish each of you
Shall scream as you are sought
[Chorus]
(Tyrant) Captor of humanity
(Tyrant) Conqueror of all
(Tyrant) Hideous Destructor
(Tyrant) Every man shall fall
