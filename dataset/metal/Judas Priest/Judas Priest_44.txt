[Verse 1]
Once I dreamed that love would come and sweep me up away
Now it seems life's passed me by, I'm still alone today
Here come the tears
Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears
[Verse 2]
All alone, no one cares, so much to give to you all out there
Take me now, in your arms, let me rest, safe from harm
Oh, I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Won't somebody love me?
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Here they come, here come the tears...
