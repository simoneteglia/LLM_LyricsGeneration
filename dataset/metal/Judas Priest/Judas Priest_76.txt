[Verse 1]
They laughed at their gods
And fought them in vain
So he turned his back on them
And left them in pain
Now here come the saints
With their banners held high
Each one of them martyrs
Quite willing to die
[Chorus]
Wake the dead, the saints are in Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell
[Verse 2]
Cover your fists
Razor your spears
It's been our possession
For 8,000 years
Fetch the scream eagles
Unleash the wild cats
Set loose the king cobras
And blood sucking bats
[Chorus]
Wake the dead, the saints are in Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell
[Bridge 1]
We are saints
In Hell
We are saints
In Hell
We're going down
Into the fire
We're going down
Into the fire
[Bridge 2]
The streets run with blood from the mass mutilation
As carnage took toll for the bell
Abattoir, abattoir, mon Dieu quelle horreur
For a time is was like second Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
[Verse 3]
The battle is over
The saints are alive
How can we all thank you
We felt so despised
[Outro]
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell...
