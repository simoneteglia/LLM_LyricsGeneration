[Verse 1]
Wrapped tight around me like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body as the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable, let rip
[Chorus]
And eat me alive
Eat me alive
[Verse 2]
Sounds like an animal, panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone and gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy that deranges every joint
I'm going to force you at gun point
[Chorus]
To eat me alive
Eat me alive
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Bound to deliver
as
you give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as the
rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum, spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
[Chorus]
So eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
[Bridge]
Eat me alive
Alive, alive, alive
[Outro]
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat me alive
Eat
