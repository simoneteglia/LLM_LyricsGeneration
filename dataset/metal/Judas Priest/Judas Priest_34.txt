[Verse 1]
Born out of hell from the depths of
Gomorrah
Purging new graves and defiling the souls
He satiates with such vile and dark horror
Omens of dread on this night of the ghouls
[Pre-Chorus]
Raising the dead up from the ground
Needs must be fed, sorceries abound
[Chorus]
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
[Verse 2]
Feeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed
Splintered the bones and regaled in his feast
Danced on the grave of the pure and the righteous
As the moonlight's expelled from the eyes of the beast
[Pre-Chorus]
Raising the dead, blasphemy reigns
Portents of dread thrives on remains
[Chorus]
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Raising the dead, cadaver consumed
Sacraments said, bodies exhumed
[Chorus]
Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing after life
[Outro]
Stealing after life
Death's his guiding light
