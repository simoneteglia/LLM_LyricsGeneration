[Verse 1]
Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"
Outside the birds begin to call
As if to summon up my leaving
[Verse 2]
It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving
Oh, please don't take it all away
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving
Oh, please don't take it all away
[Outro]
Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"
