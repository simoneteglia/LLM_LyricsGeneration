[Verse 1]
I'm hypnotized and helpless
Beneath the pale full moon
My body is your sacrifice
Your spirit's coming soon
I stare up at a squalid night
It's been so cold and smooth
Turns tender kisses into bites
As you begin to move
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You look so weak and fragile
You seem to drip and sway
But you swept me up into your arms
And carried me away
[Chorus]
I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's coming true
[Verse 2]
You led me to temptation
Delivered me to pain
I walked upon your hallowed ground
My soul is yours to gain
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your passion drains my energy
Fear starts running deep
I'm falling in slow motion
Into eternal sleep
[Chorus]
I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's coming true
[Lead: Glenn]
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Your passion drains my energy
Fear starts running deep
Falling in slow motion
Into eternal sleep
[Chorus]
I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
There's nothing I can do
I'm living bad dreams
I can't run from you
I'm living bad dreams
This nightmare's coming true
[Outro]
I'm living bad dreams
I don't want bad dreams
Living bad dreams
