[Verse 1]
Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back
[Chorus]
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
[Verse 2]
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene that's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bait the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere
[Chorus]
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I've held my licence
It came with birth
For self-reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
[Verse 3]
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill, I take my leave
[Chorus]
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
[Chorus]
Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat
[Outro]
Grinder
