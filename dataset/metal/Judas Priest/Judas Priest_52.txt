[Verse 1]
From a fireball we came
Crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all
To make our own
Let us be left alone
[Verse 2]
Lay the tasks and pay the price
Everything suffice
Crushed and bolted all we craved
After every whim
What a state we're in
Is pain better than the grave?
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Well, when we talk with other men
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger
In the cage
We begin to shake with rage
[Guitar Solo]
