The river shows no mercy
The tower looms into my view
I sense my execution's closing
With darkness all around me
The axe is ground to end my days
The raven's cry proclaims repentance
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Into the storm
I'm gonna win
Killer of sin
Saved by the traitors gate
A man betrayed for treason
I only wanted what was right
To bring a purpose by rebellion
The storm is soon arriving
And rain will wash away my blood
This walk of death will bring survival
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Ready to die
Carry the day
Bury the lie
Tear down the traitors gate
Forgive me for my sins
I meant no harm to you
So let the axe man fall
To justify what I begin
Where will you be tomorrow
Now they've removed this mortal coil
I hope and pray I bring you freedom
For
Honour,
God and country
This world can be a better place
As I ascend from my conviction
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
River of blood
Turning the tide
Cause of the flood
Destroying the traitors gate
Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Losing my head
Blunt  of the axe
Alive when I'm dead
Escape from the traitors gate
