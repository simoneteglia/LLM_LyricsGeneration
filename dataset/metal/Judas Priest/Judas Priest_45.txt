[Verse 1]
When you feel safe, when you feel warm
That's when I rise, that's when I crawl
Gliding on mist, hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss, evils abound
[Chorus]
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
[Verse 2]
Into your room, where in deep sleep
There you lie still, to you I creep
Then I descend close to your lips
Across you I bend, you smile as I sip
Now you are mine, in my control
One taste of your life and I own your soul
Softly you stir, gently you moan
Lust's in the air, wake as I groan
[Chorus]
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
(Love bites)
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love...
[Bridge]
Bites you, invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you, delights you
It drains you to white
Love bites
You knew at first sight you'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite there'd be no turning back
So come in my arms, I strike any hour
I will return to trap and devour
[Chorus]
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
(Love bites)
In the dead of night
Love bites, love bites
In the dead of night
Love bites
[Outro]
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
Love bites
