[Drum Intro]
[Verse 1]
Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
[Refrain]
He
Is
The Painkiller
This
Is
The Painkiller
[Verse 2]
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
[Refrain]
He
Is
The Painkiller
This
Is
The Painkiller
[Bridge]
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium-plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
[Lead: Tipton]
[Verse 3]
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
[Refrain + Chorus]
He
Is
The Painkiller
This
Is
The Painkiller
Wings
Of
Steel
Painkiller
Deadly
Wheels
Painkiller
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Refrain]
He
Is
The Painkiller
This
Is
The Painkiller
He
Is
The Painkiller
This
Is
The Painkiller
[Post-Chorus]
Pain
Pain
Killer
Killer
Pain
Pain
Killer

[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Can't
Stop
The Painkiller
Pain
