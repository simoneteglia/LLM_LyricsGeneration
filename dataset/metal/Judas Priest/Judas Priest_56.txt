[Verse 1]
Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowing God of Mars
Body burning bright
[Chorus]
Well, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
Yes, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
[Verse 2]
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power
[Chorus]
Well, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
I'm riding
Riding on the wind
[Guitar solo]
[Bridge]
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
Riding on the wind
[Verse 3]
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud
Screaming, demons yell
Bursting through the clouds
[Chorus]
Well, I'm riding
Riding on the wind
I'm riding
Riding on the wind
