[Verse 1]
Howling winds keep screaming around
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
[Pre-Chorus]
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
[Chorus]
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night Crawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
[Verse 2]
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers, a last resort
Homing in, its cry distorts
Terror struck, they know they're caught
[Pre-Chorus]
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
[Chorus]
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night Crawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
[Lead: K.K. & Glenn]
[Verse 3]
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear their last rites echo on the wind
[Bridge]
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
[Pre-Chorus]
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
[Chorus]
Night crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night Crawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Beware the beast in black
Night Crawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
[Outro]
He's gonna get you
Beware the beast
Night Crawler
Beware the beast
He's gonna get you
Night Crawler
Straight out of hell
Beware of the beast
