[Verse 1]
Shot down in cold blood
Didn't know my name
No one understood
So I took the blame
Where I left my mark
When the system fell
You were in my grasp
Hid behind your veil
[Chorus 1]
Bound and abused
Branded a liar
I have endured
Trial by fire
[Verse 2]
Hang me out to dry
I broke every rule
Fell right in your trap
Played me for a fool
Catch you safe and sound
Tried to make you mine
Took this holy vow
Then you crossed the line
[Chorus 2]
Bound and abused
Branded a liar
Falsely accused
Trial by firе
Committed no crime
In my innocencе
I have endured
Trial by fire
[Bridge]
Life is so cruel and unbearable
I can't let you get in my way
What I need now is a miracle
To get through the end of each day
[Chorus 3]
Burden of guilt
Branded a liar
Whipped and abused
Trial by fire
Committed no crime
In my innocence
I have endured
Trial by fire
Trial by fire
Trial by fire
