[Verse 1]
Full moon is rising
The sky is black
I heed your call I'm coming back
The road is straight cast
Wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs
[Chorus]
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
[Verse 2]
Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds
[Chorus]
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
[Verse 3]
Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last
[Chorus]
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
