[Verse]
I know you like it hot
I'd love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside you
Until the power splits your head
We're going to rock you
Until your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with the iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
We're heavy duty
We're heavy duty
So come on, let's tell the world
