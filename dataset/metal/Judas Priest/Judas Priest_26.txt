[Verse 1]
You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why I'm alive within
I can't find the words, my mind is dead
It's better by you, better than me
[Verse 2]
Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak up thoughts I've held so long inside
Tell her now I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the world's not much living for
It's better by you, better than me
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
[Chorus]
Better by you, better than me
You can tell what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you, better than me
[Verse 3]
Guess I'll have to change my way of living
Don't want to really know the way I feel
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They find my blood upon her windowsill
It's better by you, better than me
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
[Chorus]
Better by you, better than me
You can say what I only can see
You can tell what I want it to be
It's better by you, better than me
[Outro]
Better by you, better than me
You can tell what I want it to be (Better than me)
You can say what I only can see
Better by you, better than me
Better by you, better than me
You can say what I only can see (Better than me)
You can tell what I want it, what I want it, what I want it to be
