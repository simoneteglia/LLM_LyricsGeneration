[Verse 1]
Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
[Pre-Chorus]
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
[Chorus]
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
[Verse 2]
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing laser
Burning glare
[Pre-Chorus]
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
[Chorus]
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
[Post-Chorus]
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud

[Bridge]
It's coming—Meltdown
Start running—Countdown
[Chorus]
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives
[Outro]
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
Metal meltdown
