[Intro]
Ow!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
[Pre-Chorus]
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
[Chorus]
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
[Verse 2]
Bodies revving in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimming and heads are swimming as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
[Pre-Chorus]
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
[Chrous]
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
[Bridge]
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
[Chorus]
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
[Outro]
Ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the
Razing the place to the
Razing the place to the ground
