[Verse 1]
When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you
You know there are times
When I let myself wander
As I was going under
You pulled me back to earth
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie?
[Chorus]
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
[Verse 2]
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future?
Will you ever set me free?
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie?
[Chorus]
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
[Bridge]
In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me crying?
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie?
[Chorus]
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
