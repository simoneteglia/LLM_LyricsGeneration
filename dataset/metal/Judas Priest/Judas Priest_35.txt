[Verse 1]
Drawn from years of self denying
Lost in chaos before the storm
Our strength goes on prepared for mortal battle
We can settle our old scores (Our old scores)
[Verse 2]
Look to the stars and challenge all of Heaven
Resist the Devil, dare to dream
By grace of God within our hearts eternal
For our salvation is for everyone
[Chorus]
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
[Verse 3]
We'll face our foes so they can hear our voices
The land rejoices in empathy
This trial by fire will build from their attrition
It's ammunition for our enemies
[Chorus]
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
[Bridge]
Send in the valiant, fight for what you believe
Then we shall overcome, lay victory at our feet
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We bring the lights
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
[Chorus]
We're standing as one
We're carrying on
Rising from ruins
We're bringing the light
Out from the night
Rising from ruins
