[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
[Verse 1]
I took the city 'bout one A.M,
loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again,
loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
[Verse 2]
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
[Bridge]
I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming
All night long
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
The air's electric, sparking power,
loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour,
loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
[Chorus]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
[Outro]
Living after midnight
Rocking to the dawn
Loving till the morning
