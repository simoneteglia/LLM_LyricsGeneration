[Verse 1]
I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace
[Pre-Chorus]
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell
[Chorus]
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
[Verse 2]
Twisted dreams that are born from delusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power-mad freaking intent
[Pre-Chorus]
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell
[Chorus]
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
[Bridge]
I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make
[Dueling Guitar Solos]
[Pre-Chorus]
You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from Hell
Your prayers and your demons still tolling the bell
[Chorus]
Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike (Strike, strike)
Lightning to strike
[Outro]
Lightning will strike!
