[Verse 1]
Man-eating momma, steam-driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messing, all-in wrestling
Is one of her pride and joys
She's a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two-faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
[Chorus]
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline
[Chorus]
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka Rolla woman for a Rocka Rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her you can
[Chorus repeats as the song fades]
