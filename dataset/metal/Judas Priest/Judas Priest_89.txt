[Verse 1]
When I'm far away
And I can't get through
Wherever I roam this piece of home
Keeps bringing me back to you
Holding on to hope
There's no need to fear
Wherever I roam this piece of home
Keeps telling you that I'm near
[Chorus]
So, lift up your heart
'Cause the brave will always come through
While we're apart
We will raise the red, white and blue
[Verse 2]
When I stand alone
Without you by my side
I think of all that you stand for
It fills me up with pride
Reaching out to you
'Cross mountains, sea and sky
I think of all that you stand for
And hope will never die
[Chorus]
So, lift up your heart
'Cause the brave will always come through
While we're apart
We will raise the red, white and blue
This red, white and blue
[Verse 3]
Now I'm coming home again
I'm coming home to you
And as I roam this piece of home
Has brought me back to you
[Chorus]
So, lift up your heart
'Cause the brave will always come through
While we're apart
We will raise the red, white and blue
[Outro]
So lift up your heart
'Cause the brave will always come through
And as I roam this piece of home
Has brought me back to you
