[Verse 1]
I'd spend my days alone, I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there
Like I was in a cell, a captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control
[Verse 2]
Down on the streets below, bright city lights would glow
The energy would rise
And through the heat, I'd gaze, still counting empty days
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break this spell?
[Chorus]
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
[Verse 3]
Then one night as I walked, I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance, our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar
Oh, how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this
[Chorus]
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
[Guitar solo]
[Bridge]
So destiny has bought us, oh, so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream, at last, I'll be with you forever
And all at once, it feels so right
[Chorus]
Fever, you set my soul on fire
Fever, you fill me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
[Outro]
Fever, oh, you set my soul on fire
Fever, filled me with desire
Fever, you always get it right
Fever, all day and all night
