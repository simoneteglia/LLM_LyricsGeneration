[Verse 1]
Solar winds are blowing
Neutron star controlling
All is lost, doomed and tossed, at what cost forever
[Verse 2]
Meteors fly around me
Comets die, and then they
And then they, you wanna see how they try to surround me
I can say, here today, we shall stay forever
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
If you want to find us in a hurry
Oh let me tell you don't you worry
I can't say, here today, we shall stay forever
