[Verse 1]
Feeling like we're ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, my body's aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof
Megaton, Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof
[Chorus]
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Ooh, delivering the goods
[Verse 2]
Shake down, rock them boys, crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rate, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good
We're going to load you with our brand
[Chorus]
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Oh, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Have it your way
Stealing your hearts
Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is
Bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
You're nothing more than yellow
Going to do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You got to learn your lesson
Because there ain't nobody here to defend your heart
[Verse 3]
Faster, higher, until it seems that we're going to break
Ohh, shooting further, giving more than you're ever going to take
Leaving your heads, crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more
[Chorus]
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Oh, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods
