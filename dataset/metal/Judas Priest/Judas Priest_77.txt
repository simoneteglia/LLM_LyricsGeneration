[Verse 1]
I've been trying
There's no denying
It's sending me out of my mind
I've seen reason
Change to treason
It's losing its sense of all kind
[Pre-Chorus]
How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be
[Chorus]
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
[Verse 2]
In the night time
Wake in fright
I'm so scared of the game that's being played
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals have been made
[Pre-Chorus]
How much longer will it take for the world to see?
We should learn to live and simply let it be
[Chorus]
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus]
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
Bloodstone
[Outro]
Bloodstone (I can't take it)
Bloodstone (You got me living on a)
Bloodstone (I don't want that)
Bloodstone
