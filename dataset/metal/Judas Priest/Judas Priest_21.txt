[Verse 1]
You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In London Town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
[Verse 2]
I smile when I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
[Refrain]
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the Ripper
[Verse 3]
You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if I'm near
I'm sly and I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for "the Ripper"
Or, if you like, "Jack the Knife"
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Any back-alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream at the sight
[Refrain]
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the Ripper
[Outro]
The Ripper
The Ripper
