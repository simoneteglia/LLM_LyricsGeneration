[Verse 1]
Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
[Refrain]
The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol
[Verse 2]
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fists flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory-bound
[Refrain]
The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol
[Bridge]
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Going to go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll
paratamize
you
[Guitar Solo: K.K. Downing]
[Guitar Solo: Glenn Tipton]
[Verse 3]
Chrome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs
[Refrain]
The Hell Patrol
The Hell Patrol
