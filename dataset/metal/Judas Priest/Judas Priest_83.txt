[Verse 1]
I never give true answers, I never tell no lies
I never walk a straight line, so never get surprised
I don't ask no favors, so don't get abused
I learned to win when I was young
So I'm never ever going to lose
[Chorus]
They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
[Verse 2]
I never ask no questions, I never speak my mind
I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive
I take care of business, it takes care of me
I look after myself and do it well
Because somebody's always looking for me
[Chorus]
They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
[Bridge]
What manner of man am I?
A gun, lump sum and then I move on
What manner of man are you?
Stab a friend's back to jump a queue
I do what I do because I can't do nothing better
You do what you do, just defending yourself
Because you got nothing better to do
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I got no face, no name, I'm just a killing machine
I cut the population down, if you know what I mean
I never stop in one place, I move about the cities
Got expensive tastes, but I hasten to add that
I'm the best that there is
[Chorus]
They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
[Outro]
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you
