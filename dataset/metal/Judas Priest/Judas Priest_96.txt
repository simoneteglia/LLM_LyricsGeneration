[Verse 1]
I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow
I saw a searing flash of light erupt and skyward go
I staggered back in dazed surprise, what was it I had seen?
And as I stood there mesmerized, I heard my spirit scream...
[Chorus]
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
[Verse 2]
This is the first of more to come in carefully planned attacks
If it is so we must prepare defenses to fight back
The call is out throughout the world, united we must stand
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man
[Chorus]
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
[Bridge]
When they come to take control
Every man must play his role
They won't take our world away
When the children we leave will have to believe in today
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
We warn you now, you things out there, whatever you may send
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end
With vigilance by day and night, our scanners trace the sky
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by
[Chorus]
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
[Outro]
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader, invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh
Invader, invader nearby
Invader
