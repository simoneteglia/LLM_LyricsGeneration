[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Here they come
These Gods of steel
Megatron
Devouring what's concealed
Speed of death
Cross fired they stare
Final breath
From vaporizing glares
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Raised to man oppressed
Sign of persecution
[Chorus 1]
Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
[Verse 2]
All incensed
To overthrow
Strong defense
With armaments they grow
By this quest
Their fate's renowned
Put to rest
Abominations grow
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Time to ram it down
Judgment for the tyrant
[Chorus 1]
Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
[Post-Chorus]
Fight undying and eternal
Wheels bring death and pain infernal
Honor bound your strength repleted
To no end they're undefeated
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Hellrider, Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider, Hellrider
You brought them through their despair
Hellrider, Hellrider
Your tempered steel relinquished
Hellrider, Hellrider
You slaught them all extinguished
[Verse 3]
Wrath of doom
In killing fields
They consume
Their valiants never yield
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Triumph to the Gods
Vanquished of enslavers
[Chorus 2]
Hellrider
Breaking their will
Hellrider
In for the kill
[Outro]
Hellrider, Hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider, Hellrider
You brought them through it all
Hellrider!
