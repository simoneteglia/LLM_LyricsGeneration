[Intro]
Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
[Lead: Glenn]
[Intro + Verse 1]
Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
[Chorus]
All
Guns
All guns blazing
All
Guns
All guns blazing
[Verse 2]
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two-fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
[Chorus]
All
Guns
All guns blazing
All
Guns
All guns blazing
[Lead: Glenn]
[Verse 3]
Cross-cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone-crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings
that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage
[Chorus]
All
Guns
All guns blazing
All
Guns
All guns blazing
All
Guns
All guns blazing
All
Guns
All guns blazing
[Lead: Glenn]
