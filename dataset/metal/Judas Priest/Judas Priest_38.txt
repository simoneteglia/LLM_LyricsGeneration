[Verse 1]
Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes
[Chorus]
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
[Verse 2]
Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground
[Chorus]
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
[Verse 3]
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
[Guitar Solo]
There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
[Chorus]
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
