[Verse 1]
In the last rays of the setting sun and the past days, yeah
That's where our memories run
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
[Chorus]
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's nowhere to go
[Verse 2]
Call me and I'll wait until summer, you never understood
That I'll wait forever for love that's only good
[Pre-Chorus 2]
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
[Chorus]
When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
[Bridge]
Oh, no, you won't be there tomorrow
Oh, no, say, it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh, can't you see my heart is broken in two?
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm shattered inside to find
[Chorus]
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
