[Verse 1]
You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes, he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
[Pre-Chorus]
Blinding lights, flashing colors
Sleepless nights
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
[Chorus]
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
[Verse 2]
The power-mad freaks are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
They'll slice your word to bits like a knife
[Pre-Chorus]
One last day, burning hell fire
You're blown away
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
[Chorus]
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
[Bridge]
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
[Chorus]
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
Some heads are gonna roll
[Outro]
No, no
No, no
No, no
No
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no (Heads are gonna roll)
No, no (Heads are gonna roll)
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no (Heads are gonna roll)
No
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no (Heads are gonna roll)
No, no (Heads are gonna roll)
Some heads are gonna roll
No, no (Heads are gonna roll)
