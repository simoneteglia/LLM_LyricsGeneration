[Verse 1]
Hey, I am the voice of your anger
Hey, I am the voice of your pain
Hey, I crave the feeling of danger
Hey, I am the one with no name
[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
[Chorus]
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
[Verse 2]
They don't know the way that I'm feeling
They don't know the depth of my rage
I am like the wolf that is prowling
Hey, I won't be found in a cage
[Pre-Chorus]
Out in the wilderness
Out in the cold
Out in the wilderness
Lone wolf's calling
[Chorus]
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
[Bridge]
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
[Chorus]
Out in the wild, all on my own
Leading me out of the cold
Out in the wild, all on my own
But leading me out of the cold
[Outro]
Lone wolf walks beside me
He feels no fear or pain
Lone wolf is there to guide me
From death to life again
