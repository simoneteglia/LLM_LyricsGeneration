[Verse 1]
I heard a human voice who sang like no one else
I heard a proud lady singing loud
Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn
But soon she found she was underground and wasted
I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage
Her body shook oh, she did her stuff
She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much
If you take the smooth you got to take the rough
[Chorus]
Why do you have to die to be a hero?
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid?
[Verse 2]
I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd
I felt the sound shower around
And he would take you with him where no music's been before
As you merged the power surge together
His music knew no limits if you were in its wake
You had no choice, no, but hear its voice
And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream
But once so strong survive or become weak
[Chorus]
Why do you have to die to be a hero?
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid?
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds
[Verse 3]
I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame
But fast car users lose
That legend's born from death and that is such a shame
Because every year new ones appear
[Chorus]
Why do you have to die to be a hero?
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid?
[Guitar Solo]
