[Verse 1]
With weapons drawn we claim the future
Invincible through every storm
Bring in the foe to be defeated
To pulverize from dusk till dawn
[Chorus]
Firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
[Verse 2]
The die is cast, make no exceptions
We're forged by evil to compel
Come rally round this lack of freedom
Our union thrives, so go to Hell
[Chorus]
Firepower
Taking lives
Firepower
Neutralize
[Bridge]
Empty the chamber
Lock and reload
This world thrives on danger
It's bound to explode
[Verse 3]
Aim for the target
With laser red lights
Releasing the trigger
Puts victory in sight
[Verse 3]
No time to pray or ask forgiveness
Those blessed souls are now deceased
There is no sense in this contrition
With open arms we fight for peace
[Chorus]
We fight with firepower
Petrifies
Firepower
Between the eyes
Firepower
Mortifies
Firepower
Man's demise
