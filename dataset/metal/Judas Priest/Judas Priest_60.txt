[Intro]
Valhalla
[Verse 1]
Fierce is the gale of the North Sea
We drink and rejoice from the chalice
Holding the course through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice
[Pre-Chorus]
Toe the line, keep it fine
Every man seeks this end
[Chorus]
Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belong
[Verse 2]
We crash o’er the waves
Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray on the storm’s maul
Then lightning reveals for what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard its landfall
[Pre-Chorus]
Life from death, combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain
[Chorus]
Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belong
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
The storm in the night
Takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore
Halls of Valhalla
Halls of Valhalla
Halls of Valhalla
Halls of Valhalla
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Toe the line, keep it fine
Every man seeks this end
[Outro]
The halls of Valhalla, are calling me home
The halls of Valhalla, that's where we belong
Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, I belong
