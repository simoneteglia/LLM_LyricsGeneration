Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's nothing left for you to prove
You get a chance then now's the time to move
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, incinerate by the flame thrower
No remedy so be afraid
It's cutting deep just like the razor blade
No escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Rays of redemption
Fall from the sky
Into the maelstrom
Blink of an eye
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, annihilate by the flame thrower
Immolate the bodies
No one will be saved
Consecrate with fire
Ashes fill the grave
Look to the sky and face the sun
You better try to race against the gun
There's no escape, you're in a spell
Don't you believe you stand a chance in hell
Nothing to rival
This heavy load
Pray for survival
End of the road
You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower
Sealing your fate, terminate by the flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
Flame thrower
