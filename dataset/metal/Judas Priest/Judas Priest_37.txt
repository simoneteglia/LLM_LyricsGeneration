[Verse 1]
Sun sets on the nations
World's in her disguise
Pray for all that matters
Saviour in my eyes
[Chorus]
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
[Verse 2]
Eden has been wasted
Deadly poison fills the air
Kneel down in forgiveness
While there's still time, if you care
[Chorus]
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
[Bridge]
I couldn't dream
To be without her kind
They wouldn't let her be
Or heal what she defiled
You are the hate that beats mankind
Torturous lies that lead the blind
Squandered the truth from all we said
You are the reason I feel dead
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Mountains start to crumble
Tumble in the sea
[Chorus]
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
Children of the sun
Dying one by one
