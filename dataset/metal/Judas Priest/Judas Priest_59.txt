[Verse 1]
Look around
They're movin' in
Hold the ground
When they begin
[Refrain]
We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
[Chorus]
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
[Verse 2]
So give me hope
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
[Refrain]
We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try it
But they'll never get near
And they can get out of here
[Pre-Chorus]
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
[Chorus]
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
[Bridge]
So give me hope
[Chorus]
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United, united, united we stand
United we stand one and all
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United...
