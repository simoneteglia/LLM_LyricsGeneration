[Verse 1]
Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
[Verse 2]
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpetbaggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
[Verse 3]
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair
