[Verse 1]
Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
[Chorus]
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the hammer and the anvil
[Verse 2]
Force rises
False rituals
Baptizes
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (Confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate
[Chorus]
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Between the hammer and the anvil
[Lead: K.K.]
[Lead: Glenn]
[Verse 3]
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
[Chorus]
The burning sermons consecrate their sins
Between the hammer and the anvil
Between the hammer and the anvil
[Outro]
Between the hammer and the anvil
Between the hammer and the anvil
Storm warning
But there's no fear
