[Intro: Ghostemane]
(No, no, no, no!)
[Verse: Ghostemane]
Fuck love, I don't want none, I don't want love
I'll be blunt, I'm a time bomb
(Tick, tick, tick, tick)
You say I'm a God, but I know I'm not
Why do I feel like (Nothing)?
Literally a million other reasons I gotta pretend I'm okay
But I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, not!
What you want, bitch? I'm nothin' but a notch
I went diggin' through my lungs, and it's all I really got
When am I gonna learn to give it all up?
(Nobody wants you, nobody wants you)
When am I gonna learn there's never gonna be a forever for me
A letter from me delivered to me?
Teaming up with demons instead of trying to defeat them
Looking shawty in the eyes, sayin', "Take it or leave it"
I'ma keep it under wraps that I rap
Maybe then she won't become a demon either
And we can live in another reality
Count on me to fuck it up, fuck it up
Never not the case, level eleven mage, I got it all made
Shouldn't I be happy? Shouldn't I be?
[Bridge: Ghostemane]
Help
I'm not fucking God
I'm not fucking happy, I'm never happy
No
[Outro: Ghostemane]
I was fifteen, following my dreams, holes in my jeans
Daddy hated everything but his pills
Got his thrills with his finger in my face, in my face
Then he'd say, "What a waste, what a waste, what a waste"
What a waste! What a waste!
What a waste! What a waste!
What a waste! What a waste!
What a waste! What a waste!
What a waste!
What a waste!
What a waste!
(Hahahaha)
