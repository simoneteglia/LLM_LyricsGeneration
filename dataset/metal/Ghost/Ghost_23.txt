[Intro: Nicole Zymek]
Honorable C.N.O.T.E
Yeah, Trisha, I wanna show you some of this damage
It's pretty hard to miss
Considering it's front and center on this red Ferrari
You can see the 14 very clearly on the front hood
That suspect also put in 1400 on the side door
Before going on to the BMW over there
He also wrote 1400 on the other side of this orange Aston Martin
Before going on to a second Ferrari at the back of the lot
[Chorus: Trippie Redd &
Quavo

Pull up in a Ghost, big body Ghost
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost
Pulled up in a Ghost, big body Ghost
Casper, that's a ghost, Danny Phantom ghost
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost
Bitch, I'm going ghost, bitch, I'm going ghost
(Yeah, Huncho)
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Suicide body, bitch, I'm going ghost (Skrrt, skrrt)
This the realest shit that Huncho never wrote (Huncho)
Iced out the team, now the gang froze (Ice)
Drippin' in that water like I came with Boat (Drippin')
Take me to the trap, I bet I'll find a stove (Find a stove)
Shoot 'em in the head, I bet I'll make a ghost (Bow, bow)
She do so much coco, she can't find her nose (Coco)
All my partners dead, yeah, them C-notes (C-notes, skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up on a Addy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Came up in the addy (Skrrt, skrrt)
The coupe like a dragon (Woah)
Young nigga toe-taggin' (Toe-tag)
Put 'em in a casket
With a icy medallion (Icy medallion)
Turn him to ashes, make him a genie like it's Aladdin (Huncho)

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God]
I'm like "Hola" like I'm Dora
I'm not Spanish, in that pussy I explore her (Cold as ice)
Minnesota, caught her daughter, suck my dick and throw up (Caught, caught)
Me and Trippie throwing up the 4s up (Throw it up)
Tell my nigga Gio like "Roll Up" (Roll Up)
Cold out, snow out, .44s out (Cold)
Hanging out the van with the pistols (Cold)
I'ma make you pop it like Cristal (Okay)
Okay, I just lost my dawg, Adventure Time (Wet)
Message to his killer, I'm gon' find (Wet)
I'ma carry on your message
Bring the whites and blacks together like the paint on mime
Okay move, you gotta move (Yuh)
Just like a Austin Power movie, bitch, I think that I got groove (Just like a)
Just like a Thriller and I'm Michael Jackson, bitch, I think I'm smooth

She gon' do what it do (Water), give me that neck right in a pool (Pool)

Bitch, I'm going ghost, huh
Let a pussy nigga try me like I'm DeJ Loaf, huh
Suck my dick, yes, my body so insane, I know, uh
Bring that back, I'ma swing and let a nigga know, ayy
Just like the Knicks, play with my balls
Play with my dick, wear out your walls
Just like a gnome, I'm at your home
Right on your yard, pulling your card
My bitch big body, look like the president
You cannot rap, you are irrelevant
I'm just beginning just like I'm Genesis
She wanna fuck 'cause I got melanin, ayy
[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Pull up in a Ghost, big body Ghost
