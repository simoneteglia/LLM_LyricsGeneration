[Intro]
Boy you should know that
I've got you on my mind
Your secret admirer
I've been watching you
[Chorus]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovin' strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong gonna give my all to you
[Verse 1]
Every day I pray my heart can win
Every night I pray I can call you my man (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need you, I want you, to have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out every weekend just to see my boo again
[Chorus]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong gonna give my all to you
[Verse 2]
These feelings I have for you can go deeper if you can come
Correct with your game boy (No, no), no, you can't be lame, boy
But if you can please me then my love will come easy
I'll do anything you want, freak me boy, I'm thinking of you
[Chorus]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovin' strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you
[Bridge]
Boy you've got all I need from what I see
And boy every night I am constantly thinking of you
[Chorus]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovin' strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovein' strong, gonna give my all to you
[Outro]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovin' strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on give me a call, boo
If your lovein' strong, gonna give my all to you
