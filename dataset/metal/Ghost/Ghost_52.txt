[Intro: Louis Farrakhan]
So, all you scared to death negros
Just sit down
Don't you come out to defend our enemy
You sit down and you shut up
And tell your master to come on out and deal with this
[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Next time they bring up the Gods, you gon' respect us
That lil' vest ain't gonna do you, I shoot from neck up
I ain't even tryna hold ya, Magnolia Slim
I'm a soldier from that mode, I'm the ghost of him
From the era of police stretcher, no cameras catch it
Drop you off in a rival hood, you rather be arrested
If you didn't have no straps, you couldn't wear your necklace
Niggas hand around your throat, that's a choker reference
My ancestors took old food, made soul food
Jim Crow's a troll too, he stole the soul music
That's the blood that goes through me, so you assumin'
I could never sell my soul, they sold they soul to me
Peaceful teaching of Rumi, but don't confuse me
You mouth off for the cameras, I make a silent movie
Now here's some jewelry
No civilization is conquered from the outside until it destroys itself from within
Pen, put a pin in that, will come back when I fin
You can't talk like I talk 'cause you ain't been where I been, young
[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
If it come from me and Hov, consider it Qur'an
If it come from any of those, consider it Harām
The minaret that Jigga built me on the Dome of the Roc
Was crafted, so beautifully, consider this Adhan
From a hard place and a rock to the Roc Nation of Islam
I emerged on the wave that Tidal made to drop bombs
I came to bang with the scholars
And I bet you a Rothschild I get a bang for my dollar
The synagogue of Satan want me to hang by my collar
But all praise due to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala
I put on for my nation like I'm King T'Challa
Crushing the oyibo that try to bring wahala
You want it, I got it
Don't make me have to blast this rocket, uh
Jay Electricity
The thing he need like a whole in his head is publicity
Though he shine like a Christmas tree
Verily, verily, I tread through life merrily
Giving all thanks to God for this universal therapy
[Outro: JAY-Z]
Think of things I said that you hated then
Empirical facts that can't be debated now
Things you say today, I was sayin' then
Tell us who your favorite now
