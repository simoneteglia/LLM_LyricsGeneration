[Intro: Reporter]
This is the type of music believed to be responsible for a wave of attacks on churches in northern Europe
It’s avertedly anti-christian, and synonymous with Satanic worship
This church in Bergen, Norway was burnt to the ground
[Verse 1]
I never get no sleep how my money all spent
But one day I'ma die and it won't mean shit
I'm sick of seein' kids tryin' to rap like this
Take that band tee off you don't listen to that shit
Bitch I'm an introverted, inverted cross reppin'
Mothafucker, go bump please leave me alone
Black metal bumpin'
Out my whip I'm gettin' in touch with Lucifer again
I was doin' fine but now I think I'm givin' into temptation
Mane
I don't work a job no more
I don't hate life no more
JK really just wanna croak
Granny find me dead on the floor
But I won't overdose
I don't pop pills like you
Speakin' to Hermes alone
You’ll know what I mean, you lost
[Chorus]
Friday, I'ma trip all day (Friday, I'ma trip all day)
Saturday, I'ma drink all day (Saturday, I'ma drink all day)
Sunday, I'ma post up at the church (Sunday, I'ma post up at the church)
Burn it down, Yung Varg, I'm cursed (Burn it down, Yung Varg, I'm cursed)
Friday, I'ma trip all day (Friday, I'ma trip all day)
Saturday, I'ma drink all day (Saturday, I'ma drink all day)
Sunday, I'ma post up at the church (Sunday, I'ma post up at the church)
Burn it down, Yung Varg, I'm cursed (Yung Varg, I'm cursed)
[Verse 2]
I forgot how to smile, can somebody show me?
Then again I never knew I just put on a show
Ayy, I can not recall a time that I did not wanna keep my face under the surface of acid
Fillin' up my bathtub and dissolvin' in it until I am bone
(I don't know what life is without a constant)
(Feelin' that I'm bein' held down under the water)
You a big shot now you think you Satan’s son, huh?
Until you see him face to face and then he drag you under
[Chorus]
Friday, I'ma trip all day (Friday, I'ma trip all day)
Saturday, I'ma drink all day (Saturday, I'ma drink all day)
Sunday, I'ma post up at the church (Sunday, I'ma post up at the church)
Burn it down, Yung Varg, I'm cursed (Burn it down, Yung Varg, I'm cursed)
Friday, I'ma trip all day (Friday, I'ma trip all day)
Saturday, I'ma drink all day (Saturday, I'ma drink all day)
Sunday, I'ma post up at the church (Sunday, I'ma post up at the church)
Burn it down, Yung Varg, I'm cursed (Yung Varg, I'm cursed)
