[Verse 1: Yung Plague]
Creeping up out the dungeon
Bitch, all it look like is fungus
Pentagram, bitch, got the hunnid
All of this weed, I be crumbling, now smoking
The roaches approaching the hopeless and roping
The bitches like roses and then I start stomping
Roping the bone, better watch your step
Toting the TEC, throw that shade at your neck
Schema boys
, $uicide throw up the set
I'm unleashing the evil from under my bed
Killing myself with the noose or the knife
Bitch, I'm through with my life, yeah, I'd rather be dead
Let the demons arise, let them enter my head
Grey in my eyes
, but they leave something red
Piercing the crucifix deep in my chest
Leaving a mess for the bugs to infest
[Verse 2: Lil Remains]
Smoking my dope to the dome
King of heroin and euphoria clutching my brain
Look in the mirror then I fucking figure
I'm Lucifer running around changing the game
Changing the pages of history, bitch
Fuck the Bible, I'm rolling it up in a swisher
Fuck off my liver, it shivers and quivers
I'm popping pain pills like I'm popping the trigger
The
Hitler
of the $uicide cult that follows
Bottles I swallow with scripts no regard for a tomorrow
Soaking in sorrow the $carecrow has risen off the post
The muddy coast, sipping codeine 'til I overdose
[Verse 3: Ghostemane]
All I think about is putting a hole in my brain
Never wanna deal with another thing
That don't got a thing to do with levitating to the plane
It started with a bang, ended with me
Face down on a bloody carpet and now I'm lookin' down at me
I never thought that I'd be thinking the way I been
Predicaments, in a pickle, whatever you wanna say
I know what you wanna say
You wanna say, ''It'll be okay one day''
I'ma roll the dice and bet 7 on death
Don't fear the reaper, he's coming to siphon the life from your chest
Say that you wishing to die
But you wishing to get more attention, but bitch, now you next
Puffing that Bible swish with $lick
While watching you die and I'm sipping my liq'
Soon as the bottle is done, commit
Seppuku
, I'm out of this
[Chorus: JGRXXN]
Commit
Schemacide
with Seppuku, it's your fate
I hope you die slow from the puncture of the blade
If you got no nuts to do it yourself then it's okay
I got the red beam and it's aiming at your face
Commit
Schemacide
with Seppuku, it's your fate
I hope you die slow from the puncture of the blade
If you got no nuts to do it yourself then it's okay
I got the red beam and it's aiming at your face
