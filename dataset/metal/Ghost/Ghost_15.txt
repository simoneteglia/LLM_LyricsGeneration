[Intro]
Uh, ayy
Fuck 'em
Yeah
Ayy, keep that shit goin' mane
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, yuh, ayy, ayy
[Chorus]
All these punk motherfuckers don't know (Don't know)
They running their mouth like I won't kick in their door (Like I won't kick in they door)
All these punk motherfuckers hitting my phone (Hitting my phone, ayy)
You think we boys, I never seen you at one of my shows (I never seen you at one of my shows)
All these punk motherfuckers don't know (Don't know)
They running their mouth like I won't kick in their door (Like I won't kick in they door)
All these punk motherfuckers hitting my phone (Hitting my phone, ayy)
You think we boys, I never seen you at one of my shows (I never seen you at one of my shows)
[Verse]
See, I been fucking up my life no joke (No joke)
Tatted my face, quit my job, went broke (Went broke)
But I been loving every day a little more (Day a little more)
When you hear that wooden block, you know it's only Ghoste
Made in the image of what they call Satan
The blade is serrated and decapitating
The brain of sedated and awaiting heads
Never to let them think freely again
Put 'em in an underwater grave
Better pay your attention to what I am about to say
Fuck what your friends say
Fuck what the man say
I been licking venom off my gums (Ayy, yuh)
Getting faded off the blood of my girl, (Yuh, yuh)
I cut her on the face, she told me "more" (Ayy, yuh)
She got blood on my grandma floor (Ayy, yuh)
Bitch, I'm draped in Ghost Supply head to toe (Ayy, yuh)
Y'all were sleeping, I don't want your damn clothes (Ayy, yuh, yuh)
My chick gon' to seduce your damn girl (Ayy, yuh)
We tag-teaming like we wrestling for the belt
(Lay down your soul)
[Chorus]
All these punk motherfuckers don't know (Don't know)
They running their mouth like I won't kick in their door (Like I won't kick in they door)
All these punk motherfuckers hitting my phone (Hitting my phone, ayy)
You think we boys, I never seen you at one of my shows (I never seen you at one of my shows)
All these punk motherfuckers don't know (Don't know)
They running their mouth like I won't kick in their door (Like I won't kick in they door)
All these punk motherfuckers hitting my phone (Hitting my phone, ayy)
You think we boys, I never seen you at one of my shows (I never seen you at one of my shows)
