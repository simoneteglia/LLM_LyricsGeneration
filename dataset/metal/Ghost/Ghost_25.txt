[Verse 1]
I've been in a rut, ducked off from the sun
Bit my gun with my black gold gums
I'm no fun, I'm no fun
Blood run marathons down my chest (Down my chest!)
I'm a mess, ain't nobody gonna clean up
Bulletproof your
limousine
I been in the market for a brand new soul
Daddy hit a brand new low
Better yet, another agoraphobic episode
Here we go again, here we go again, here we go
Cut me up to little pieces like you're Ed Poe
Let me rest in pieces underneath the floorboards
Planet on fire, no fucks given
I'ma let us all die, let us all die, really, I
[Refrain]
I haven't been good to myself
And you haven't been good to me
I haven't been good to myself
And lately, you haven't been good to me
[Verse 2]
Lately, I decided I'ma stay alive
I just wanna live and see society die
Looking around and all I see is at the end of the line
I see a dystopia, dystopia!
Evil all over and no one is (Safe)
Nihilist, I am the finest, though I don't align with it
(We're all to blame)
Keep on denying it!
You think that I need you
I'll show you I'm fine
[Segue]
You think that I need you?
You think that I need you?
You think that I need you?
You think that I need you!?
[Chorus]
You think that I need you (Need you!)
I'll show you I'm fine (I'm fine!)
[Interlude]
What happens when you cut out the circuitry?
The chips, machinesâ€”what's left?
Flesh. We're vulnerable, fragile, weak
