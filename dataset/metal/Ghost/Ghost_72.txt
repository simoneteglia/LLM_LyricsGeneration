[Verse]
I used to have a bitch, now she ain't shit
I burned that black track jacket that I ate her in
I copped a new one 'cause I finally got a little ends
Just leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, I'm tryin' not to sin
I'm tryin' to find a way up out of this fucking rut I'm in
I thought about taking my life on Periscope but thought again
I'm reading shit from kids that tell me they just want to quit
You're not alone, not alone, I feel like dying
I'm waking up alone and trying to find a reason why
To get up out my sheets and go on outside and feel daylight
Please tell me why I'm feelin' this way all the sudden, I was so fine
But what goes up inevitably comes down and things divide
You think I worship Satan? Bitch, I am a Thelemite
Do what thou wilt, no dogma can close my wide open eyes
I'm sick of humankind, I'm always looking at the sky
I know no God is present, but it doesn't hurt to try
(Yeah, still spinning)
[Chorus]
No love, no life, deep in abyss I kreep, no sleep
'Til I'm motherfuckin' six-feet deep, I'ma keep low-key
No love, no life, nevermind, cremate me
Scatter my ashes all over the Mediterranean Sea
No love, no life, deep in abyss I kreep, no sleep
'Til I'm motherfuckin' six-feet deep, I'ma keep low-key
No love, no life, nevermind, cremate me
Scatter my ashes all over the Mediterranean Sea
