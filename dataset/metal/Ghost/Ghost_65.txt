[Intro: Sematary]
Ayy
[Chorus: Sematary]
Born to die, world's a fuck
Hundred million dead cops
Fuck the world, kill 'em all
Homie, we don't give no fucks
Born to die, world's a fuck
Hundred million dead cops
Fuck the world, kill 'em all
We don't ever fuck with opps
[Verse: Ghost Mountain]
1989
Haunted Mound, only see us in the night
Graveyard lullaby
Trash Man gonna come and skin your hide
Red Room valentine
Crimson dripping down, pouring wine
Swan song, cupid wings in the sky
Luna Ghost with a match blowing fire
Spaulding stick with my fireflies
Pull up
in the
death wagon
Kill 'em all, this the ballad of the dead
Sematary rocking with Ghost Mountain
Fire walk with me, brothers 'til the end (Yeah)
When you see me in the night
Better make your way back down
Hundred million graves
on top, Ghost Mountain
[Chorus: Sematary]
Born to die, world's a fuck
Hundred million dead cops
Fuck the world, kill 'em all
Homie, we don't give no fucks
Born to die, world's a fuck
Hundred million dead cops
Fuck the world, kill them all
We don't ever fuck with opps, ha
[Outro: Sematary]
(Coughing)
Fuck the world, we don't ever fuck with opps
Haunted Mound gives no fucks
Haunted Mound gives no fuck-
Ayy, ah
I don't wanna do this no more, 'cause you know
