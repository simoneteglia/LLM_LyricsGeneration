[Verse 1]
I broke the law in Madrid, and I'd do it again
I got a bitch in every city that I ever been
I thought the money would do something for the sadness in
Me, but I'm deeper in the abyss than I have ever been
I've got two million other tracks that all sound like this
So this flow is for the kids that all miss that shit
But really, I could give a fuck when anybody miss
I'm too chaotic, and the music gon' reflect that shit
[Verse 2]
You think you got it, oh, you think you got it
I always promised I would never rap about a narcotic
I'll keep my promise, but know that I'm still bein' honest
The help I need ain't comin', now I'm pushing a button
To self-destruct me, and no, I don't wanna talk about it
I'll never take you up on your offer to try to help me out of it
It's just a matter of time until I rest my eyes
Go to sleep and never come out of it
[Pre-Chorus]
(This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run, I'm not sorry)
[Chorus]
This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run, I'm not sorry
You can't get too close to me, you can't get too close to me
You can't get too close to me
I'll never be the me in your dream, I'm not sorry
This is the end for me (This is the end for me)
This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run, I'm not sorry
You can't get too close to me
I'll never be the me in your dream, I'm not sorry
This is the only way that I'll ever be, cut and run, I'm not sorry
You can't get too close to me, yeah
You can't get too close to me
