[Intro]
(When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)
(When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)
(When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)
(When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)
(When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)
Yeah
(When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)
(When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you)
[Verse 1]
When you die, ain't nobody gonna remember you
If you don't know me by now, I don't want you to
None of your favorite rappers ever tell the truth
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, out of my mind
It's about damn time y'all startin' to die
Lay low, I'm the ghost at your window
Went away, now I'm way away, there he go
Fuck an icon, eyes on A.I., oh, I
Fucked around and put a pipe bomb in your radio
[Pre-Chorus]
(A.I.) (A.I.) (A.I.) (A.I.
)
(A.I.) (A.I.) (A.I.) (
A.I.
)
[Chorus]
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I
(Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I
(Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be the one to bear the bad news
But a man who's claiming he's the man, ain't a man at all
Overcompensating for the lack of ability t
o really be an icon, not even a bygone
Modern-day unsustainable, painfully mundane
, forgettable
Gets old in a minute
Get sold to a label then never
(See them again)
[Bridge]
I spend all my time listening to guys who committed suicide
It's about time, it's about time
And I only ever really cry
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
I only ever cry
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
And I only ever cry
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
To wash away the blood
To wash away
[Verse 3]
Don't give a damn about a critic, they don't really get it
They don't make a difference, they don't buy the tickets, ah
Only really give a damn 'bout the kids
Live and die for the kids
Live and die for the kids (ah)
[Chorus]
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I
(Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I
(Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I
A.I., A.I., A.I., A.I
(Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I
(Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I., (Ooh) A.I
[Outro]
I only ever really
I only ever really
To wash away all the blood
