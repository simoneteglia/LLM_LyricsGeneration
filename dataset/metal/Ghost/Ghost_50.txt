Shtuom ruo neewteb seid ecapS tuo dna ni revO
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
My flesh is....
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
My flesh is cold, I held a ghost
(Ayy, ayy)
[Verse: XXXTENTACION &
BONES
]
I've held a ghost
And I could've been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And it slipped through my fingertips
And I, could've been
I've lost all hope
Deadboy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
I want nothing to do with this
Just face the abyss, and I (Ayy!)
Place blame for this shit (Ayy)
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist, wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that's the gist
Flushed, you can see it on me, I'm pissed, pissed
Lost in the mist (Ayy), pants full of piss (Ayy)
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick, brick
[Bridge: XXXTENTACION &
BONES
]
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
If we don't leave
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
We will burn with this town
Daisy, those are making Fugazi
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies (Ayy ayy, ayy ayy)
[Outro: XXXTENTACION &
BONES
]
Living a farce
If everything was everything
Living a farce, living a farce
Living a farce
I would never have to worry about anything
Living a farce, living a farce
I've held a ghost
And it slipped through my fingertips
