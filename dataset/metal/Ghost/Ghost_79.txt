[Verse 1]
Call out in the middle of the night (Night, night)
For when else would I hear you?
Fall out in the cold starlight (Light, light)
I can save you if you do
[Pre-Chorus]
You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
[Chorus]
(Call me) Little Sunshine
(Call me) Call me Mephistopheles
(Call me) When you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine
[Verse 2]
Light up in the middle of the day (Day, day)
For how else could you see me?
Ease up to the hunter from thе prey (Prey, prey)
And transform indеfinitely
[Pre-Chorus]
You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
[Chorus]
(Call me) Little Sunshine
(Call me) Call me Mephistopheles
(Call me) When you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
You will never walk alone
You can always reach me
You will never ever walk alone
Even when you're dead and gone
You can always reach me
All you gotta do is call me, call me
[Chorus]
(Call me) Little Sunshine
(Call me) Call me Mephistopheles
(Call me) When you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine
(Call me) Little Sunshine
(Call me) Call me Mephistopheles
(Call me) When you feel all alone
Just call me Little Sunshine
