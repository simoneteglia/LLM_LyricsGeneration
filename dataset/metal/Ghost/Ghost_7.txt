[Verse 1]
Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you, and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see
[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
[Verse 2]
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Tellin' those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean
[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart   beat
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standin' in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimmin' in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
[Outro]
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
