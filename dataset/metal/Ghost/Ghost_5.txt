[Intro]
Ask me if I give a fuck about a clique, ayy
Ask me if I give a fuck about a diss, yuh
Ask me if I give a fuck about fame, yuh
Recently I just don't give a fuck about a thing, yuh
[Chorus]
Ayy, ask me if I give a fuck about a diss, ayy
Ask me if I give a fuck about a clique, yuh
Ask me if I give a fuck about fame, yuh
Recently I just don't give a fuck about a thing, yuh
[Verse]
Ayy, I just decided by the grace of the god Poseidon
That you're so dead to me, I dug a hole for you to lie in
I'm sick and disownin' all the moments and the key components
That led me to follow hollow promises from empty monads
It's eleven degrees and I can see my breath, so I know I'm breathin'
But I got no pulse, I swear to Thelema, my heart ain't beating
I better get back to the black hole sun
Leavin' my gun, I don't need it for this one
I'm findin' the silver linin' and I'm minin' for hope
Tryna keep my wrists closed
[Bridge]
You are toxic
My blood, your lips
You are toxic
My blood, your lips
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm 'bout to pass and I know I'm not (Know I'm not)
Not comin' back 'til I resurrect (I resurrect)
Scatter me, so I don't ever come back
I was alone and I never wanna go back
[Chorus]
Ayy, ask me if I give a fuck about a diss, ayy
Ask me if I give a fuck about a clique, yuh
Ask me if I give a fuck about fame, yuh
Recently I just don't give a fuck about a thing, yuh, ayy
Ask me if I give a fuck about a diss, ayy
Ask me if I give a fuck about a clique, yuh
Ask me if I give a fuck about fame, yuh
Recently I just don't give a fuck about a thing, yuh
