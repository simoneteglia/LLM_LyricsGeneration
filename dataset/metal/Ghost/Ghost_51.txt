[Intro]
Yeah (
Ooh
), ayy (
Ooh
), ayy
Ayy (
Ooh
), ayy, ayy (
Fuck me, ooh
)
[Chorus]
I fucked around, and got a
brand new bitch
, ayy, yeah, ayy
Fuck her 'til her legs both twitch
, yeah
I still wanna die, but got someone to do it with, ayy
She put my hand up on her throat, and told me, "Squeeze that shit," yeah
I fucked around, and got a brand new bitch, ayy, yeah, ayy
Fuck her 'til her legs both twitch, yeah
I still wanna die, but got someone to do it with, ayy
She put my hand up on her throat, and told me, "Squeeze that shit," yeah
[Verse]
Looking her right in the eyes, and my thumb on her tongue (And my thumb on her tongue)
Gripping her jaw like a fish out of water, I'm sprung (Fish out of water, I'm sprung)
I pushed her back to the wall, and said, "You done" (Said, "You done")
She imitated a Super Soaker, then I soak her, and get up, and go, bitch
Bitches, they come and go, and
This one ain't going
'Cause I'm cuffing like Joe Fontana
Fuck all that sentimental
Put your face in the pillow
And give me them hands
Bitch, you wanna, you wanna die, but
I'm gonna take your soul
[Chorus]
I fucked around, and got a brand new bitch, ayy, yeah, ayy
Fuck her 'til her legs both twitch, yeah
I still wanna die, but got someone to do it with, ayy
She put my hand up on her throat, and told me, "Squeeze that shit," yeah
I fucked around, and got a brand new bitch, ayy, yeah, ayy
Fuck her 'til her legs both twitch, yeah
I still wanna die, but got someone to do it with, ayy
She put my hand up on her throat, and told me, "Squeeze that shit," yeah
