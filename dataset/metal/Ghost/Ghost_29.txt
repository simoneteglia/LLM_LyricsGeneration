(Ayy, yeah, fuck everything, bitch)

(I don't wanna talk no more)
[Chorus]
I don't really want no weed
(Hell yeah)
I don't really want no friends (Hell yeah)

[Interlude: Manly P. Hall]
"This world is a school—no one expects to stay in school forever"
[Verse 2]
Sever the limbs off my torso and burn what remains
Ayy, shouts out to Coheed
I would not be alive if I gave in to one of the times
That I wanted to be 6 feet deep beneath all of our feet
, ayy
I've given up on giving up
I found a reason to be in hopes you will deify me
I'm sick of writing, I would rather be in
Andromeda
That way it would take a billion years for you to find me
[Outro]
Candle wax burns on her back in the shape of a pentacle
(Shape of a pentacle—!)
