[Verse 1]
(Ghostbusters)
If there's something strange
In your neighborhood
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
If there's something weird
And it don't look good
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
[Chorus]
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
[Verse 2]
If you're seeing things
Running through your head
Who can you call?
(Ghostbusters)
An invisible man
Sleepin' in your bed
Ow, who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
[Chorus]
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
Uh, I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
[Verse 3]
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
If you're all alone
Pick up the phone
And call
(Ghostbusters)
[Bridge]
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
Ooh, I hear it likes the girls
Hm, I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 4]
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Mm-ef, if you've had a dose of a
Freaky ghost, baby
You better call
(Ghostbusters)
Ow
[Interlude]
Lemme tell ya something
Bustin' makes me feel good
[Chorus]
I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
Uh, I ain't 'fraid of no ghost
[Verse 5]
Don't get caught alone, oh no
(Ghostbusters)
When it comes through your door
Unless you just a-want some more
I think you better call
(Ghostbusters)
Ow
[Outro]
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Uh, think you better call
(Ghostbusters)
Ha-ha, who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
I can't hear you
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Louder
(Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Who can you call?
(Ghostbusters)
Who you gonna call?
(Ghostbusters)
Uh, it likes the girls too
(Ghostbusters)
