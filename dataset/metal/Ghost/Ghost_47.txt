[Intro]
Why won't? (Time)
Slow down (Why won't?)
Why won't? (Time)
Slow... down!
We all go down
(Down, down, down)
We all will drown
(Drown, drown)
[Verse 1]
Fucked up and let down
No one to save me now
So alone, so alone
Face down on the ground
Looked up, saw no light (No light)
Everybody lied!
[Chorus]
Break, fuck, kill!
You will never, never, never be saved!
Break, fuck, kill!
You will never, never, never be saved!
[Verse 2]
Keeping a gun loaded under my bed
'Cause I know that one day you'll be swallowing lead
When enough is enough and I'm ready to be all up in the Ethereal
Plane
Break everything you want, fuck everything that won't (Ah-ahh-ahh)
Kill the ones that make the laws
[Chorus]
Break, fuck, kill!
You will never, never, never be saved!
Break, fuck, kill!
You will never, never, never be saved!
Never be saved!
You will never, never, never be saved!
