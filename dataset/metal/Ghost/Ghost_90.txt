[Intro]
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
[Verse]
Henny in my veins, I'm lit (Henny in my veins, I'm lit)
Puffin' on a wood tip black with no way to get back to the way shit been (To the way shit been)
I am alive, yet I can't seem to live
Ayy, blackmage on a bit of cocaine that I ate at 8th in Spokane
Trippin' like I got one shoestring and the other tied in a noose, ayy
Don't speak
Talk is cheap
Tie you up and make you bleed
Blood all up on your sheets
You wished and now you receive
Lie in the way of me you might see
Skinny mothafucka will remove all of your teeth
Use 'em for voodoo while you're fast asleep
Killin' me
In your dreams
I don't wanna get up
Everybody gotta-gotta washed up brain
Utter me a seance (Utter me a seance)
Bring a deity to his knees when you utter my name
Ayy, fuck fame, I just wanna put your career in the grave
Knock-knock-knockin' on wood with a hammer and a metal nail sealin' your box up so you won't escape
Fuck
I'm in the darkest of places with nowhere to go but down
[Chorus]
Question everything and never think that anyone got your back
What a bright light in the sky
You call it God and I call it a lie
Question everything and never think that anyone got your back
(Question everything and never think that anyone got your back)
What a bright light in the sky
You call it God and I call it a lie (You call it God and I call it a lie)
[Outro]
I see the way you watch me
You wish that I would just summon a Daemon to take you away
I've learned to love misery
Even in the blackest abyss you can find me and watch me decay
I see the way you watch me
You wish that I would just summon a DÃ†MON to take you away
I've learned to love misery
Even in the blackest abyss you can find me and watch me decay
