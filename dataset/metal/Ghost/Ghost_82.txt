[Verse]
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
Like a bit of road kill on the 95
Sick of wanting to cry, sick of wanting to die
Fuck that (No more!)
More to life than always tryna leave it behind
I guess I'm fucking up a lot, ayy
Find a bit of silver lining in a
black cloud
, sing aloud
I'm never gonna let the devil take me down, or get me down
Galileo (Find a way out)
Find a way out
Speaking up will get ya locked up like religion
Pillage everything about a woke-up mind, I'm 'bout to
Say a prayer (No one listens!)
Stay away, I
Got a bit of blasphemy in me, young blast from the past
Reminiscent Varg Vikernes on the wrong path like
[Bridge]
Nobody really give a motherfuck! (A motherfuck!)
What you say? Bitch, I'll cut your fucking tongue! (Fucking tongue!)
Nobody really give a motherfuck! (A motherfuck!)
What you say? Bitch, I'll cut your fucking tongue! (Fucking tongue!)
[Interlude]
(I never wanna know how it feels to be at the top alone)
Ayy
[Chorus]
Hexada
Never gonna let up, and I'm running to the end of the tunnel, I swear to the sun
Someone said there was a light around there, I'm beginning to see a ray, I hope it's what I dreamed and wanted, I
Never been better
Seek your vendetta, by then I'll be gone
There's more to life than just being alone
Somebody told me it's okay to smile (Smile!)
Hexada
Never gonna let up and I'm running to the end of the tunnel, I swear to the sun
Someone said there was a light around there, I'm beginning to see a ray, I hope it's what I dreamed and wanted, I
Never been better
Seek your vendetta, by then I'll be gone
There's more to life than just being alone
Somebody told me it's okay to smile (Smile!)
[Outro]
Smile, somebody tell me it's okay to smile
There's more to life
Than saying goodbye, to, it
And everything, you, know
I wanted someone -anyone- beside me, so I wouldn't have to feel alone anymore
