[Chorus]
I'm in a million fuckin’ pieces
Pick me up off the floor
Ceaseless
Put me together and break me more
[Verse 1]
On the way to a new level, I'm levelin' up again
Call me the Alpha Mage
(
Put a bullet in the Government
)
I’ve had enough, should put it in a grave
Had to be the one to run up in front of the bus of a popular opinion
And become a martyr for smaller voices than mine
[Bridge]
I just bought a bonesaw to cut my hands off
Had to get the cuffs off, you kept me down too long
And now I think twice
Fuck the advice, 'cause nobody knows (Nobody knows)
[Verse 2]
Grippin' the sides of my face and I never wanna see anyone I know again
And I'm okay with enemies shaking hands over my grave saying
"Life is too short..."
Everything is a pathetic aesthetic
Now don't worry, I'll keep on challengin' those who want sharper mentalities
As we get close to the death of society
[Interlude]
(I'm not gonna make it...)
(I’m not gonna make it...)
I’m not gonna make it!
I'm not gonna make it!
(Out of this)
[Chorus]
I’m in a million fuckin' pieces
Pick me up off the floor
Ceaseless
Put me together and break me more
