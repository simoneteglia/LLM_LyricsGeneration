[Verse 1: Cardinal Copia]
There is a scourge in the guise of sanctity
A perpetrator with a quill, although it's
Often steeped in well-spun mystery
The accuser sends the bill, yeah
[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
I am all eyes
I am all ears
I am the wall
And I'm watching you fall
[Post-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Because faith is mine
[Verse 2: Cardinal Copia]
The Luddites shun the diabolical
A fecal trail across the land, although it
Stinks, feels, and looks identical
A pack of fools can take the stand, ha!
[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
I am all eyes
I am all ears
I am the wall
And I'm watching you fall
[Post-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Because faith is mine
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I am all eyes
I am all ears
I am the wall
And I'm watching you fall
Hehehahahaha
[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
I am all eyes
I am all ears
I am the wall
And I'm watching you fall
I am all eyes
I am all ears
I am the wall
And I'm watching you fall
[Post-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Because faith is mine
[Organ Outro]
