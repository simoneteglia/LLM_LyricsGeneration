[Verse 1: Cardinal Copia]
Many a sin I have witnessed and in many indeed I have been
Many a rat I've befriended and so many a thorn stood between
But of all the demons I've known, none could compare to you
[Pre-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Every day that you feed me with hate
I grow stronger
Every day that you feed me with hate
I grow stronger
[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
[Verse 2: Cardinal Copia]
Many a mind I have haunted and in many a way I have been
Often the one to have flaunted an image grotesque and obscene
But of all these dark roads that I roam, none could compare to you
[Pre-Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Every day that you feed me with hate
I grow stronger
Every day that you feed me with hate
I grow stronger
[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus: Cardinal Copia]
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
[Outro: Cardinal Copia]
Every day that you feed me with hate
(Drink me, eat me)
I grow stronger!
(Then you'll see the light)
Every day that you feed me with hate
(Drink me, eat me)
I grow stronger!
(Then you'll see the light)
