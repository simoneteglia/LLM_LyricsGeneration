[Intro]
(Hack and slash away)
(Hack and slash away, away)
[Verse 1]
Never need a MAC, black trench on my back
Nails black like a young Wil Francis' pants
With a Deicide patch
Kerosene in my hand
And a Zippo for the motherfuckers hiding behind the net
Don't play victim, I'm the one who never got away from the pain
Tried to pray, but God is on a holiday
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hacking and slashing you bitches
Took a sip of cyanide, but I'm living
Damn
What will it take to get rid of me?
When I die, don't pretend you a friend of me, yah
I'm hacking and slashing you bitches
Took a sip of cyanide but I'm living
Damn
What will it take to get rid of me, yah?
What will it take to get rid of me?
[Chorus]
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
I'm hacking and slashing you bitches
I turned my bitch into a witch and I'm
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
[Verse 2]
Blackest of mages
The tat on my face
I'm amazed at the rate I've been getting away
With the manipulation of energy, made it a friend to me
Used to my benefit, and if it makes you believe any more
Than you did before you read the tat on my head
Then I led you straight to the awakening of a mentality
Hidden away by the powers that be
[Chorus]
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
Hacking 'em, slashing 'em
I'm hacking and slashing you bitches
I turned my bitch into a witch, and I'm
(Hack) Hacking 'em, (Slash) slashing 'em
(Hack) Hacking 'em, (Slash!) slashing 'em
