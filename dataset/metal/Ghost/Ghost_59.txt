[Verse 1: Papa Emeritus III]
We're standing here by the abyss
And the world is in flames
Two star-crossed lovers reaching out
To the beast with many names
[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is insurrection, He is spite, He's the force that made me be
He is Nostro Dispater,
Nostr'Alma Mater
He is
[Verse 2: Papa Emeritus III]
We are hiding here inside a dream
And all our doubts are now destroyed
The guidance of the morning star
Will lead the way into the void
[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is insurrection, He is spite, He's the force that made me be
He is Nostro Dispater,
Nostr'Alma Mater
He is
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus: Papa Emeritus III]
He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is insurrection, He is spite, He's the force that made me be
He is, He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see
And He is the disobedience that holds us together
He is Nostro Dispater,
Nostr'Alma Mater
And we are falling over the precipice
[Instrumental Outro]
