[Verse 1]
Father said that this world isn't for me
I tried to pray for a new reality
"So, come to me, we can change night into day."
A tied-up moth seemed to know a different way
(Don't remember it
Don't return to it)
[Verse 2]
Oh, Father tore out the umbilical cord
There's nothing left in the bottle keeping me scored
We'll abandon the scenery in the
(Don't remember it
Don't return to it)
Rear-view mirror
[Chorus]
A petty line of white noise
Pack up your bags and throw out the toys
Three strikes, and "Honey, I'm home!"
Three voices come from the gramophone
A vivisection of me
Yielded the start of a mystery
Say "Hello! Honey, I'm home!"
Three voices come from the gramophone
[Verse 3]
God returned with the moth chained to his hand
"There's so many things that you'll never understand...
So, come to me, we can change night into day
You'll hold my hand, so you never go astray."
(God devoured that of Father)
[Verse 4]
A spider preaching with poison on its lips
"To get out of here is to promise me a kiss."
The abandonment of scenery in the...
Mind of Mother
(Don't remember it
Don't return to it)
[Pre-Chorus]
So, with advice of the dead
And a halo over my head
[Chorus]
At last "Honey, I'm home!"
Three voices come all alone
A vivisection of me
Done by God, for all to see
Say "Hello! Honey, I'm home!"
Three voices come all alone
[Outro]
(Da-da-lo, da-da-la, da-da-lo, da-da-la)
(Da-da-lo, da-da-la, da-da-lo, da-da-la)
A vivisection of me
Done by God, for all to see
(Da-da-lo, da-da-la, da-da-lo, da-da-la)
(Da-da-lo, da-da-la, da-da-lo, da-da-la)
A vivisection of me
Done by God, for all to see
