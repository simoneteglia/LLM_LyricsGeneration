[Verse 1]
Fuck everything, I'm gone (Gone)
Leave it alone
Every time I get so close then it all gets blown (Blown)
Don't play along
Everybody think they know, but they all just clones
Marchin' along
Really wanna give my skull a brand new hole (A brand new hole)
But I won't, though
I don't wanna get no blood on my Grandma floor
(Floor)
Burden my soul
One foot in the plane and the other one in inferno ('No)
Master your alchemy, master the world, listen,
as above, so below
Pussy ass bitch don't know a damn thing except what the fuck you told (Told)
You cannot fuck with a level 10 mage like Ghoste
[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning feelin' like I'm John Dee
Got my black magic book, and drew a circle 'round me
Bitch, I wake up in the morning feelin' like I'm not me
I'm a beast, I'm a killer,
I'm a young Crowley
I'm a young Crowley
[Verse 2]
Come to my show, get fucked in your soul
Spittin' that hate, better get your ass on
I got a lot of shit but no control
Draw me a circle 'round me on the floor
Summon the demons that worship the goat
Deep in abyss, here they come and they go
Snatchin' your soul, leavin' just skin and bones
Eternal torture, I'm stealin' your ghost
Had enough dope
Had enough hope
How do I cope?
Where do I go?
No one I know
Seen what I seen, I'm a lonely soul
I can barely tell a friend from foe
All that I know is I don't know
where to call home
Where to go?
No heart I can stow
In a safe place, I'm a dead-end joke
Still want to come to the plane?
Let's go
[Bridge]
I hate everything
I hate everything
We are not the same, I can feel no pain
I hate everything
I hate everything
We are not the same, I can feel no pain
[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning feelin' like I'm John Dee
Got my black magic book, and drew a circle 'round me
Bitch, I wake up in the morning feelin' like I'm not me
I'm a beast, I'm a killer,
I'm a young Crowley
I wake up in the morning feelin' like I'm John Dee
Got my black magic book, and drew a circle 'round me
Bitch, I wake up in the morning feelin' like I'm not me
I'm a beast, I'm a killer,
I'm a young Crowley
