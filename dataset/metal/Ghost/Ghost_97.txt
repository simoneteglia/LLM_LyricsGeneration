[Intro]
Dread, dread, dread, dread, dread, dread, dread, dread
[Chorus]
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
[Verse]
Talk about ya bad habits
Beating down ya goddamn door
Pussy 'mothafuckers' wanna be bad
They wanna be mad, they try to be sad
But never had a reason to cry
Wake up every other morning with a reason to die
But I'm really looking for another reason for life
I'm ready to fuck everything up
I took a swing at living by the
book
but never
(
Made it past the prologue
)
Shawty only like me 'cause her daddy don't (
Daddy don't
)
Took her soul 'cause I don't got one of my own (
Of my own
)
I'm too dead inside, I got no love to show (
Love to show
)
Somebody stop this pain in my chest
Never gave into Satan, I'm putting that speculation to rest
[Bridge]
I feel something
I feel something
This isn't good
Oh, no, this isn't good
Oh, no, this isn't good
Oh, no, this isn't good
Oh, no!
I don't know if it's love or hate
And I don't really care
I know I don't care!
You made me into this filth
And it really isn't fair
But now you gotta deal with it
[Chorus]
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
I got a noose (Yeah)
I got a noose (Ayy, yeah)
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
Around my neck, around my neck
[Outro]
Made it past the prologue
