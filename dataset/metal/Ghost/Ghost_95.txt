[Verse 1]
Take seven steps back (Back)
I don’t give a damn if a motherfucker wearing all black
Run that lip don’t know how to act
Face get smacked with a Louisville bat
Now think on that (Think on that)
Wannabe, never has been really wanna beef with me (Beef with me)
I chop 'em up and put they body parts in a ice box like
JGRXXN (Like JGRXXN)
K, R, double E, P, say hey to the brand new wave (Brand new wave)
Keep on re-tweetin my shit I'ma remember who there from day one
(One) Pussy motherfucker talking shit behind the screen for fun
I prefer jiu-jitsu, get up pussy boy, you need a gun
(Pussy boy, you need a gun)
[Chorus]
Lookin' down the barrel of my 22
I never thought it’d come to this, I bet you didn’t too
And rest in peace to all my kin who didn’t make it through
I see you soon as I meet my doom
I meet my doom, I me-me-me-me
[Verse 2]
Russian Roulette when I walk out the door
Enemies lurkin' like COD 4
Problems with trust 'cause I been there before
You neva lookin' me in the eyes when I spoke
Nothin' new under the sun, but I’m doin' it better than ever before
Wanna make a hypebeast so mad
That he wanna confront me at one of my shows
Seen them mothafuckas reppin' so flow
Spittin' no flow, hit the flow go, bury yo' head like a dodo
There’s something special 'bout the morning after LSD
Trippin and fuckin’ the night away, I’m saving me from destiny
Lock up, all of yo' secrets and keep seven steps away from me
[Chorus]
Lookin' down the barrel of my 22
I never thought it’d come to this, I bet you didn’t too
And rest in peace to all my kin who didn’t make it through
I see you soon as I meet my doom, I meet my doom
Look-look-look-look-look
Lookin’ down the barrel of my 22
I never thought it’d come to this, I bet you didn’t too
And rest in peace to all my kin that didn’t make it through
I see you soon as I meet my doom, I meet my doom
[Outro]
Look-look-look-look-look
Look-look-look-look-look
Lookin’ down the barrel of my 22
