[Chorus]
Stuck in my mind
Get me out
[Verse]
I been sad, I been tryna get a grip
I been getting mad at shit that don't make sense to me
If only you knew about my mind right now
And everything that go through it
Daydream about all the sex and the ritual sacrifice I could commit
Throwing your heart to Ammit
,
kill the machines
Watching your world fall apart at the seams
What if they learned to breathe?
Upload my consciousness when I'm deceased
Around my neck, rep the crest 'til I take a rest
Trying to avoid droid ploys, won't escape
N/O/I/S/E
[Chorus]
Locked in my mind
Get me out
(Find a safe place)
Get me out
