[Intro: St. Trident Tenors of Tinseltown]
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer
[Verse 1: Papa Emeritus II]
Since dawn of time the fate of man is that of lice
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes
A day of reckoning when penance is to burn
Countdown together now and say the words
That you will learn
[Chorus: Papa Emeritus II]
Hell Satan,
Archangelo
Hell Satan,
welcome Year Zero
Hell Satan,
Archangelo
Hell Satan,
welcome Year Zero
[Bridge: St. Trident Tenors of Tinseltown]
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub
Asmodeus,ï»¿ Satanas, Lucifer
[Verse 2: Papa Emeritus II]
Crestfallen kings and queens comforting in their faith
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the Wraith
Since fate of man is equal to the fate of lice
As new dawn rises, you shalt recognize
Now, behold the Lord of Flies
[Chorus: Papa Emeritus II]
Hell Satan,
Archangelo
Hell Satan,
welcome Year Zero
Hell Satan
[Guitar Solo: Nameless Ghoul (Fire)]
[Bridge: Papa Emeritus II]
He will tremble the nations
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations
A daughter to fall for a son
The ancient serpent deceiver
To masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of God
[Chorus: Papa Emeritus II &
St. Trident Tenors of Tinseltown
