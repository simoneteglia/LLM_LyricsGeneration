[Verse 1]
I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting along
Ghost in your house, ghost in your arms
When you're tossing, when you turn in your sleep
It's because I'm ghosting your dreams
[Chorus 1]
And this is why I have decided
To pull these old white sheets from my head
I'll leave them folded neat and tidy
So that you'll know I'm out of hiding
Yeah
[Verse 2]
I've been ghosting, I've been ghosting alone
Ghost in the world, ghost with no home
I remember, I remember the days
When I'd make you oh-so afraid
[Chorus 2]
And this is why I have decided
To leave your house and home unhaunted
You don't need poltergeists for sidekicks
You don't need treats and you don't need tricks
[Post-Chorus]
You don't need treats, you don't need tricks
You don't need no Halloween
You don't need treats, you don't need tricks
And you don't need me
Me
[Bridge]
Oooh
Hey, would it be so bad if I stayed?
I'm just a ghost out of his grave
And I can't make love in my grave
I won't put white into your hair
I won't make noises in your stairs
I will be kind and I'll be sweet
If you stop staring straight through me
[Chorus]
And this is why I have decided
To pull these old white sheets from my head
I'll leave them folded neat and tidy
So that you'll know I'm out of hiding
And this is why I have decided
To leave your house and home unhaunted
You don't need poltergeist for sidekicks
You don't need treats and you don't need tricks
[Outro]
You don't need treats, you don't need tricks
You don't need no Halloween
You don't need treats, you don't need tricks
You don't need treats, you don't need no Hallows' Eve
You don't need treats, you don't need tricks
And you don't need me
