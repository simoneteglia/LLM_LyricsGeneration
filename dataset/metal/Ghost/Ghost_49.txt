[Verse 1]
I said to you, "Why did you do it?"
Touch the glass, I'll feel ya through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot
[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
[Verse 2]
Gotta be all that
coco,
ayy?
Playin' too much of that
GTA
Playin' too much of that Dr. Dre
Doom, Quake, where'd you get the gun from, eh?
Really think that
metal
gonna make you safe?
Playing peek-a-boo with the devil these days
Black cap back with a trench coat, ayy
Living in the valley cuttin' porno tapes
(
Living in the valley cuttin' porno
)
[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
[Verse 3]
Were you bored of gender norms?
Of being alone, no mama home
A bad divorce, or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own?
Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro
You wore her old bathrobe
Too small to see the road
[Bridge]
We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokémon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and Real Monsters
Capri Sun, straw in the bottom
[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
[Verse 4]
Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook
,
names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Supervillain with a manifesto, dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you, man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007, Nintendo games
Burned Hot Pockets in the microwave
[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
[Outro]
