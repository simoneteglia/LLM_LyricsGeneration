[Intro]
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
THE GHOSTBUSTERS!
VS!
THE MYTHBUSTERS!
BEGIN!
[Ghostbusters]
Are you tired of two geeks in mustaches
Who can manage to be boring with explosions and crashes?
If you, or the Lorax
,
wanna bust like we do
Give us a call
,
we're ready to defeat you
Ghostbusters, flow crushers, get the job done
Spitting out the lyrics like, 'we got one!'
Get the people moving like the Statue of Liberty
Try to beat us in a battle?
(Man, you gotta be kidding me)
The delivery of Stantz stands straight like my main man's slinky
I collect spores
(tell 'em 'bout the Twinkie)
Like your show, it's all fluff and filler
I'll kick your hiney man, I'm a savage killer
[Mythbusters]
Wow, your raps are just too wack to handle
Let's do it like we do on the Discovery Channel
Your science is preposterous, the opposite of competent process
And in this episode, we'll give you a synopsis
Starting with the vacuum cleaners strapped up on your back
It's a fact, positrons don't react like that
You built a laser grid with no safety switch
And Walter Peck was right, that's some shady shit
Good thing you work in a firehouse, cause you just got burned
You are poor scientists
,
and that's confirmed
[Ghostbusters]
That's enough from the Walrus and Dickless the clown
Let's show these Mythbitches how we do it downtown
Grab your stick (holdin'), heat em up (smokin')
High speed shows your ass get beat in slow motion
We roast show hosts
when our flows cross streams
Pumping out blockbusters
,
while you work behind the scenes
It's a rap test dummy, and you're both getting crashed
We came, we saw, we kicked your ass
[Mythbusters]
Ghosts aren't real
,
but it should be said
It's time to bring the B-Team back from the dead
(Hey!)
Things are getting scary
, when
Tory, Grant and Kari
Come harder than Ray when that ghost popped his cherry
We reject your flows, and substitute our own
Uhhhhhhhmmm...
Why'd you stop? I couldn't think of a rhyme
Well just say the first thing that pops into your mind
[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]
Aww... aww...
Yo, raise up, it's Stay Puft, I stay fluff
Blaze chumps
and flip Kari butter-side up (hey!)
I'mma smother Ghostbusters in fluffernutter, I don't play
Show these dweebs how to rock a beret (hey)
I live so large you can't harsh my mellow
Just one step took me out the ghetto
You best be afraid of my marshmallow flows
Cause Big Puft just turned all you bitches to toast
WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EPIC! RAP, RAP! RRRRRRRAP BATTLES OF HISTORY!
