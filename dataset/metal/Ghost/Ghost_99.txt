[Verse 1]
When you call, when you call, when you call and I'm horny, mm
I've been waitin', I've been waitin', I've been waitin' on your body, mm
Don't you know I've been dancin' alone at the party? Mm
All my friends gettin' laid and I ain't found nobody, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
We can go back to your place
I swear, I'll be gone in the morning
Just touch me like that
Oh, baby
[Chorus]
I don't, I don't need no candlelight
You just need to fuck me right
Guess I ain't the loving kind
I just wanna get some
I don't, I don't wanna wait no more
Let's do it on the kitchen floor
Give me what I'm beggin' for
I just wanna get some
[Drop]
I just wanna get some
[Verse 2]
Don't pretend, don't pretend, don't pretend like we're lovers, mm
Like it's more than two strangers underneath the covers, mm
When I'm here on my own, there's a part that I'm missing, hm-mm
I'll go blind if I don't get to see what you're giving, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
We can go back to your place
I swear, I'll be gone in the morning
Just touch me like that
Oh, baby
[Chorus]
I don't, I don't need no candlelight
You just need to fuck me right
Guess I ain't the loving kind
I just wanna get some
I don't, I don't wanna wait no more
We can do it on the kitchen floor
Give me what I'm beggin' for
I just wanna get some
[Drop]
I just wanna get some
[Chorus]
I don't, I don't need no candlelight
You just need to fuck me right
Guess I ain't the loving kind
I just wanna get some
I don't, I don't wanna wait no more
We can do it on the kitchen floor
Give me what I'm beggin' for
I just wanna get some
[Outro]
I just wanna get some
