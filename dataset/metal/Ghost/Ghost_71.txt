[Verse 1]
I'm gettin' hickeys from my bed bugs
I'm gettin' busy with
a bad perfume
I'm stickin' kisses to a pen drug
I'm makin' friction with a sad vacuum
[Verse 2]
I'm gettin' jiggy with a rifle
I'll pull the trigger with my eyes closed
Hopin' to hit you somewhere vital
And when I miss, you come and kiss me with a smile
[Chorus]
I'm havin' sex with a ghost
'Cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleepin' with a
Sex with a ghost
'Cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleepin' with a ghoul
[Verse 3]
The only time I ever see her
Is when she's behind me in the mirror
Even from a distance, I can hear her
I try to listen, but her whispers make my ears hurt
And on our dates, it's never daytime
When she gets playful with a steak knife
I need a break, maybe I'll take five
Shake it up and medicate, maybe I'll take five
[Chorus]
I'm havin' sex with a ghost
'Cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleepin' with a
Sex with a ghost
'Cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleepin' with a ghoul
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
I'm havin' sex with a ghost
'Cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleepin' with a
Sex with a ghost
'Cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool
I'm sleepin' with a ghoul
