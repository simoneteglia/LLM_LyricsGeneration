[Intro]
One, two
One, two
[Verse 1]
All I need is some inspiration
Before I do somebody some harm
I feel just like a vegetable
Down here on the farm
Nobody comes to see me
Nobody here to turn me on
I ain't even got a lover
Down here on the farm
[Verse 2]
They told me to get healthy
They told me to get some sun
But boredom eats me like cancer
Down here on the farm
Drinkin' lemonade shandy
Ain't nobody here to do me harm
For I'm like a fish out of water
Down here on the farm
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I wrote a thousand letters
Till my fingers all gone numb
But I never see no postman
Down here on the farm
I call my baby on the telephone, I say
"Come down and have some fun"
But she knows what the score is
Down here on the farm
[Verse 4]
I can't fall in love with a wheat field
I can't fall in love with a barn
When everything smells like horse shit
Down here on the farm
Blue skies and swimming pools
Add so much charm
But I'd rather be back in Soho
Than down here on the farm
On the fucking farm
[Outro]
Are you born in a fucking barn or what?
Baaa, hold still
