[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about, thinking 'bout sex
Always hungry for something that I haven't had yet
Well, maybe, baby, you got something to lose
Well, I got something, I got something for you
[Chorus]
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes to
[Verse 2]
Panties round your knees with your ass in debris
Doing that grind with a push and a squeeze
Tied up, tied down, up against the wall
Be my rubber made, baby, and we can do it all
[Chorus]
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes toni-i-i-i-i-ght, yeah-yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight, oh yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight-ay-ay-ay-ay, yeah
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
My way, your way, anything goes tonight
[Outro]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Anything goes tonight
Oh woah woah woah, woah...
Said anything goes tonight
