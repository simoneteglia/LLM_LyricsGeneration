[Spoken Intro]
Hey fuckers! Suck on Guns N' fuckin' Roses!
[Verse 1]
I am reckless and feeling no pain
You know I have got no need to control
Living with the danger, I am always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Living like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain and you know I know my part
[Verse 2]
On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I am never alone because I have got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Living like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain because it is coming from my heart
[Bridge]
I lead a reckless life and I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only vice
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Reckless life, I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only
Reckless life, I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only
