[Intro]
This one's for you, Johhny
[Verse 1]
It doesn't pay to try
All the smart boys know why
It doesn't mean I didn't try
I just never know why
It's isn't 'cause I'm all alone
Oh, baby, you're not home
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone
It's so restless, as I am
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense
Down inside my bones
And even though it don't show
Those scars aren't so old
[Chorus]
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try
Don't try
[Verse 2]
You're just a bastard kid
And you got no name
Could you live with me?
Go on and say
And even though it don't show
Those scars aren't so old
[Chorus]
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try
Don't try
[Bridge]
Johnny, you're me, yeah, your memory
I want to put my arms around your memory
[Outro]
I can't try
I can't try
Don't try
Come on
LAMF
Like a mother fucker
Yo, Johnny, what color were her eyes?
Oh, she was wearing shades?
Fuck yeah
