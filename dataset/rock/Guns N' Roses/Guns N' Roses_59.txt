[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Took my changes carelessly
I said I choked on my own cigarette
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey, baby
But ya haven't seen the worst yet
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
I had a woman who had said it was all alright
Now I'm back the only one
[Chorus]
And I ain't standing, never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Oh no
[Verse 2]
Stole my changes helplessly
I said yeah, but I got no regrets
Money it was on the table
So I booked with all the bets
Living like your livin' ain't so hot
And you ain't my idea
Of a high-rolling shot
[Chorus]
So I ain't standing, I'm never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Oh no
[Solo]
[Verse 3]
High price calling hanging over your head
I hope you've heard, baby, all I've said
You've gone cold or even misread
No use crying, you're as good as dead
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun
I had a woman who had said it was all alright
Now I'm back the only one
[Chorus]
And I ain't standing, never standing
In the shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
Shadow of your love
[Outro]
Shadow, shadow
Shadow of your love
Oh no
