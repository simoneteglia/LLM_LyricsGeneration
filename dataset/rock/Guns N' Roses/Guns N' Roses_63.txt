[Verse 1]
Diamonds and fast cars, money to burn
I got my head in the clouds, I got these thoughts to churn
Got my feet in the sand, I got a house on the hill
I got a headache like a mother twice the price of my thrills
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a cold day in the continental drift
I said this traffic is hell, can you give me a lift?
And I'll try to paint a story, got your pictures to tell
Yeah, you got to make a livin' with what you bring yourself to sell
[Verse 2]
I got some genuine, imitation bad apples
Free sample for your peace of mind, only $9.95
[Pre-Chorus]
I got my camera back from customs,
got my law fees up to date
Hell, they must've seen me comin', ain't this life so fuckin' great?
[Chorus]
When the shit hit the fan, it was all I could stand, yeah
Well, I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathin' while it can but what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky, well, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me, I'd say, just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch?
[Verse 3]
Gold and caviar
Now, won't you pour my apathy?
I'd have all the bases covered
If I could teach my hands to see
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, we're down in the deep end where they'd love to watch you drown
I said, your laundry could use washing, we'll hang it up all over town
I said, Hollywood's like a dryer an' we're down on Sunset Strip
An' you'll be suckin' down the Clorox 'til your life's all nice and crisp
[Chorus]
When the shit hits the fan, it was all I could stand, yeah
I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathin' while it can but what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me, I'd say, just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
When the shit hits the fan, it was all I could stand, yeah
I'm a frequent flyer
My body's breathin' while it can but what I don't understand is that
My world ain't gettin' no brighter
If I could touch the sky, I would float on by
While everybody's talkin', hell, I'm just another guy
If it were up to me, I'd say, just leave me be
Why let one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch?
Why let that one bad apple spoil the whole damn bunch?
[Outro]
Boy!
