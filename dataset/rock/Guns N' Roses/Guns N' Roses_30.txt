[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a trace
Looking for a heart
Looking for a lover in a world
That's much too dark
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want my love
You want satisfaction, oh yeah
You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another piece of the action, yeah
[Verse 2]
Said where you going
What you gonna do
I've been looking everywhere
I've been looking for you
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want my love
You want satisfaction, I've got your satisfaction
You don't need my love
You got to find yourself another piece of the action
[Chorus]
Because you're crazy, hey hey
You're fucking crazy, oh my
You know you're crazy, oh child
I said you're crazy, ay, ay, yeah
Uh yeah, aow, oh!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Say, boy, where you coming from
Where would you get that point of view
When I was younger
Said I knew someone like you
[Pre-Chorus]
And they said, "You don't want my love"
You want satisfaction
You don't need my love
You've got to find yourself another piece of the action
[Chorus]
'Cause you're crazy, hey hey
You're fucking crazy, oh my
You know you're crazy, oh child
I said you're crazy
Oh, you're crazy
You know you're crazy
Well, you're crazy
You know you're crazy, oh
[Outro]
You know you are
Bring it down
You're fuckin' crazy
