[Intro]
(Is she really going out with him?)
Hey!
[Verse 1]
I got a feeling inside of me
It's kinda strange, like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
These kinds of things got to be
[Chorus]
I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
[Verse 2]
See the sun, see the sunny skies
Don't get too close, it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
Come back another day
[Chorus]
I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
[Bridge]
I never thought this could happen to me
I'm a strange washing machine
I don't deserve somebody this sane
I better get her, maybe-be too late
Hey
[Verse 1]
Ahh, I got a feeling inside of me
It's kinda strange, like a stormy sea
I don't know why, don't know why
I guess these things gotta be
[Chorus]
I got a new rose, I got it good
Yes, I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
