[Verse 1]
Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain
If I said that you're my friend and our love would never end
How long before I had your trust again?
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Hoping that you'd find your own way in
But how can I protect you, or try not to neglect you
When you won't take the love I have to give?
[Bridge]
Yeah, I bought me an illusion and I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams and I had to have them all
But, oh, the taste is never so sweet as what you'd believe it is
Well, I guess it never is, it's these prejudiced illusions
That pump the blood to the heart of the biz
[Solo 1]
[Verse 2]
You know, I never thought that it could take so long
You know I never knew how to be strong
Yeah, I let you shape me, but I feel as though you raped me
'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my song
So now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside
Seems, somehow, I've found the will to live
But how can I forget you, or try not to reject you
When we both know it takes time to forgive? Yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweetness is a virtue and you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you but my conscience always tells me "No"
You could sell your body on the street to anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside and bust your innocence open wide
[Chorus]
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no
[Guitar Solo 2]
[Verse 3]
Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour 'cause this road ain't  getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
"Better tame that boy, 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man"
Sweetheart, don't make me laugh, you's getting too big for your pants
And I think maybe you should cut out while you can
[Bridge]
You can use your illusion, let it take you where it may
We live and learn, and then, sometimes, it's best to walk away
Me, I'm just here hanging on, it's my only place to stay
At least for now, anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions just to throw them all away
[Guitar Solo 3]
[Verse 4]
I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy, so why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say?
Callin' off the dogs, a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you, I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page?
[Pre-Chorus]
Kindness is a treasure and it's one, towards me, you've seldom shown
So, I'll say it, for good measure, to all the ones like you, I've known;
Ya know I'd like to shave your head and all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me is a two-way street, an' all I really want is peace
[Chorus]
But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no
[Guitar Solo 4]
[Pre-Chorus]
Affection is a blessing, can you find it in your sordid heart?
I tried to keep this thing together but the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah, I know, it's hard to face when all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman and I'm such a stupid man
But love, like time, 's got its own plans
[Chorus]
But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track
My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no
Yeah, if love is blind, I guess I'll buy myself a cane
[Breakdown Solo 4]
[Outro]
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
Love's so strange
