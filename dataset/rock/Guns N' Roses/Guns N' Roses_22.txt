[Verse 1]
If we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?
No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
I was the one who was washing blood off your hands
[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
[Verse 2]
I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
With all the people talking, it's driving you mad
If I was standing by you, how would you feel
Knowing your love's decided, and all love is real? Yeah, baby
[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I thought I could live in your world as years all went by
With all the voices I've heard, something has died
And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby
[Chorus]
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight
And don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight, baby, maybe someday
Don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
