I know the shape you're in
It's a crown of thorns
It never seems to break the skin
There's no blood, there's no scars
And just your broken feet
You used to be so sweet
And you walked with a smile
The Ashtray's full and the coffee's cold
And the things you say... make you look so old
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Mirror talks to you
Nothing's ever good enough for you
[Chorus]
Sick of everything you say as you're goin' down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do as your going down
Look like a fool
Never meant to hurt no one
Just happened to be there next to you
As you were going down
I know this dark place
I heard these words
I've heard them before a million times
I've heard them yelled I've even heard them sung
Get into your car and drive just as fast as you can
You had your 15 minutes you tried to take an hour
Now No one needs your call
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got nothing good to say
Keep your mouth shut
Nothing good to do
Mirror talks to you
Nothing's ever good enough for you
[Chorus]
Sick of everything you say as you're goin' down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do as your going down
Look like a fool
Never meant to hurt no one
Just happened to be there next to you
As you were going down
As you're goin' down
As you're goin' down
Goin' down
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Sick of everything you say as you're goin' down
Sorry for everything
Sick of everything that you do as your going down
Look like a fool
Never meant to hurt no one
Just happened to be there next to you
As you were going down
As you were goin down, goin down
As you were goin down, goin down
As you were goin down, goin down
As you were goin down, goin down
Nothing's good enough for you
