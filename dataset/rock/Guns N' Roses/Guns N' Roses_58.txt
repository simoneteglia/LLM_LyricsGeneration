[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was around when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game
[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, haha
[Verse 3]
I watched with glee as your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, it was you and me
So let me, please, introduce myself
I'm the man of the wealth and taste (Oh yeah)
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, yeah
[Guitar Solo 1]
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah
[Verse 4]
Just as every cop's a criminal
And all the sinners' saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politics
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, oh
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah
[Guitar Solo 2]
Woo, who
Oh yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!
Tell me, baby, what's my name, oh
Tell me, honey, guess my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
I tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Ooo, who, who
Oh, yeah
What's my name
Tell me, baby, what's my name
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name
Ooo, who, who
Oh, yeah
