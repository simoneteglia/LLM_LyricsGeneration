[Pre-Chorus]
No, ah-ah
Is it true
What they say of you?
[Chorus]
Gonna call the president
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the I.R.S
Gonna need the F.B.I
There's not anymore that I can do
[Verse 1]
All the reasons that you gave, I'd follow you
To when you'd lead and if that'd be the end of time, it's true
Wouldn't be the first time I've been wrong
Wouldn't be the last, I'm sure I've known
Through all the rumors, I could tell
Some things didn't work so well
Well, anyway, it feels the same
[Bridge]
When you first told me you were gone
So long ago, but I still held on
Through all the motions, the love, and the sex
And that's the truth, and here's the worst yet
Wouldn't even matter, the things that I'd say
You've made your mind up and gone, anyway
And there's no use now in dragging it on
Should've seen it coming all along
[Guitar Solo 1]
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it's true
Oh, I had my doubts of you
[Chorus]
Gonna call the president
Gonna call myself a private eye
Gonna need the I.R.S
Gonna get the F.B.I
Gonna make this a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it, baby, with your morning news
With a sweet hangover and the headlines, too, now
[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, ah
[Bridge]
I bet you think I'm doing this all for my health
I should've looked again, dated somebody else
Feeling like I've done way more than wrong
Feeling like I'm living inside of this song
Feeling like I'm just too tired to care
Feeling like I've done more than my share
Couldn't be the way that I've carried on
Like a broken record for so long
And I do
[Chorus]
Gonna call the president
Gonna call a private eye
Gonna get the I.R.S
Gonna need myself the F.B.I
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, what shall I do
If I gave my heart to you?
It's such a crime, you know it's true
[Guitar Solo 2]
[Chorus]
Gonna call the president
Gonna get myself a private eye
Ooh, gonna need the I.R.S
Gonna get the F.B.I
Gonna make it a federal case
Gonna wave it right down in your face
Read it, baby, with your morning news
With the sweet hangover and the headlines, too
[Outro]
There's not any more that I can do
