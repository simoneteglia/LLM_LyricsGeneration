[Chorus]
All this time I thought I had my eye on you
But now I know the things you did not want me to
Who am I to say what you should say or do?
If that was all you ever thought I meant to you
[Bridge]
I know you think you're bad but who's the mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
I know you think you're bad but who's the mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
I know you think you're bad but who's the mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
I know you think you're bad but who's the mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
I know you think you're bad but who's the mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
I know you think you're bad but who's the mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
I know you think you're bad but who's the mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
I know you think you're bad but who's your mac daddy (Yeah, hey, hey)
(Yeah, hey, hey) Who's the mac daddy?
(Yeah, hey, hey) Who's the mac daddy?
[Chorus]
All this time I thought I had my eye on you
But now I know the things you did not want me to
Who am I to tell you what to say or do
If that was all I ever thought I meant to you

All this time I thought I had my eye on you
But now I know the things you did not want me to
Who am I to say what you should say or do

All this time you thought I had my eye on you
But now you know the things I did not want you to
Who am I to tell you what to say or do
And now I know exactly what I meant to you
