[Verse 1]
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
[Verse 2]
And I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you (I don't have)
[Bridge]
Happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then
[Interlude]
Yep, we're fucked!
[Verse 3]
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
[Outro]
Oh
You, you, you, oh, oh
You, you, you, oh, oh
You, you, you, oh, oh
You, you, you, oh, oh
You, you, oh yeah
[Instrumental Outro]
