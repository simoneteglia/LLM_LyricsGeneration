1,2,1,2,3,4
[Verse 1]
Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind, some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to 6th in L.A
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way
Police and niggers, that's right, get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your gold chains today
Now, don't need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket, till then, won't you cut me some slack?
[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you, but you were much too high
Much too high, much too high, much too high, ow
[Verse 2]
Immigrants and faggots, they make no sense to me
They come to our country and think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini-Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many goddamn ways, it's all Greek to me
Well, some say I'm lazy, ooh, and others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to an end, I-I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
[Chorus]
You're one in a million, ooh, you're a shooting star
You're one in a million, babe, you know that you are
Maybe someday we'll see you, ooh, before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you, but you were much too high
Much too high, oh much too high yeah, much too high, oh no no
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Radicals and racists, don't point your finger at me
I'm a small-town white boy just trying to make ends meet
Don't need your religion, don't watch that much TV
Just making my living, baby, well, that's enough for me
[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you, but you were much too high
[Outro]
Much too high, yeah, ow
Much too high, much too high, much too high, yeah
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high, ow
Much too high
