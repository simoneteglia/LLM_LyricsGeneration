[Intro]
This is the song about your fucking mother
[Verse]
It ain't easy living like a gypsy
Telling you, honey, how it feels
I've been dreaming, floating downstream
And losing touch with all that's real
Whole lot of lover, keeping undercover
Never knowing where you been, oh yeah
You've been fading, always out parading
Keep in touch with mama kin
You always got your tail on the wag
Spitting fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out 'cause someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon
[Chorus 1]
It isn't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you got to say 'shee-it'
But don't forget to drop me a line
[Chorus 2]
Bald as an egg at eighteen
And working for your daddy's just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon
[Chorus 3]
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh no
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 1]
It ain't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you got to say 'shee-it'
But don't forget to drop me a line
[Chorus 2]
Bald as an egg at eighteen
And working for your daddy's just a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon
[Chorus 3]
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and sucking me, oh no, no, no, yeah
