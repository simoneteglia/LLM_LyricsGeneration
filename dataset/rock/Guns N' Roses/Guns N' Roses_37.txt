[Verse]
Daddy, don't
I swear I won't
I'll be good from now on
And I'm awful sorry
Daddy, don't
The hell I won't
I won't be good anymore
And you'll all be sorry
[Refrain]
Can anybody tell me why the pain
It just won't stop?
Can anybody help me?
This pain, it just won't stop
[Chorus]
My only regret
Is that I never took the time to forget
All those unspoken feelings
That were never spared
At those who understand
That love deserves respect
And not your sordid meaning
[Verse]
Daddy, don't
I swear I won't
I'll be good from now on
And I'm awful sorry
Daddy, don't
The hell I won't
I won't be good anymore
And you'll all be sorry
[Refrain]
Can anybody tell me why the pain
It just won't stop?
Can anybody help me?
This pain, it just won't stop
[Chorus]
My only regret
Is that I never took the time to forget
All those unspoken feelings
That were never spared
At those who understand
That love deserves respect
And not your sordid meaning
[Bridge]
Don't know what to tell you now
It's never really what they tell you, now
You oughta know what they tell you now
And not really what they tell you now
Don't know what to tell you now
It ain't really what they tell you, now
Don't go where they tell you, now
It ain't really what they tell you, now
[Chorus]
My only regret
Is that I never took the time to forget
All those unspoken feelings
That were never spared
At those who understand
That love deserves respect
And not your sordid meaning
[Outro]
Is that I never took the time to forget
