[Verse 1]
Perhaps I was wrong
When I didn't see you, hey, hey
Perhaps I was wrong, hey
Well, I don't believe you
[Pre-Chorus]
But how would I know how it feels
Or what it is to be you?
I've been so upset
Harboring this hate for days
[Verse 2]
Hey, my sense of rejection, hey, hey
Is no excuse for my behavior, hey
You pulled the gun, hey, hey
That shot and crucified my savior
[Pre-Chorus]
Now he is no more
And I am without you
Just like I was before
The way that I used to be, hey
What a weight upon your shoulders
That you don't need
My heart bleeds for me
[Chorus]
Got a lot more than I bargained for
You're all alone now
You forgot about the others you were fighting for
You're all alone
Sold out to the ones that you once ignored
You're all alone now
You used to be a little crazy, now there's so much more
You're all alone
[Solo]
[Verse 3]
Perhaps I was wrong, hey, hey
When I didn't see you, hey, hey
Perhaps I was wrong, hey
When I don't believe you
[Pre-Chorus]
But how would I know how it feels
Or what it is to be you?
I've been so upset
Harboring this hate for days
Oh, what a weight upon your shoulders
That you don't need
My heart bleeds for me
[Chorus]
Got a lot more than I bargained for
You're all alone now
You forgot about the others you were fighting for
You're all alone
Sold out to the ones that you once ignored
You're all alone now
You used to be a little crazy, now there's so much more
You're all alone
