[Intro]
Seems like forever and a day
[Verse 1]
If my intentions are misunderstood
Please be kind, I've done all I should
I won't ask of you what I would not do
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I saw the damage in you
My fortunate one, the envy of youth
[Chorus]
Why would they tell me to please those that laugh in my face?
When all of the reasons they've taught us fall over themselves to give way, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
It's not a question of whether my heart is true
Streamlined, I had to pull through
Look for a new beginning on you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I, I got a message for you, ooh
Up and away, it's what I got to do, ooh
Forgive what you have for what you might lose
[Chorus]
What would you say if I told you that I'm to blame?
And what would you do if I had to deny your name?
Where would you go if I told you I love you and then walked away? Oh, yeah
And who should I turn to if not for the ones that you could not save? Oh, now
[Bridge]
I told you when I found you
If there were doubts, you should be careful and unafraid
Now they surround you
And all that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
So, if my affections are misunderstood
And you decide I'm up to no good
Don't ask me to enjoy them just for you
[Chorus]
Ask yourself why I would choose to prostitute myself
To live with fortune and shame? Oh yeah
When you should have turned to the hearts
Of the ones that you would not save
[Bridge]
I told you when I found you
All that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain
[Guitar Solo]
