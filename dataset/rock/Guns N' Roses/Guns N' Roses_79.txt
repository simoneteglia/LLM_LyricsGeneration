[Chorus]
If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say
If the world would end and our love slipped away, ooh
[Verse 1]
I never knew the way that you look at me
Would ever mean so much to me
But in my heart, I found the feelings that I've never shown
And now they've got the best of me
[
Chorus
]
If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say
If the world would end and our love slipped away, ooh
[Bridge]
Ooh, la, da-da-da
La-da, da-da, da-da-da
Ooh, la, da-da-da
La-da, da-da, da-da-da
[Verse 2]
I never thought all the love I was looking for
Could ever be so close to me
But you're the only one I have ever loved that has ever loved me
And now you've got the best of me
[Chorus]
If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
If the world would end today
And all the dreams we had would all just drift away, ooh
You know, there's nothing more to say
If the world would end and our love slipped away, ooh
