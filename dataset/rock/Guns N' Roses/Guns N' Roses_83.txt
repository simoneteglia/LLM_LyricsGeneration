[Verse 1]
It's not as you're thinking, or as you've imagined
To live in the shade of beliefs that were fashioned
To leave you in slavery and drain out your soul
But what can I do when there's so many liars
That crawl through your veins like millions of spiders
That seek out their victims and who is the wiser?
Watch out
Gotcha
[squeal]
[Chorus]
Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
Like nobody wanted to know
[Verse 2]
So give it away like they're not gonna fuck you
How much can you beg them to come back and haunt you
To broadcast your feelings and cause you to suffer
You're starting to bleed
They don't discover before it's too late
What will you offer
In ways of healing, oh, I'm so confused
Abused
Misused
[Chorus]
Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to kill and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
'Cause nobody wanted to know
[Refrain]
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than a strong compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than the last compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shadows
If only you had let me know
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
And they won't give in 'cause they know what they're after
A kick in the face, like it's all that would matter
Oh
[Chorus]
Oh my god, I can't deny this
I've been taught just to murder and fight this
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it
'Cause nobody wanted to know
[Refrain]
Ooh, if it opens your eyes
Well, then it's better than a good compromise
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle
If only you had let me know
Ooh, well then it's on with the show
Like the tides out on the ocean
The wave's already set in motion
The only one in the game who's lost is you
