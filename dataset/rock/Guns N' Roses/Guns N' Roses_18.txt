[Verse 1]
I said, 'Baby, you been lookin' real good'
You know that I remember when we met
It's funny how I never felt so good
It's a feelin' that I know, I know I'll never forget
[Bridge]
Ooh, it was the best time I can remember
Ooh, and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever
[Verse 2]
There wasn't much in this heart of mine
There was a little left and babe you found it
It's funny how I never felt so high
It's a feeling that I know, I know I'll never forget
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it was the best time I can remember
Ooh, and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever
[Chorus]
I think about you, honey, all the time, my heart says, 'Yes'
I think about you, deep inside, I love you best
I think about you, you know you're the one I want
I think about you, darling, you're the only one
I think about you, yeah!
Hahaha!
[Post-Chorus]
I think about you, you know that I do
I think about you, all alone, only you
I think about you, ooh-oh, it's true
I think about you, oh, yes, I do
[Verse 3]
Somethin' changed in this heart of mine
You know that I'm so glad that you showed me
Honey, now you're my best friend
I wanna stay together 'til the very end
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it was the best time I can remember
Ooh, and the love we shared
Lovin' that'll last forever
[Chorus]
I think about you, honey, all the time, my heart says, 'Yes'
I think about you, deep inside, I love you best
I think about you, you know you're the one I want
I think about you, darling, you're the only one
[Outro]
I think about you, oh-oh yeah
I think about you, oh you
I think about you
Only you
I think about you, you know I do
I think about you, only you
I think about you
Only you
Only
You
Only
