[Intro: Duff McKagan]
One, two, one, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now
[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience, mm-mm, yeah
[Verse 2]
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now,
I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider
[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it, we won't fake it
Oh, I'll never break it 'cause I can't take it
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Little patience, mm, yeah, ooh, yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience
I've been walkin' the streets tonight (Yeah)
Just tryin' to get it right (Need some patience)
It's hard to see with so many around (Yeah)
You know I don't like bein' stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience)
And the streets don't change, but maybe the names (Yeah)
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (Gotta have more patience)
Yeah-yeah, but I need you (Yeah)
Ooh, I need you (All it takes is patience)
Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)
Ooh, this time (Is all you need)
Ah
