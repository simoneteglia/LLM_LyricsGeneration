[Verse 1]
All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, ocean's blue
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream
[Verse 2]
All the lights are sparkling for you it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
Like a boss, you sang jazz and blues
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice creams
[Verse 3]
The summer's wild and I've been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can't you see you're meant for me?
The summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to doubt your Medellín, tangerine dreams
[Bridge]
Catch me if you can, working on my tan
Salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain
Ciao, amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it's time to eat soft ice cream
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao amore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Soft ice cream
[Verse 1]
All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, ocean's blue
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream
[Verse 2]
All the lights are sparkling for you it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
