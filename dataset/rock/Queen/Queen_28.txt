[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
[Chorus]
(Please bring it back, back) Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me (means to me)
[Bridge]
You will remember when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me (means to me)
[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh
