[Verse 1]
Finally, I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly, that will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts
[Pre-Chorus]
This is my commitment, my modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us who never got the chance
For and for (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance
[Chorus]
Sometimes, it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)
[Verse 2]
Finally, gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of bein'
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was, I was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no more chasing rainbows and hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions, solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Shut up, shut up)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, yeah)
[Chorus]
Sometimes, it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I wanna get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do, I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)
[Post-Chorus]
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black) into the blue (Into the blue)
[Instrumental Outro]
