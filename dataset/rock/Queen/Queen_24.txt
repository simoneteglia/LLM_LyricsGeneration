[Intro: Lana Del Rey &
Mountain
]
Why? (
Got that?
)
Who? Me? (
Louder
)
Why? (
Got that?
)
[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey,
Mountain
]
Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (
Louder
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey,
Mountain
]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey,
Mountain
]
Lost, but now I am found
I can see that, once, I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (
Louder
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey,
Mountain
]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
[Post-Chorus]
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
[Pre-Chorus]
So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey,
Mountain
]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (
Louder, alright
)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
