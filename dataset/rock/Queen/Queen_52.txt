[Intro: Harvey Keitel &

Ms. Third Ward
,
your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be
To be happy
[Verse 1]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"
[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down
[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
[Verse 2]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South Beach, sugar-free
Vogue says thinner is better
[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time, I'm gonna take the crown
Without fallin' down, down, down
[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
(Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery
[Bridge]
Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's my soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past
[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst (Pretty hurts)
Perfection is a disease of a nation
(Pretty hurts)
Pretty hurts (Pretty hurts)
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something (Pretty hurts)
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery
[Outro]
When you're alone all by yourself (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
And you're lyin' in your bed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Reflection stares right into you (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
You stripped away the masquerade (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
The illusion has been shed (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts)
Yeah, yes
(Ah, ah, ah)
