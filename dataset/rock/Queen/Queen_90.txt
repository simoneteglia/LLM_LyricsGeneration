[Verse 1]
My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California, too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby, too
[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
[Chorus]
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
[Verse 2]
My baby lives in shades of cool
Cold heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, Bonnie's blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new
[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
[Chorus]
'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
[Bridge]
Your hot, hot weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling
[Chorus]
You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
[Outro]
Pa pa da pa
Pa pa da ah, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
[Verse 1]
My baby lives in shades of blue

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
[Chorus]
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Your hot, hot weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling
[Chorus]
You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
[Outro]
Pa pa da pa
Pa pa da ah, oh
Oh, oh
