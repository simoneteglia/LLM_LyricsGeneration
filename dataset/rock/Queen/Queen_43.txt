[Video Prelude]
[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons,
Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes" (Yes, yes)
[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
[Post-Chorus]
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact (Kiss, kiss)
[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(
"Yes, of course I will, my darling"
)
[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin',
overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon
[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
[Outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
