[Verse 1]
Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you
[Pre-Chorus]
You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love
[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
[Post-Chorus]
(Mic-check)
(One, two)
(Two, two)
(Get it, girl)
[Verse 2]
Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock 'n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
[Pre-Chorus]
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love
[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
[Outro]
I'm in love
I'm in love
