[Verse 1]
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singing
[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
[Verse 2]
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place
[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you (Sing it out)
We will, we will rock you
[Verse 3]
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place
[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm
We will, we will rock you, alright
