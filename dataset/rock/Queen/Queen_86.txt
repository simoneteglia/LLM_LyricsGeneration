[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
[Verse 2]
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside, my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
[Verse 3]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
[Verse 4]
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning)
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (Turning, turning, turning)
Round the corner now
Outside, the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark, I'm aching to be free
[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah, yeah
Ooh, inside, my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
[Break]
Yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah, oh woah
[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends
[Chorus]
The show must go on, eh (Go on, go on, go on)
The show must go on (Go on, go on, go on)
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show
[Outro]
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
(On with the show, on with the show)
Show
(The show must go on)
[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
[Verse 2]
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside, my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
[Verse 3]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on

Show
(The show must go on)
