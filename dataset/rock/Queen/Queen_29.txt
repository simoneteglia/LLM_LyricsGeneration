[Verse 1]
She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Ooh, ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Caviar
and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
[Verse 2]
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're
that way inclined
[Pre-Chorus]
Perfume came naturally from Paris
(Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussycat (Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you
[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try
