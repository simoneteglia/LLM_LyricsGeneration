[Verse 1]
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise
[Pre-Chorus]
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
[Post-Chorus]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows
[Pre-Chorus]
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
[Bridge]
Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh yeah)
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
[Outro]
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, ahh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise
[Pre-Chorus]
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
[Chorus]
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
[Post-Chorus]
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah
[Verse 2]
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row

We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
[Outro]
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh

Ooh, ahh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, oh yeah
