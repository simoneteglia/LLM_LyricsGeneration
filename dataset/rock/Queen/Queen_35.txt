[Verse 1]
Love (
Yeah
), I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger (
Hey
)
'Cause you just want it so much
[Verse 2]
A touch (
Yeah
), from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil (
Hey
)
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (Fuck)
[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (
Hey
) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined
[Verse 3]
Love (
Yeah
), is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against ya (
Hey
)
And you just stay lined up, yeah (Fuck)
[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Bitch; Lookin' at me like a magazine)
[Bridge]
My rose garden dreams (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Set on fire by fiends (Sippin' on ya like a Coca-Cola)
And all my black beaches (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Lookin' at me like a magazine)
My celluloid scenes (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are torn at the seams (Sippin' on ya like a Coca-Cola, yeah)
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
(
Yeah
) I fall to pieces when I'm with you
[Outro]
(Why?)
'Cause I love you so much (
Hey
)
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (
Yeah
)
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck)
[Verse 1]
Love (

Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
