[Verse 1]
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun
[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't wanna be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't wanna get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin"
[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
[Verse 2]
Carmen, Carmen, stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen
[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "You don't wanna be like me
Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't wanna get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tirin', tirin'"
[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
[Bridge]
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relyin' on the kindness of strangers
Tyin' cherry knots, smilin', doin' party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again
[Interlude]
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi
[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
Like lightning, oh-oh
Like lightning
[Outro]
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
[Verse 1]
Darlin', darlin' doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having fun

She says, "You don't wanna get this way

Lyin', I'm lyin"
[Chorus]
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
