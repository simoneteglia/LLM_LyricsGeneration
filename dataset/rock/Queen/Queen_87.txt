[Intro]
L.A., L.A.​
L.A., L.A.​
[Verse 1]
In the land of
gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing
[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees
and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
[Verse 2]
In the land of
gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to
get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art
[Pre-Chorus]
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"
[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees
and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
[Bridge]
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard
[Chorus]
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees
and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
