[Verse 1]
All my friends tell me  I should move on
I'm lyin' in the ocean, singin' your song
"Ah," That's how you sang it
Lovin' you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
"Ah," That's how we played it
[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is hauntin' me
And tellin' me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead like you)
[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
[Verse 2]
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em, "When you find true love, it lives on"
Ah, that's why I stay here
[Pre-Chorus]
And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is hauntin' me
And tellin' me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead like you)
[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
[Bridge]
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushin' me
But I can feel you touchin' me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Tellin' me I'm fine
[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (So tell me)
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
[Verse 1]
All my friends tell me  I should move on
I'm lyin' in the ocean, singin' your song

"Ah," That's how we played it

Your soul is hauntin' me

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
[Verse 2]

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
