[Part I]
[Verse 1]
I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair, and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?
[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter
[Chorus]
Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore
[Verse 2]
Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files
wasn't on
Watching
Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this
[Pre-Chorus]
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter
[Chorus]
Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
[Verse 3]
I mean, look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
Got a cop who turned on the backbeat
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now
[Chorus]
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore (Oh, okay)
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
[Part II]
[Intro]
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
Woo
[Chorus]
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high (Oh my god)
Love me if you love or not, you can be my light
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time
[Post-Chorus]
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time
[Chorus]

Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time

Jimmy, you should switch it up, baby, light it up (Yeah)
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like)
Jimmy, if you switch it up, you should light it up
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like, surf's up)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time
But I don't care, baby, I already lost my mind
Jimmy, if I lie it up, find me in the club (Mind, mind)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fucking up big time
[Chorus]
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high
Love me if you love or not, you can be my light
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
