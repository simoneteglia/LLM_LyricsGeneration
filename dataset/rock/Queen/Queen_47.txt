[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
[Verse 1]
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me
[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)
[Verse 2]
Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will, some day, rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf
[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)
[Bridge]
Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater
(Summertime)
(Ah, ah, ah)
[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
[Chorus]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
