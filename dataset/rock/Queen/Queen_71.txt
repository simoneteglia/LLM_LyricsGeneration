[Intro]
Yee-haw
Ooh
Texas, Texas (Ooh) Texas
[Verse 1]
Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand (Ooh)
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And oh, that's when he gave to me
[Chorus]
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Yee, woo
Ooh
Yee-haw (Woo)
[Verse 2]
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, "Girl, it's your second amendment" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, "Remember..."
[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
That's when Daddy looked at me
[Chorus]
With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Woo)
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Woo)
Ooh (Woo)
Ooh (Yee)
Ooh (Yee-haw)
[Outro: Beyoncé &
Blue Ivy Carter

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you" (Ooh)
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you (Ooh)
'Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
"'Cause when trouble comes to town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Good job, Bey
