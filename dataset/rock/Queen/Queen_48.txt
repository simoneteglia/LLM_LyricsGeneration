[Verse 1]
Fear fun, fear love
Fresh out of fucks forever
Tryin' to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen
I dream in jeans and leather
Live stream, I'm sweet for you
[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made
[Verse 2]
Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers
It's just me and you
[Chorus]
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
[Post-Chorus]
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made
[Refrain]
Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
[Chorus]
Oh God, want you on my lips (I do, I do)
It's me, your little Venice bitch (Yes, it is)
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
[Refrain]
Oh, shatter (Yeah), oh, shatter (Yeah, yeah), oh, shatter (Yeah)
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Yeah (Yeah), oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah)
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
[Chorus]
Oh God, I love him on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
Touch me with your fingertips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
[Verse 4]
Back, back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover
[Bridge]
(La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers)

Back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds

If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
