[Verse 1]
That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
[Verse 2]
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone
[Chorus]
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
[Bridge]
Strobe lights
And blown speakers
Fireworks
And hurricanes
[Chorus]
I'm not here
This isn't happenin'
I'm not here
I'm not here
[Outro]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ahh
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
