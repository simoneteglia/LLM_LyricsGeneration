[Intro]
(Turn it up, loud! Bring it up!)
[Verse 1]
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood'll thicken
[Verse 2]
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?
[Chorus]
My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no
[Post-Chorus]
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
[Verse 3]
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high
[Chorus]
My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
[Post-Chorus]
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would...
[Bridge]
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race, race, race, race
[Outro]
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
