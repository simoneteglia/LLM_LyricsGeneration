[Verse 1]
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with whys
[Verse 2]
I'm movin' out of orbit
(Turnin' in somersaults)
Turnin' in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(Jellyfish float by)
Jellyfish float by
[Outro]
It's what keeps me alive
