[Verse 1]
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Stirring up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I... was bulletproof
[Verse 2]
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it
[Chorus]
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof
[Verse 3]
So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead, fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate
[Chorus]
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof
