[Verse 1]
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave
[Verse 2]
I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave
[Verse 3]
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
[Chorus]
Just don't leave
Don't leave
