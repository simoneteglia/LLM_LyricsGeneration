[Verse 1]
I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie
[Verse 2]
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
[Verse 3]
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
[Outro]
The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids
