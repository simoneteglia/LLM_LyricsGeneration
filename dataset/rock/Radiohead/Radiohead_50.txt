[Verse 1]
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off
[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
[Chorus 1]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast balloonin' head
Listen to your heart
[Verse 2]
We will shrink and then be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
[Refrain]
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
[Bridge]
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Oh, the
bird that's flown into my room
[Chorus 2]
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast balloonin' head
Listen to your heart
