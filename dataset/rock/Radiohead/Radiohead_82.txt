[Chorus 1]
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hangin' from the trees
Fallin' off the giant bird that's been carryin' me
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
[Verse 1]
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart in my mouth
[Chorus 2]
Like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
[Verse 2]
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
[Chorus 3]
(Did so much, did so much)
Fallen off a giant bird that's been carryin' me
[Verse 3]
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off, lost your number
I wanna slip over and get back under
[Bridge]
And if you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) If you think this is over, then you're wrong
(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) If you think this is over, then you're wrong
[Chorus 2]
(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) Like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
(Wake me up, will you wake me up?) Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carryin'
[Outro]
When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
