[Verse 1]
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
[Verse 2]
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way out)
Is my chance
[Chorus]
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
[Outro]
Yeah, I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
