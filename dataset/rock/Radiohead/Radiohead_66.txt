[Verse 1]
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
[Bridge]
Four, five, six, seven
[Verse 2]
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
[Bridge]
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
[Outro]
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
