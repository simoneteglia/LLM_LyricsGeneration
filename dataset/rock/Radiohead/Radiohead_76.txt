[Verse 1]
After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize
[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
[Post-Chorus]
After years of waiting
[Verse 2]
After years of waiting, nothing came
And you realize you're looking in, looking in the wrong place
[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
[Interlude]
(I'mma try for...)
After years of waiting
[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
