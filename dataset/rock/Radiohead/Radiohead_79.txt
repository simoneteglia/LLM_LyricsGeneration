[Verse 1]
Been thinking about you
Your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall
Your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one
And you're now a star
What do you care?
[Verse 2]
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Shit, I still love you
Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care when the other men are far, far better?
[Chorus]
All the things you've got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?
[Verse 3]
I've been thinking about you
So how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends
They're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
And why should you care, when I'm not there?
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
Been thinking about you
And there's no rest
Shit, I still love you
Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself
And what do you care, when I'm not there?
[Chorus]
All the things you've got
That you'll never need
All the things you've got
I've bled and I bleed to please you
[Outro]
Been thinking about you
