[Verse 1]
I'm the next act waiting in the wings
I'm an animal trapped in your hot car
I am all the days that you choose to ignore
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Verse 2]
I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Outro]
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's alright,  it's alright,  it's alright
It's all wrong,  it's alright
It's alright,  it's alright
