[Verse 1]
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
[Refrain]
Release me
Release me
[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howlin' down the chimney
[Refrain]
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me
[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the
Furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round
[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
[Outro]
The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a friend
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
Walkin', walkin', walkin', walkin'
