[Verse 1]
There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
There are weapons we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you talk the war games
[Chorus]
Oh why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)
[Verse 2]
You don't live in a business world and
He never goes and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
All over, baby's crying
It'll all be, baby, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the
[Chorus]
(Quiet down)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents
