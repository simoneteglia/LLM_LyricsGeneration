[Verse 1]
The Moonies are up on the mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing,
"We're here
To keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail”
Together, together
[Verse 2]
You made a pig's ear
You made a rude mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
[Verse 3]
Where's the truth? What's the use?
In hanging around, lost and found
With your head in the sand
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you’ve no right
Fast and loose, win or lose
Jumped the queue, go back again
President for life
Lord of all that flies in the sky
The beasts of the earth, the fish in the sea
You’ve lost command
[Outro]
Hey hey, hey hey hey
Uh uh, uh uh uh
Uh uh uh
