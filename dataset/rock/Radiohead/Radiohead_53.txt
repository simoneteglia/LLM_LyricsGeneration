[Verse 1]
I get home from work
And you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well, what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you
[Pre-Chorus 1]
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
[Verse 2]
The troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake, but it's fifty-eight hours
Since that I last slept with you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
[Verse 3]
I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
When I see a face like you
[Pre-Chorus 3]
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down
[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
[Outro]
Ah, this is killing me
Ah, this is killing me
