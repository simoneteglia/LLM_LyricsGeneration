[Verse 1]
I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote
[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet

[Verse 2]
Riot shields,
voodoo economics, your turn, your turn
It's just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F
I trust I can rely on your vote
[Chorus]
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
