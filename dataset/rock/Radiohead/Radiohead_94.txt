[Verse 1]
Are you hungry, are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet, are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?
[Hook 1]
We want the young blood
[Verse 2]
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten, moth eaten?
[Hook 2]
We suck young blood
We suck young blood
[Verse 3]
Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned
[Hook 3]
We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood
