[Verse 1]
Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure
[Verse 2]
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings
[Chorus]
Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)
Because we separate like ripples on a blank shore
(In rainbows)
[Verse 3]
Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings
