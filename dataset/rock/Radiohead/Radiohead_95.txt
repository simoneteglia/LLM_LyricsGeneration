[Verse 1]
Don't turn nasty now, the dusts of Hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell
[Chorus 1]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been 'round you've been around enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh
[Verse 2]
The glue won't hold, the thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal
[Bridge]
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
The drug that will kill you
Kill you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you
[Chorus 2]
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
I'm no idiot, I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
