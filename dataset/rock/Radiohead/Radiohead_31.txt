[Verse 1]
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
[Chorus]
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
And fall off the table, get swept under
Denial, denial
[Verse 2]
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'
[Chorus]
And forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table, get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
(Your ears should be burning)
Denial, denial
(Your ears should be burning)
