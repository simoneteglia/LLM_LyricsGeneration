[Verse 1]
Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glasshouse
[Verse 2]
And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses
[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in
[Verse 3]
Once again we are hungry for a lynching
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glasshouse
[Chorus]
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
[Bridge]
Only only only only
Only only only only
Only only only only
Only only only only
[Outro]
There's someone listening in
