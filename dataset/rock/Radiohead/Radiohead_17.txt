[Verse 1]
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
[Verse 2]
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
[Chorus]
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
[Outro]
I will see you in the next life
