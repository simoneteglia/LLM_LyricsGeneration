[Verse 1]
If you're in a forest, out of your mind
Harpies in the branches breaking your arms
If you're stuck in rainbows, shattering glass
Where you miss the moment, watching it pass
[Chorus]
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
[Verse 2]
When you spend your life wishing on a twinkling star
When you forget how lucky you are
Buried in rubble, sixty foot down
[Chorus]
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running
[Bridge]
When you change your friends like changing your clothes
[Chorus]
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running
I'll come running
