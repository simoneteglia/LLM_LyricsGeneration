[Verse 1]
Karma police, arrest this man
,
he talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge, he's like a detuned radio
[Verse 2]
Karma police, arrest this girl, her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
and we have crashed her party
[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us
[Verse 3]
Karma police, I've given all I can, it's not enough
I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll
[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us
[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
