[Verse 1]
You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk, you sit there and bawl
You look so pretty when you're on your knees
Disinfected and eager to please
[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
[Verse 2]
Each time it comes, it eats me alive
I try to behave, but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away
[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
