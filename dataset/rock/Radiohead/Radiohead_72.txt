[Verse 1]
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
[Chorus]
And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me
there
you'll get
relief, relief
Relief, relief
[Verse 2]
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get
relief, relief
Relief, relief
Relief, relief
[Outro]
It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
