[Verse 1]
I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for
The birds, the birds
The birds
[Verse 2]
You want me?
Fuckin' well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
[Verse 3]
You want me?
Well, come on and break the door down
You want me?
Fuckin' come on and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
