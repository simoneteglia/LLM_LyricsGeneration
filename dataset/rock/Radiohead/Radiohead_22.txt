[Verse 1]
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up
This is a low-flying panic attack
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes
[Chorus]
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
[Verse 2]
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low-flying panic attack
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
[Chorus]
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
