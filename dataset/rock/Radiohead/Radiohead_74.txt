[Intro]
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
[Verse 1]
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight
[Chorus]
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah
[Verse 2]
Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round, you stay frozen to the spot
[Chorus]
The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah
[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
