[Verse 1]
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body
[Verse 2]
Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body
[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
[Bridge]
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
[Chorus 2]
May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
