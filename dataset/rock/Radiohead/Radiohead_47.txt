[Verse 1]
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when you lock me out
I promise
I'll say my prayers every night
I promise
[Verse 2]
I know which side I'm spread
I promise
The tantrums and the chitty chats
I promise
[Chorus]
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotten deck
I promise
[Verse 3]
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
[Chorus]
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotten deck
I promise
[Outro]
I won't run away no more
I promise
