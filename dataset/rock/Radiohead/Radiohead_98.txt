[Verse 1]
We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting
[Verse 2]
This far, but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets, so full of sleep
I'm backsliding
[Chorus]
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
[Verse 3]
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
[Post-Chorus]
You fell into our, you fell into our...
[Verse 1]
We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters
