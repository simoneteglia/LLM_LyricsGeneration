[Verse 1]
I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees, and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
[Chorus]
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
[Verse 2]
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers
[Chorus]
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
[Bridge]
And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
[Outro]
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones
Ah, ah, ah
