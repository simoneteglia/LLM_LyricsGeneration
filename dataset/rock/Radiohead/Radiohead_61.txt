[Verse 1]
I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think, I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think
[Pre-Chorus]
Open up, begin again
[Chorus]
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back
[Verse 2]
What would I do? What would I do?
If I did not have you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Open up and let me in
[Chorus]
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all, nothing at all
[Outro]
Keep it moving
Keep it moving
Ah, ah
Ah
