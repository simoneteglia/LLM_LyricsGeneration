[Verse 1]
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back
[Chorus]
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth
[Verse 2]
If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
[Chorus]
So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
[Verse 3]
I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste
[Chorus]
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
