[Verse 1]
In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak
[Chorus]
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
[Verse 2]
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
[Chorus]
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
[Interlude]
There, there
[Outro 1]
Why so
green
and lonely, and lonely
And lonely
Heaven sent you to me, to me
To me
[Outro 2]
We are accidents waiting, waiting
To happen
We are accidents waiting, waiting
To happen
