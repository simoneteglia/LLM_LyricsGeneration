[Verse 1]
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy?
Well, come on, come on
[Refrain]
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
[Verse 2]
Come on, come on
Holy Roman Empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on
[Refrain]
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
[Outro]
You forget so easy
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
