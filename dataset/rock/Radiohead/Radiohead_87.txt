Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up

Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down)
Walk into the jaws of hell (stand up)

Hey, we can wipe you out anytime (stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down)
Anytime
Anytime
[Interlude]
Stand up
Sit down

The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
