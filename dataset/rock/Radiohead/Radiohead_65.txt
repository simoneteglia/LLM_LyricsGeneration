[Verse 1]
Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone
[Verse 2]
When you come home I’ll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill
[Chorus]
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and
poisoned dwarves
[Chorus]
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
For you, big boots
