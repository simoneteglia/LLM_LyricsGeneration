[Verse 1]
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
[Pre-Chorus 1]
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
[Verse 2]
Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
[Pre-Chorus 2]
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self
[Outro]
(You do it to yourself!)
(You do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)
