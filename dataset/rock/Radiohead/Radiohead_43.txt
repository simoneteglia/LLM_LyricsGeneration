[Verse 1]
It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin
No one else would know
[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second
[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down
