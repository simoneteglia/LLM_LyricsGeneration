[Verse 1]
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing
[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
[Verse 2]
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
[Pre-Chorus]
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
[Bridge]
Let down again
Let down again
Let down again
[Verse 3]
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
[Pre-Chorus]
And one day
I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and useless
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and
(You know where you are)
[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
