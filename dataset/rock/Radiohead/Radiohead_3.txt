[Verse 1]
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
[Chorus]
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
[Verse 2]
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
[Verse 3]
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Get me out of here)
