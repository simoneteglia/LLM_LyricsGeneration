[Verse 1]
Destiny, destiny, protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world
[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere
[Chorus]
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore
[Verse 2]
Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison
[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere
[Chorus]
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore
