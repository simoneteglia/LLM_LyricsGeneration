[Verse 1]
All the holes at once
Are comin' alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey
[Chorus]
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes
[Verse 2]
All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here, come to me before it's too late
[Chorus]
The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes
