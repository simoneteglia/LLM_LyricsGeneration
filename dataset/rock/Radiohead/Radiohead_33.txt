[Verse 1]
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day
[Chorus]
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
[Verse 2]
The head of state
Has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change
[Chorus]
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
We are standing on the edge
