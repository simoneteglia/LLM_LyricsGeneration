[Verse 1]
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying
[Chorus]
Everything is
Broken
Everyone is
Broken
[Verse 2]
You can force it but it will stay stone
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still
[Chorus]
Everything is
Broken
Everyone is
Broken
Everyone is
Everyone is broken
Everyone is
Everything is broken
[Outro]
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
