[Intro: Paul McCartney]
(One, two, three)
[Refrain:
John Lennon
]
I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you
[Verse 1: John Lennon,
John Lennon & Paul McCartney
]
And now and then
If we must start again
Well, we will know for sure
That I will
love you
[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
Always to return to me
[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if you go away
I know you'll never stay
[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
[Bridge: George Harrison]
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ooh)

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you
