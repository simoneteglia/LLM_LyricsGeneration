[Verse 1]
Hey, Jude,
don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
[Verse 2]
Hey, Jude,
don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
[Bridge]
And anytime you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
[Verse 3]
Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey, Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
[Bridge]
So let it out and let it in, hey, Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey, Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, yeah
[Verse 4]
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
