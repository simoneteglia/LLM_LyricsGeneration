[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to arise
[Verse 2]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to be free
[Chorus]
Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light
Of a dark, black night
Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light
Of a dark, black night
[Verse 3]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to arise
[Outro]
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to arise
[Verse 2]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to be free
[Chorus]
Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light
Of a dark, black night
Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the light
Of a dark, black night
[Verse 3]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life, you were only waiting
For this moment to arise
[Outro]
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise
