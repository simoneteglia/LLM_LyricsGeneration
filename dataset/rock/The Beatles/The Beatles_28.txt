[Intro]
Oh
[Verse 1]
Flew in from Miami Beach, B.O.A.C
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.​
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R.​
[Verse 2]
Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it 'till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone
[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.​
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.​
Back in the U.S.​
Back in the U.S.S.R.​
[Bridge]
(Well) The Ukraine girls really knock me out
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Oh, come on!
[Guitar Solo]
Hoo, hey
Hoo, hey, hoo-hoo, yeah
Yeah-yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.​
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.​
[Bridge]
(Well) The Ukraine girls really knock me out
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
[Verse 3]
Oh, show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down South
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
[Chorus]
I'm back in the U.S.S.R. (Hey)
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R.​
[Outro]
Oh-oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R.​ (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Hey, it's so good to be home (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R.​
