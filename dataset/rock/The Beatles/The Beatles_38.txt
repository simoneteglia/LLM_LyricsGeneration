[Intro]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
[Verse 1]
(Love) There's nothing you can do that can't be done
(Love) Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
(Love) Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
[Verse 2]
(Love)
Nothing you can make that can't be made
(Love) No one you can save that can't be saved
(Love) Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy
[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
[Bridge]
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
[Verse 3]
(Love) There's nothing you can know that isn't known
(Love) Nothing you can see that isn't shown
(Love) There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
[Chorus]
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
[Outro – Fading]
All you need is love

All together now

All you need is love
