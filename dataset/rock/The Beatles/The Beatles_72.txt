[Verse 1]
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
[Verse 2]
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
[Chorus]
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
[Outro]
Oh, 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round
Oh, 'round, 'round, 'round...
[Verse 1]
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool

[Chorus]

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
[Verse 2]
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round

And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
[Chorus]
The fool on the hill

Oh, 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round
Oh, 'round, 'round, 'round...
