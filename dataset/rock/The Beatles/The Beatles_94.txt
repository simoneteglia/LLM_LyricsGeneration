[Intro: John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start that you
Would love me more than her
[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
If I trust in you, oh, please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh, please
Don't hurt my pride like her
[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
So, I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
So, I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
