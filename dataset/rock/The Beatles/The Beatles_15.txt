[Verse 1]
Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, “Girl, I like your face”
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
[Verse 2]
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store (Choo-choo-choo)
Buys a twenty-karat golden ring (Ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (Sing)
[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah (La-la-la-la-la)
La-la, how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah (La-la-la-la-la)
La-la, how their life goes on
Yeah
[Bridge]
In a couple of years, they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
[Verse 3]
Happy ever after in the marketplace
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening, she still sings it with the band
Yes!
[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on (Heh-heh)
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
[Bridge]
In a couple of years, they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Yeah!
[Verse 4]
Happy ever after in the marketplace
Molly lets the children lend a hand (Foot)
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening, she's a singer with the band (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da
Life goes on, brah
La-la, how their life goes on
[Outro]
(Ha-ha-ha-ha) And if you want some fun (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Take Ob-la-di-bla-da
Ahh, thank you
