[Verse 1]
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Till I get to the bottom, and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[Bridge]
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
(Aaaaah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer (Aaaaaaaaah)
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer (Dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer)
[Chorus]
Now, Helter-skelter
Helter-skelter
Helter-skelter
Yeah
Woo
[Bridge]
Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you?
(Aaaah)
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you (Aaaaaaaaah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer (Dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer)
[Chorus]
Look out
Helter-skelter
Helter-skelter
Helter-skelter
Ooh
Look out
'Cause here she comes
[Verse 2]
(Aaaaaaaaah)
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom, and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
Well, do you, don't you want me to make you? (Aaaah)
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you (Aaaaaaaaah)
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer (Dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer-dancer)
[Chorus]
Look out
Helter-skelter
Helter-skelter
Helter-skelter
[Outro]
Well look out, helter-skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes, she is
Yes, she is
Coming down fast
Oh, yeah, Helter Skelter
Woo

[Spoken: Ringo Starr]
I got blisters on my fingers
[Verse 1]
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Till I get to the bottom, and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
