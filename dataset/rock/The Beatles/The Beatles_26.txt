[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
[Chorus]
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
[Verse 2]
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner, aaah
[Bridge]
Dan, dan, dan, dan-dan
Dan, dan, dan, dan-dan
Dan, dan, dan, dan-dan
Dan, dan, dooroo-do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
[Verse 3]
Now, the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better,
I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
[Chorus]
Now, Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible (Oh, dou-dou-dou)
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt (Oooh Rocky, oooh)
To help with good Rocky's revival, aah
Yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
C'mon, Rocky boy
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
C'mon, Rocky boy
Do-do-do, dooroo-do-do
Do-dooroo-do-do, do-do
Yeah, c'mon, let's Rocky it!
