[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
'Till they find there's no need (There's no need)
[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away (Uuuuh)
And after all, I'm only sleeping
[Break]
[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
[Verse 3]
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
[Backwards Guitar Solo: George Harrison]
[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
[Break: John Lennon,
Paul McCartney
]
Yawn,
Paul
!
*Yawns*
[Bridge]
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
[Verse 4]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
(Uuuh, uuuuh)
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
[Verse 1]
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
[Chorus 1]
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
[Verse 2]
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
'Till they find there's no need (There's no need)
[Chorus 2]
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away (Uuuuh)
And after all, I'm only sleeping
