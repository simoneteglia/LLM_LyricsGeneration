[Intro: Paul McCartney &
John Lennon
]
Rosetta...
Sweet Loretta Fart she thought she was a cleaner
But she was a frying pan
Sweet Rosetta Martin... Rosetta
The picker, the picker, picture the fingers burning
Ooh
Okay
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass
[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo
[Electric Piano Solo: Billy Preston]
[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back
Yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back
Get back
Get back to where you once belonged
[Outro: Paul McCartney &
John Lennon
]
Get back
Ooh
Thanks, Mo
