[Verse 1]
We were talking—about the space between us all
And the people—who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth—then it's far too late—when they pass away
[Verse 2]
We were talking—about the love we all could share—when we find it
To try our best to hold it there—with our love
With our love—we could save the world—if they only knew
[Chorus]
Try to realise it's all within yourself, no one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small, and life flows on within you and without you
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
We were talking—about the love that's gone so cold
and the people
Who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know—they can't see, are you one of them?
[Chorus]
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one, and life flows on within you and without you
[Outro]
