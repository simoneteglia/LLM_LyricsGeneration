[Verse 1: John Lennon &
John Lennon & Paul McCartney
]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
[Verse 2: John Lennon &
John Lennon & Paul McCartney
]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on Earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah!
[Verse 1: John Lennon &

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Ah!
