[Verse 1: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
[Verse 2: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
[Chorus: John Lennon &
Paul McCartney
]
Nowhere man, please listen
(
Aah, la, la, la
)
You don't know what you're missing
(
Aah, la, la, la
)
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
(
Aah, la, la, la, la, la
)
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all?
[Chorus: John Lennon &
Paul McCartney
]
Nowhere man, don't worry
(
Aah, la, la, la
)
Take your time, don't hurry
(
Aah, la, la, la
)
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
(
Aah, la, la, la, la, la
)
