[Intro: Paul McCartney &
George Harrison
]
One, two, three, four
One, two—
(One, two, three, four!)
[Verse 1]
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
[Verse 2]
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful, I don't take it all
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
[Bridge]
(If you drive a car, car) I'll tax the street
(If you try to sit, sit) I'll tax your seat
(If you get too cold, cold) I'll tax the heat
(If you take a walk, walk) I'll tax your feet
Taxman
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
[Verse 3]
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Haha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Haha, Mr. Heath)
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
[Verse 4]
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman!)
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
[Outro]
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)
