[Chorus]
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
[Verse 1]
Little darling
It’s been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here
[Chorus]
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
[Verse 2]
Little darling
The smile's returning to the faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here
[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
[Verse 3]
Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear
[Chorus]
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
It's alright
It's alright
[Chorus]
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
[Verse 1]
Little darling
It’s been a long, cold, lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here
[Chorus]
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
[Verse 2]
Little darling
The smile's returning to the faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here
[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
[Verse 3]
Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear
[Chorus]
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
And I say, "It's alright"
Here comes the sun (Doo-d-doo-doo)
Here comes the sun
It's alright
It's alright
