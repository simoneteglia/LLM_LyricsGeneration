[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow, I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my lovin' to you
[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my lovin' to you
[Chorus: Paul McCartney &
George Harrison & John Lennon
]
All my lovin' (
Ooh
), I will send to you
All my lovin' (
Ooh
), darlin', I'll be true
[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow, I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my lovin' to you
[Chorus: Paul McCartney &
George Harrison & John Lennon
]
All my lovin' (
Ooh
), I will send to you
All my lovin' (
Ooh
), darlin', I'll be true, huh

All my lovin' (
Ooh
