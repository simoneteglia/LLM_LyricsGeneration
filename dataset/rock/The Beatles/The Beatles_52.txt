[Intro: Paul McCartney]
To lead a better life, I need my love to be here
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her—
[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me, I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her—
[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
[Outro: Paul McCartney]
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
