[Part I: The Dirty Old Man – 00:00-00:43]
[Verse 1: John Lennon,
John Lennon & Paul McCartney
]
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust
[Part II: The Junkie – 00:43-01:35]

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
(
Down
)
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
Mother Superior jumped the gun
[Part III: The Gunman (Satire of '50s R&R) – 01:35-02:45]
[Chorus]
Happiness is a warm gun
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, mama
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
[Verse 3]
When I hold you in my arms
(Ooh, oh, yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger
(Ooh, oh, yeah)
I know nobody can do me no harm
(Ooh, oh, yeah)
Because
[Outro]
(Happiness) Is a warm gun, mama
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes, it is
(Bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Happiness is a warm, yes, it is, gun
(Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun, mama?
(Is a warm gun, yeah)
