[Intro: John Lennon,
Paul McCartney & George Harrison
]
(
Help
) I need somebody
(
Help
) Not just anybody
(
Help
) You know I need someone
(
Help!
)
[Verse 1: John Lennon]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
[Chorus: John Lennon
with Paul McCartney & George Harrison
]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
[Verse 2: John Lennon]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
[Chorus: John Lennon
with Paul McCartney & George Harrison
]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
[Verse 3: John Lennon]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
[Chorus: John Lennon
with Paul McCartney & George Harrison
]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
[Outro: John Lennon
with Paul McCartney & George Harrison
]
Help me!
Help me, ooh
