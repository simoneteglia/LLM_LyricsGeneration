Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young
God save us, everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand, sins of our tongue
The sins of our father, the sins of our young
(Four, three, two, one)
