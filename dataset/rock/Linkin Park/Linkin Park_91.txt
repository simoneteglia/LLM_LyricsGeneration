[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Just do somethin' to tell you who I am, ya know?
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (Yeah) uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (High voltage, you can't shake the shock)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out)
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda,
with Chester Bennington,
]
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda,
Chester Bennington,
both
]
I've been diggin' into crates
ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race,
before monkeys had human traits (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed
lobotomies
with telekinetic
psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
And chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords to double-helixes
And
show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like
leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness on all of the MC's that hate us
So try on,
(Try it)
leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let
icons be bygones
I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit, with or without an accomplice
(Mixed Media) The stamp of approval is on this
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda,
with Chester Bennington,
]
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out

(Akira)
Put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
Blood type krylon, technicolor type A
On highways, bright with road rage
I'm
patient to win
the
cage and the tin
to bounce all around
In
surround sound,
devouring the scene
Subliminal
gangrene paintings,
overall, the same thing
Sing-song karaoke copy madness
Break bones verbally with
sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension
combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the tracks stands at attention ('Tention)
Meant to put you away with the pencil
pistol, official
Sixteen-
line, rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out of your flaws
Spittin'
raw blah blah blah,
you can say you saw
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda,
wi
th Chester Bennington,
]
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
High voltage
High voltage
High voltage
High voltage
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda,
with Chester Bennington,
]
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
It's high voltage, you can't
shake the shock
Because nobody wants it to stop,
check it out
