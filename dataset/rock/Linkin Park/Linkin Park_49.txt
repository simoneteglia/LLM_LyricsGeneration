[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes, I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need you to go
[Chorus: Chester Bennington,
Mike Shinoda
&
Both
]
(Don't stay)
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and
don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and
don't stay
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sometimes, I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes, I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes, I'm in disbelief, I didn't know
Somehow, I need to be alone
[Chorus: Chester Bennington,
Mike Shinoda
&
Both
]
(Don't stay)
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and
don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and
don't stay
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore
I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day
Of you wasting me away
(With no apologies)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington,
Mike Shinoda
&
Both
]
(Don't stay)
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
Just give me myself back and
don't stay
Forget our memories, forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and
don't stay
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Don't stay
Don't stay
