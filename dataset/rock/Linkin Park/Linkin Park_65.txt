[Intro: Jay-Z &
Mike Shinoda
]
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what (
Yeah
)
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga who
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga who
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what
You gon' need a vocalin right?
Yeah
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em up, numerous shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to po-po's, smoke 'em like coco
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit, Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the fool hit
Hey ma, how you know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight, get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, 'til you say, "Jay-Z, you're too much for me"
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Woo, woo, uh!
Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex
Imagine how I stroke, see how I was flowin' on my last cassette
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a TEC, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin' and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're actin' raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoes, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimpâ€”what a tragedy
She want us to end, 'cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said, "Shit, there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"
[Verse 4: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
And I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out, now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out, now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
