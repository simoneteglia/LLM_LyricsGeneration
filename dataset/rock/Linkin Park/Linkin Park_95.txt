[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is fun
"Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty"
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century, always timeless: Hov!
(That's a hustle)
Thank you for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with us, we appreciate that
Uh
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle, my nizzle,
used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me,
therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! Vamoose, son of a bitch
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda,
with Chester Bennington
]
Check it out, yo
It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away and
it's so unreal
I didn't look out below
I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on and didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried soâ€“
[Chorus: Jay-Z,
Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington

Oh, they havin' a good old time out there
It starts with

Oh, they havin' a good old time out there
It starts with

It starts with
