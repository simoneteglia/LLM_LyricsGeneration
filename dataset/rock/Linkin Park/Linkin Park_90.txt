[Intro: Motion Man]
Ayo, when this first started off it was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle, came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was KutMasta Kurt with a remix
(A remix, a remix, a remix, a remix)
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slippin' away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Tryna grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I've, I've, I've)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Verse 2: Motion Man]
Ayo, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up, you weaken your system
And had to throw it up
I brought you back into things
Like imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt leather, never pleather
Real bringin' the pleasure
By any means, it means I'm leavin' your team
Hell of a team, man, it seems but I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I've, I've, I've)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
'Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall
And hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run, with you mockin' me
Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now, chock full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(I've, I've, I've)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
In the end
