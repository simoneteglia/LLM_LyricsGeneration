[Verse 1]
Wake in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste, in my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place, there's no escape
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy
[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
[Verse 2]
I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared, I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Lookin' for help somehow, somewhere and no one cares
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm my own worst enemy
[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
[Bridge]
God!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my, put me out of my
Fucking misery!
[Chorus]
I've given up, I'm sick of feelin'
Is there nothin' you can say?
Take this all away, I'm suffocatin'
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
