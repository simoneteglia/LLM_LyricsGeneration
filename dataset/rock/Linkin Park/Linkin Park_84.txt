[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I'ma be that n-n-n-na-na-nail in your coffin
Sayin' that I softened?
I was duckin' down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience
Before you even say it, I know
You le-l-l-let your pride or you ego talk slick to me? No
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now, let me show you
Exactly how the breakin' point sounds
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna  see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
What is it you want me to tell you? I'm not the failure
I would rather live and let be
But you came with the right kind of threat to push me
To let you know you can't intimidate me
You di-di-disrespect me so clearly
Now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over
Now, let me show you
Exactly how the breakin' point sounds
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
I wanna  see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself! You did it to yourself!
You did it to yourself! You did it to yourself!
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I wanna see you choke on your lies!
Swallow up your greed!
Suffer all alone in your misery!
Choke on your lies! Swallow up your greed!
Suffer all alone in your misery!
