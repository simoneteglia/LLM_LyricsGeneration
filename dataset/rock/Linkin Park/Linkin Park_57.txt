[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
​​​(ti stnaw eno on ,siht ot neppah reven ll'ti ,ti stnaw eno oN)
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud
Every little thing that I think about
Just builds on top of the pain and doubt
Even though I wanna just let it out
I try to act like I don't mind it, try to keep my mouth so quiet
But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it
When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever
(siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
But every time I think I got everything put back together
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me
(siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
Now I don't know how it overflowed, spilled out unwillingly
(ti stnaw eno oN)
But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see
I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better
(ti stnaw eno oN)
'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever
(siht ot neppah reven ll'tI)
And every time you think you got everything put back together
(ti stnaw eno oN)
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose
[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]

[Bridge: Both,
Mike Shinoda
]
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly inside me
I can't run with this weight on my back
I can't see 'cause I'm focused on the past
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly
inside of me
[Outro: Chester Bennington,

Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly
inside of me
Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
I can't breathe, I need to break free
From the anger that is constantly
inside of me
