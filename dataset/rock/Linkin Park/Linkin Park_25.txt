[Verse 1]
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash as time began to blur
Like a startling sign, that fate had finally found me
[Pre-Chorus]
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
[Chorus]
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole, connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in between where we were standing
[Pre-Chorus]
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
[Chorus]
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Across this new divide
[Bridge]
In every loss, in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye was a mistake too great to hide
[Pre-Chorus]
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
[Chorus]
So give me reason to prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes
Give me reason to fill this hole, connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
[Outro]
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
