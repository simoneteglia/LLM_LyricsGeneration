[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah
Uh, so what'cha waitin' for, anticipatin' more
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fuckin' say they didn't say before
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
While you're waitin' for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like "one, two, three, four"
[Chorus: Page Hamilton &
Chester Bennington
]
And if I do what you demand
(
You say!
) You'll let me understand
(
You say!
) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(
You say!
) I'll have no debt to pay
(
You say!
) I'm gonna get what I deserve
Woah-oh-oh-oh
[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Page Hamilton]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing! All for nothing!
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya, I really don't know ya
You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you
I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda
with Chester Bennington
]
And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not takin' any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show you, have you checkin' your composure
While I make you step to it like "
one, two, three, four
"?
[Chorus: Page Hamilton &
Chester Bennington
]
And if I do what you demand
(
You say!
) You'll let me understand
(
You say!
) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(
You say!
) I'll have no debt to pay
(
You say!
) I'm gonna get what I deserve
Woah-oh-oh-oh
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus: Page Hamilton]
And if I do what you demand
You'll let me understand
[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Page Hamilton]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing! All for nothing!
All for nothing! All for nothing!
[Outro: Mike Shinoda &
Brad Delson
]
We're going too far
I don't think we're too far
We are
There's a difference, put the heavy shit there
The heavy shit right here?
