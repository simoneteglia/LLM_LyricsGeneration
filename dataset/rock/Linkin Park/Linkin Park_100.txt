[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Standing alone with no direction
How did I fall so far behind?
Why am I searching for perfection
Knowing it's something I won't find?
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When did I lose my sense of purpose?
Can I regain what's lost inside?
Why do I feel like I deserve this?
Why does my pain look like my pride? Oh-oh
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because I let myself down
In my fear and flaws
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run 'til the silence splits me open
I run 'til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one
No roads left but one
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I run and the silence splits me open
I run and it puts me underground
But there's no regret
And no roads left to run
