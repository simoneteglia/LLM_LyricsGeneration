[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean, everywhere
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breakin'
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground
Now I, now I do
[Guitar Solo: Brad Delson]

Mike Shinoda

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

The little things give you away
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
The little things give you away
(Oh)
All you've ever wanted

All you've ever wanted
