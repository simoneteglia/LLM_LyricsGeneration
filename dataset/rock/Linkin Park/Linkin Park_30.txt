[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I'll do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
(You live what you've learned)
You have to act like you're someone
(You live what you've learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you've learned)
You wanna share what you've been through
(You live what you've learned)
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
[Chorus: Chester Bennington and
Mike Shinoda

You wanna share what you've been through

You love to think you're never wrong (
Forfeit the game
