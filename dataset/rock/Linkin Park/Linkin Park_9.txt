[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So let mercy come and wash away
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So let mercy come and wash away
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
[Outro: Mike Shinoda &
Chester Bennington

(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
