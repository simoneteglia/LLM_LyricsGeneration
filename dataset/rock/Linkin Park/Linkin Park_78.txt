[Intro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you
And you think there's not enough love and no one to give it to
And you're sure you've hurt for so long, you've got nothing left to lose
So, you say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
You say the weight of the world has kept you from letting go
And you think compassion's a flaw, and you'll never let it show
And you're sure you've hurt in a way that no one will ever know
But someday, the weight of the world will give you the strength to go
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Whoa-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, da-yeah-nah, no-ooh-oh
No, no
[Chorus:
Chester Bennington
with Mike Shinoda]
Hold on, the weight of the world (
Na, no, no, no, no oh
)
(
Oh-ho, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Will give you the strength to go (
Yeah, yeah, aah
)
(
Yeah, no
)
So hold on, the weight of the world (
Yeah-aah, yeah, yeah
)
Will give you the strength to go (
Nah, ha, ha, ha, no-oh, no-oh
)
(
Ha ha ha ha, yah, yah, yah, no-oh, no-oh
)
(
No-oh
)
So hold on, the weight of the world (
Ah, yeah
)
Will give you the strength to go (
Mah, mah, mah
)
[Outro:
Chester Bennington
with Mike Shinoda]
(
Hold on, hold on, hold on
)
Just hold on, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
