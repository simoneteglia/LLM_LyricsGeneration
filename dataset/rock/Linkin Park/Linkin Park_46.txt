[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &
Mike Shinoda
]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(
Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
)
The sacrifice is never knowing
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &
Mike Shinoda
]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(
Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
)
The sacrifice is never knowing
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
[Bridge: Chester Bennington &
Mike Shinoda
]
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
)
The sacrifice is never knowing
[Chorus:
Chester Bennington
]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see, you're testing me, pushes me away
[Outro:
Chester Bennington
]
Pushes me away
