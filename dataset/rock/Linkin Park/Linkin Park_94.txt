[Intro]
(One, two
One, two, thank you)
[Verse 1]
There's no peace, only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease, only grow
You better be prepared to fight
[Pre-Chorus]
And it will not apologize
For layin' down your life
[Chorus]
War!
[Verse 2]
There's no pain it will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you're lost, in your despair
Forever black eternal night
[Pre-Chorus]
And it will not apologize
For layin' down your life
[Chorus]
War, destroyer
War, destroyer!
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
It needs no side to justify
Layin' down your life
[Chorus]
War, destroyer
War!
