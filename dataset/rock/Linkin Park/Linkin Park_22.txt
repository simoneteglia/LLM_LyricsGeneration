[Verse 1: Chester Bennington &
Mike Shinoda
]
Just a scar somewhere down inside of me
Something I can not repair
Even though it will always be
I pretend it isn't there (
This is how I feel
)
I'm trapped in yesterday (
Just a memory
)
Where the pain is all I know (
This is all I know
)
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &
Mike Shinoda
]
And I'll never break away (
Can't break free
)
'Cause when I'm alone
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington &
Mike Shinoda
]
But I'm tired, I will always be afraid
Of the damage I've received
Broken promises they made
And how blindly I believed (
This is all I know
)
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &
Mike Shinoda
]
I will never break away (
Can't break free
)
'Cause when I'm alone
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright (I'm lost)
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright (I'm lost)
I try to keep this pain inside
But I will never be alright
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
