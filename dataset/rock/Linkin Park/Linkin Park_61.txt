[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize
Your crusade's a disguise
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I'm aware of what you've done
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You will pay for what you've done
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced!!!
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites
Thieves and hypocrites!
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
No more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Your time has come to be replaced
Your time has come to be erased!
