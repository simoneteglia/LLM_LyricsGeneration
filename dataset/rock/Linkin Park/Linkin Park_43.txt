[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nothin' ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Never goes away
Never goes away
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Hearin' your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committin' myself to 'em and every day
I regret sayin' those things 'cause now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Never goes away
Never goes away
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

Never goes away
Never goes away
It never goes away
It never goes away (
Get away from me
)
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (
Go
)
Everything comes down to memories of (
You
)
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you (
Know
)
I've let you go, so
get away from me
Gimme my space back, you gotta just (
Go
)
Everything comes down to memories of (
You
)
I've kept it in, but now I'm
lettin' you (
Know
)
I've let you go
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And now you've become a part of me (You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me (You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you
