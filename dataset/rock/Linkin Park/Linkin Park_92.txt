[Intro: Stephen Richards &
Mike Shinoda
]
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Nwod kaerb yllautneve nworf reven ohw elpoep eht neve
Trapa sllaf gnihtyreve
Dniwnu lla ti hctaw ot tfel emit fo tuo er’ew dnif noos ll’uoy
Dne ot sah gnihtyreve
Nwod kaerb yllautneve nworf reven ohw elpoep eht neve
Trapa sllaf gnihtyreve
Dniwnu lla ti hctaw ot tfel emit fo tuo er’ew dnif noos ll’uoy
Dne ot sah gnihtyreve
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you (To you, to you, to you, to you)
This is the last smile
That I’ll fake for the sake of being with you
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda &
Chester Bennington
]
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
(
For the sake of being with you
)
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice is never knowing
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
En ohw elpoep eht neve
Neve trapa sllaf gnihtyreve
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda &
Chester Bennington
]
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
(
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
)
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
[Bridge: Stephen Richards,
Stephen Richards & Chester Bennington
]
Reverse psychology's failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There's nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking,
"Why?"
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington,
Chester Bennington & Stephen Richards
]
The sacrifice of hiding in a
lie
The sacrifice is never knowing
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
