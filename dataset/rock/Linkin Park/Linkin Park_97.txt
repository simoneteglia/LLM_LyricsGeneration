[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yo
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed Media slang bangin' in your boombox
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rappin' to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killin' me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are gettin' help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rappin' over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
But now, they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You wanna be an MC? You've gotta study the skill
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda,
Chester Bennington
]
So, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally, you don't have the hip-hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories
(Bullshit)
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40
(Top 40)
And your record company is completely missin' it
All the kids are dissin' it for not bein' legitimate
So in a battle, you can't hack it, react with wack shit
And get smacked with verbal backflips
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MC's to establish this
You're new to hip-hop, and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic, leave that to the experienced
[Break: Mike Shinoda]
Using the waves of sound
The true master paralyzes his opponents
Leaving him vulnerable to attack
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up! Step up!
[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
After years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists
We here at the Sound Institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system
Actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
And the question must be asked…
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!
[Outro: Joe Hahn]
