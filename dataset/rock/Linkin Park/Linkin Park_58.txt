[Verse 1]
My insides all turned to ash, so slow
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold
[Pre-Chorus]
A black wind took them away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night
[Chorus]
And the clouds above move closer
Lookin' so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
[Verse 2]
I used to be my own protection, but not now
'Cause my path has lost direction, somehow
[Pre-Chorus]
A black wind took you away from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night
[Chorus]
And the clouds above move closer
Lookin' so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
[Bridge]
So now you're gone, and I was wrong
I never knew what it was like to be alone
[Outro]
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's day, on a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
