[Intro: Beyoncé]
And said drink from me, drink from me
(I, oh, I, oh, I)
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feeling drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
Poured on a symphony
Drink from me, drink from me
(I, oh, I, oh, I)
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feelin' drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
That we shoot across the sky
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin,
Chris Martin & Beyoncé
]
I said,
drink from me, drink from me
When I was
so
thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put
your wings on me, wings on me
When I was
so
heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
[Chorus: Chris Martin &
Beyoncé
]
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high (Woo)
(
Ooh, ooh, ooh
)
[Verse 2: Chris Martin,
Chris Martin & Beyoncé
,
Beyoncé
]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars (
Stars
) come out
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin,
Chris Martin & Beyoncé
]
Put
your wings on me, wings on me
When I was
so
heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
[Bridge: Beyoncé,
Beyoncé & Chris Martin
]
I, oh, I, oh, I
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, so high, so high
I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
[Outro: Beyoncé  & Chris Martin,
Beyoncé
]
That me shoot across the sky
That me shoot across the
Let me shoot across the sky
That me shoot across the (
Let me shoot
)
Let me shoot across the sky
That me shoot across the
Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
