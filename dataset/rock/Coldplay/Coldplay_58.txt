[Ambience]
[Verse]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds
[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams
[Bridge]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I've just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams
