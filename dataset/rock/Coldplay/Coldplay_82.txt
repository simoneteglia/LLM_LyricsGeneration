[Verse]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just livin' in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am livin' there as well, oh
[Chorus]
Time is so short, and I'm sure
There must be somethin' more
[Verse]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just livin' in my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am livin' there as well, oh
[Chorus]
Time is so short, and I'm sure
There must be somethin' more
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven, but you oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Outro]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just livin' in my head
Ooh
