[Verse 1]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?
[Pre-Chorus]
But on and on
From the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waitin' in line
Just to see if you care
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
And I wanted to say
[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waitin' for you
[Verse 2]
So you know how much I need ya
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance
Of gettin' you?
[Pre-Chorus]
But on and on
From the moment I wake
To the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side
Just you try and stop me
I'll be waitin' in line
Just to see if you care, if you care
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
And I wanted to say
[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waitin' for you
[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll always be waitin' for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you, I will always be waiting
[Bridge]
And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you
[Outro]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need ya
But you never even see me
