Lovers In Japan
[Verse 1]
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong
[Chorus]
They are turnin' my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keepin' my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're gonna get out
[Verse 2]
Tonight, maybe we're gonna run
Dreamin' of the Osaka sun
Oh, oh
Dreamin' of when the mornin' comes
[Chorus]
They are turnin' my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keepin' my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun'll come out
Reign of Love
[Intro]
One, two, three
[Verse 1]
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind, lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a
reign of love
[Bridge]
Locust wind, here I stop
How I wish I'd spoken up to a reign of love
[Verse 2]
Reign of love
By the church we're waitin'
Reign of love
On my knees go prayin'
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a
reign of love
