[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
My father said, "Never give up, son"
Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad
,
Mahatma
, and
Nelson
Not scared to be strong
[Spoken]
“What if they say I’m no good?
What if they say, "Get out of here, kid
You got no future?”
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they’re right
No, I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, "No, wait, they're wrong"
And get to keep on dancin' all life long
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
My father said, "Never give up, son"
Just look what
Amelia
and
Joan
done
Oh
Rosa
,
Teresa
their war won
Not scared to be strong
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they’re right
No, I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, "No wait, they’re wrong"
And get to keep on dancin' all life long
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah, you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains, and lightnin' in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize
You'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient
, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trustin' statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k
But I’m tryin' to turn K’s to M’s
What does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show, or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself
But honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent 'til we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races
Success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah, you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
I see heaven inside
You'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains
You can break through those chains
You'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on
[Outro: Chris Martin]
In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on
And you can't go wrong
