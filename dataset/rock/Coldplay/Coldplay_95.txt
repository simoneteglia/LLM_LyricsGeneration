[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
So you lost your trust
And you never should have
And you never should have
But don't break your back if you ever see this
But don't answer that
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
In a bulletproof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doin' my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
So they came for you
They came snappin' at your heels
They come snappin' at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever say this
But don't answer that
[Chorus: Chris Martin &
Chris Martin & Will Champion
]
In a bulletproof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doin' my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon
[Outro: Chris Martin]
I know, you lost your trust
I know, you lost your trust
I know, don't lose your trust
I know, you lost your trust
