[Intro]
[Indecipherable]
[Verse 1]
"Turn your magic on," Umi, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
We are legends, every day"
That's what she told me
"Turn your magic on," to me, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds"
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
Oh, you make me feel
[Chorus]
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
[Verse 2]
Said, "I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me"
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can I feel my heart beatin'
'Cause you make me feel
[Chorus]
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
[Verse 3]
"Turn your magic on," Umi, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds takin' shape
We are diamonds takin' shape"
[Bridge]
(Woo, woo-hoo)
(Woo, woo-hoo)
If we've only got this life, this adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life, you'll get me through alive
And if we've only got this life, in this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you, with you, with you
Oh, see, yeah, see, yeah, I
[Outro]
Do-hoo (Woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)

Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)

Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)
