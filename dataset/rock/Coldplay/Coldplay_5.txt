[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
[Chorus: Chris Martin
with Will Champion
]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
[Chorus: Chris Martin
with Will Champion
]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try
to fix you
[Interlude]
[Bridge: Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman & Will Champion]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose somethin' you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I...
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
