[Intro: Jacob Collier]
Cry, cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, cry
[Verse: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
In a book about the world
Called
The Luminous Things
There are trees and flowers glowing
While Jizo Bodhisattva sings
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
[Bridge: Chris Martin &
Jacob Collier
]
(
Dum-dum-dum
) Don't want us to hurt each other (
Dum-dum-dum
)
Or cause each other pain (
Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum
)
(
Dum-dum-dum
) Don't want to fear what we don't know (
Dum-dum-dum
)
(
Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum
)
(
Dum-dum-dum
) We're in this together, baby (
Dum-dum-dum
)
We're as singing is to rain (
Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum
)
So I'll never, ever, ever let you go (
Dum-dum-dum
)
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
[Outro: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
For your miracles outnumber
All the stars out in the sky
