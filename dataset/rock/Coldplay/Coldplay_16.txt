[Verse 1]
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you wanna say?
[Pre-Chorus]
I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say
[Chorus]
You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
I'm okay
[Verse 2]
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look, Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I wanna say
[Chorus]
Is you're so far away
Oh, and you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
It's okay
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) You're so far away
[Outro]
Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please stay, oh, please stay
Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day, just one day
