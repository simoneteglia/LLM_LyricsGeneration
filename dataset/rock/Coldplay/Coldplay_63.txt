[Verse 1]
Trying hard to speak and fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction, it's all part of the plan
When something is broken and you try to fix it
Trying to repair it any way you can
[Verse 2]
I dive in at the deep end, you become my best friend
I wanna love you, but I don't know if I can
I know something is broken, and I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it any way I can
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
[Instrumental Outro]
