[Verse 1]
Can anybody fly this thing
Before my head explodes or my head starts to ring?
[Pre-Chorus]
We've been livin' life inside a bubble
We've been livin' life inside a bubble
[Chorus]
Confidence in you is confidence in me
Is confidence in a high speed
[Verse 2]
Can anybody stop this thing
Before my head explodes or my head starts to ring?
[Pre-Chorus]
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been livin' life inside a bubble
[Chorus]
Confidence in you is confidence in me
Is confidence in a high speed
[Post-Chorus]
In high speed
High speed
[Outro]
In high speed you on
In high speed you on
In high speed you on
High speed
