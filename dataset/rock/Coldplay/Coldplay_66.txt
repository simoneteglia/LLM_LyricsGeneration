Verse
1]
We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Movin' in the dead of night
We took photographs, just some, just so
History has some to know
We were movin' at the speed of flight
[Pre-Chorus]
(Kids cry)
If you want to
, that's alright
If you want to hold me
Hold me tight
[Chorus]
Just an alien
[Verse 2]
We were hoverin' without a home
Millions are UFO
Hoverin' in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says
[Pre-Chorus]
"Fly if you want to, that's alright
But if you want to call me
Call this line"
[Chorus]
Just an alien, just an alien
Oh, we just wanna get home again
[Spoken Interlude]
Tell your leader, sir or ma'am
We come in peace, we mean no harm
Somewhere out there in the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phonin' home
[Outro]
Watching my life on the skyline
Crossing your eyes for a lifetime
Just an alien
Moving target, target movement
Oh, we just wanna get home again
A patch, a corner of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it, turning pages
Over Asia, crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just wanna get home again
