[콜드플레이, 방탄소년단 "My Universe" 가사]
[Intro: Chris Martin,
All

You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (
I
) just want (
Just want
) to put you first
And you (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe, and I
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook,
All
,
Jung Kook & Chris Martin
]
매일 밤 네게 날아가 (
가
)
꿈이란 것도 잊은 채
나 웃으며 너를 만나 (
나
)
Never-ending forever, baby
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
All
]
You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (

And you (

), you are (
You are
) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

어둠이 내겐 더 편했었지
길어진 그림자 속에서 (
Eyes
)
And they said that we can't be togethеr
Because
,
becausе we come from different sides
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
All
]
You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (
I
) just want (
Just want
) to put you first
And you (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And you make my world light up inside
[Post-Chorus: All,
Jin
]
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
(You make my world)
You make my world light up inside
Make my world light up inside
[Bridge: j-hope,
SUGA
]
나를 밝혀주는 건
너란 사랑으로 수 놓아진 별
내 우주의 넌
또 다른 세상을 만들어 주는 걸
너는 내 별이자 나의 우주니까
지금 이 시련도 결국엔 잠시니까
너는 언제까지나 지금처럼 밝게만 빛나줘
우리는 너를 따라 이 긴 밤을 수놓을 거야
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook,
Jung Kook & Jimin
,
Chris Martin & Jung Kook
]
너와 함께 날아가
When I'm without you, I'm crazy
자
어서 내 손을 잡아
We are made of each other, baby
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
All
]
You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (
I
) just want (
Just want
) to put you first (
To put you first
)
And you (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And you make my world light up inside
[Post-Chorus: All]
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
You, you are (You are)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
I just want (Just want)
My universe
You, you are (You are) my universe, and I
My universe
[Outro: All]
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
