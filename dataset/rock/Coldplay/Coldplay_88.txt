[Intro]
Ah-hmm
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims going nowhere in millions of cars
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"
[Bridge]
Yeah
Ah-hmm
Ah-hmm
[Chorus:
Chris Martin and Tiwa Savage
, Chris Martin]
In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"
[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride
