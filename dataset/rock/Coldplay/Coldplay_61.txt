[Verse 1]
We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"
[Chorus]
And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and its weight"
And here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day
[Verse 2]
We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place where you can be who you are
[Chorus]
And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh
[Bridge]
And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
"Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?"
Oh thanks God, mustâ€™ve heard when I prayed
Cause now I always want to feel this way
[Outro]
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today
