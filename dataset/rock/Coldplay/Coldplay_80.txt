[Verse 1]
And the hardest part was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start
[Chorus 1]
I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out
[Verse 2]
And the hardest part was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing, but I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh
[Chorus 2]
I can feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're a silver lining the clouds
Oh, and I
Oh and I, I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about
[Outro]
Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh, and that's the hardest part, that's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part, that's the hardest part
