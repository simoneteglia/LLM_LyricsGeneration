[Verse 1]
A flock of birds
Hoverin' above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love
[Chorus]
And I always
Look up to the sky, pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive, sometimes they are gone
They fly on
[Verse 2]
A flock of birds
Hoverin' above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Followin' 'em up
[Chorus]
Still I always
Look up to the sky, pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive, next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
[Outro]
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on
