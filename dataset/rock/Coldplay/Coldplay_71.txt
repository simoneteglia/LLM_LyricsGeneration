[Verse 1]
Been standing in the corner
Studying the lights
The dreaming of escapin'
Will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up
Got me in the rays
So I guess I better stay
"Uh-uh, no, come on," you say
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a fool's gold thunder, it's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start "What if I won't see you again?"
Around here, you never wanna sleep all night
Just start falling in love, start the riot and
[Chorus]
Come on, rage with me
We don't need words
And we'll be birds
Got to make our own key
[Verse 2]
Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing
But geography
[Pre-Chorus]
Come on and raise it, come on, raise this noise
For the million people who got not one voice
Come on, it's not over, if you mean it, say loud
Come on all for love, out from the underground
[Chorus]
Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds
Flying free
Holding on in the mystery
[Bridge]
Fearless, fearless through this
You said, "We'll go, oh, oh, oh
Through this together" Oh, oh, oh, yeah
[Outro]
When you fly, won't you
Won't you take me, too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool
