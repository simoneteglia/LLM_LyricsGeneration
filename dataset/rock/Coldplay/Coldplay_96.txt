[Intro]
(So I race for it)
[Verse 1]
Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart, boom, b-boom, boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Comin' home and I'm finding no peace
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm unlocked
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know what you've got
[Chorus]
So I put my hands up to the sky, I feel alive
You've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, that's alright
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)
[Verse 2]
Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, b-boom, boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been innocent, but a sinner in me
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in love
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm lost
[Chorus]
I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
Got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocket; eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky
I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it (yeah, yeah)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
[Outro]
(So I race for it)
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know what I've got
(So I race for it)
"X" marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky, I feel like
I've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like (yeah, yeah)
I got a rocket; eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky; I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure (yeah, yeah)
Wherever you are
