[Verse 1]
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops, I remember there was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows, they were watchin' while we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show,
you'd better lie low
[Chorus]
If you love me, won't you let me know?
[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
and a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles, and a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground, my nerves are poles that unfroze
[Chorus]
And if you love me, won't you let me know?
[Interlude]
Oh-oh
[Bridge]
I don't wanna be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow far below
[Chorus]
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?
[Outro]
I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow, all that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?
