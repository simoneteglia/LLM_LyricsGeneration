[Verse 1]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
I've gotta say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face
[Verse 2]
Where do we go to draw the line?
I've gotta say I wasted all your time, oh, honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face, yeah
[Chorus]
And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
[Verse 3]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face, ah yeah
[Chorus]
And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine
[Bridge]
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
Na, na-na, na-na, num-ma-na, na-na
As good as mine
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)
[Outro]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
