[Intro]
People on the left
People on the right
You got a lion inside
People are the pride
Let's go
[Verse 1]
There's a man who swears he's God
Unbelievers will be shot
There's a man who walks around
Like he owns the fuckin' lot
There's a man who takes his time
From his homemade cuckoo clock
And he makes us march around it
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
[Verse 2]
There's a crocodile cross-eyed
There's a turning of the tide
We're no longer gonna fight for
Some old crook and all his crimes
There's a sewing up of rags
Into revolution flags
Got to stand up to be counted
Be an anthem for your times
[Bridge]
It's just work
It's just work, it's not easy
And we could all be blown apart
And Heaven is a fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark
It's just work, believe me
Still, my beating heart
We'll all be free to fall in love
With who we want and say
[Outro]
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah) (Ooh)
Yeah (Yeah)
People of the pride (Go)
