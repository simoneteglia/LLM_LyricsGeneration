[Intro: 'Otuto Nke Chukwu']
Gi nwa nke chukwu, gini ka ina ekwu
N'ihi ihe nile
Nke chukwu mere
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"
[Interlude]
Oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh oh
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best at taking flight
But my rocket ship reversed
Oh, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
Chris & Will
]
(
When I sail
) And when I sail
I'm sailing west
(
Know I might fail
) Knowing I might fail
But still I'm hoping for the best
(
In my dreams
) And in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say
"I wandered the whole wide world bu
t
Baby, you're the best"
[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Lo lo-lo-lo lo oh
Ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yeah
Lo lo-lo-lo lo
[Outro: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world
