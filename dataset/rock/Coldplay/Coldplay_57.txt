[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits
For a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh, ooh
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
From the top of the world, the top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, ah
Now we're stoppin' the world, stoppin' its spin
But, come on, don't give up, don't say we give in
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
[Post-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh, didn't we have fun?
[Verse 2: Chris Martin,
Chris Martin & Tove Lo
]
I know it's over before she says
"Know someone else has taken your place"
"I know it's over", Icarus says
To the sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight till it's over, fight till it's done
Oh
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Tove Lo,
Chris Martin
]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh, ooh
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
From the top of the world, the top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, ah
Now we're stoppin' the world, stoppin' in its tracks
Nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over, before you run
Oh, didn't we have fun?
[Bridge: Chris Martin & Tove Lo,
Chris Martin
]
'Cause you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be
We were always meant to, always meant to,
you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be
[Breakdown: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh, didn't we have fun?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh, didn't we have fun?
[Outro: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
But then
Maybe we could again
