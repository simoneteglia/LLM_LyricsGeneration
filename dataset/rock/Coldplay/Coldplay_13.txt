[Verse 1]
Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you
[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
Oooh ooh ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious jewel
[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
[Bridge]
Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it ma-, ma-ma-magic
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 3]
And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Oh yes, I do
[Outro]
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course, I do
