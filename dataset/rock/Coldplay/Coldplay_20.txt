[Verse 1]
Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said
[Verse 2]
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done
[Chorus]
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm
[Verse 3]
Oh no, I see
A spider web, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble
[Chorus]
Singin' that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm
[Outro]
They spun a web for me
And they spun a web for me
And they spun a web for me
