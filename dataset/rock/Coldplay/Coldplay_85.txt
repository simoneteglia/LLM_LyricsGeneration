[Intro: Angel Moon]
All I know is I love you so
[Verse 1: Angel Moon]
I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Change for your pocket, someone for the night
I hope they name you a rocket, take you for a ride for free
And if they tell you you're nothing, maybe you'd explain
To me, you're the summer sun after the rain
And you were there when I needed something for the pain, you see
[Chorus: Angel Moon]
When you love me, love me, lovе me
When you love mе, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I'm nowhere else, I'm on top of the world, man
On top of the world and it's so beautiful
[Post-Chorus: Angel Moon]
And you're so beautiful
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I hope that you get everything you want in this beautiful life
Watermelon moon, so happy you're alive
And I feel like a river, finally arrived at sea
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Angel Moon,
Angel Moon
]
'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be on top of the world, man
On top of the world
and it's so beautiful
[Post-Chorus: Angel Moon]
And you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
Chris Martin & Angel Moon
,
Angel Moon
]
'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
I know I'll be on top of the world, man
On top of the world
and it's so beautiful
[Post-Chorus: Angel Moon,
Chris Martin & Angel Moon
]
And
you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful
And
you're so beautiful
And it's so beautiful
