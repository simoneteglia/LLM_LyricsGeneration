[Verse 1]
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?
[Verse 2]
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it?
[Bridge]
Sing it please, please, please
Come back, come sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me
Come back and sing
[Outro]
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh, yeah
