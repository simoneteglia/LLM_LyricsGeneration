[Intro: Apple Martin]
Three, two, one
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I just can't take it
Sometimes, I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Oh)
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record and I'm not playing right
Drocer nekorb a ekil m'I
Till you tell me on the heavenly phone
[Pre-Chorus]
To hold tight (Hold tight)
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on, yeah)
Don't let go, oh, oh, oh
Hold tight (Hold tight)
Hold tight (Hold tight)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
"It's alright, it's alright," you said
I got my hands up shaking just to let you know
[Chorus]
That you've got a higher power
Got me singin' every sеcond, dancin' every hour
Oh, yeah, you'vе got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know (Oh)
[Verse 2]
This boy is electric
This boy is electric
and you're sparklin' light
The universe connected
And I'm buzzin' night after night after night (Oh)
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you
[Chorus]
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singin' every second, dancin' every hour
Oh, yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know (I wanna know, oh)
[Bridge]
You got, yeah, you got a high
You got, yeah, you got a higher
You got, yeah, you got a high
You got, oh, oh, oh, oh
You got, oh, you got a high
You got, yeah, you got a higher
You've got, oh, you've got a high
Got my hands up shaking just to let you know now
[Chorus]
You've got a higher power
You got me singin' every second, dancin' any hour
Oh, yeah, you've got a higher power
You're once in any lifetime, I'm goin' a million miles an hour
When, for so long, I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long, I'd been down on my knees
Till your love song floats me on
, ee-oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
