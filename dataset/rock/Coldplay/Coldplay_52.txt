[Verse 1: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
Boys, boys don't cry
Boys keep it all inside
I tried to hide it underneath
Still, my heart starts to beat
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jacob Collier]
My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart
Oh, my human heart
Night and day and light and dark
Any day, it could be torn in half, ooh
Only got a human heart
[Verse 2: Paris Strother & Amber Strother]
Girls can make believe
Girls wear it on the sleeve
Thought I could pretend for trying's sake
Still, my heart had to break
[Chorus: All]
My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart
Oh, my human heart
Night and day and light and dark
Any day, it could be torn in half, ooh
Only got a human heart
