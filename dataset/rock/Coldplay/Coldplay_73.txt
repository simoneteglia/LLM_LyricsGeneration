[Verse 1]
I wanna live life and never be cruel
And I wanna live life and be good to you
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna fly and never come down
And live my life and have friends around
[Chorus]
We never change, do we? No, no
We never learn, do we?
[Post-Chorus]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
[Verse 2]
I wanna live life and always be true
And I wanna live life and be good to you
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna fly and never come down
And to live my life and have friends around
[Chorus]
We never change, do we? No, no
We never learn, do we?
[Post-Chorus]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where makin' more friends would be easy
[Bridge]
Oh, and I don't have a soul to save
Yes, and I sin every single day
[Chorus]
We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?
[Outro]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out
