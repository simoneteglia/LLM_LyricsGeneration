[Verse 1]
Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums
The judgment of this court is we need more guns
[Refrain]
Stop
[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too
[Verse 2]
Melt down all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or
A Thousand Splendid Suns
?
Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones
It's the opinion of this board that we need more guns
[Refrain]
Stop
[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too
