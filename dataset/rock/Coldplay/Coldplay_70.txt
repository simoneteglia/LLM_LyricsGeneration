[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high
[Outro: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
