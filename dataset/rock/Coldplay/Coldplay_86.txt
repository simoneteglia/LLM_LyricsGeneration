[Verse]
Tony was a friend of mine
We were together all the time
He had my back
Once he really saved my life
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna call him
Say, "Hey, let's stay up 'til morning"
[Chorus]
And when I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens
Sweetens and mends
Old friends
[Outro]
We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends
Hmm, hmm
And there are no ends to old friends
Amen
