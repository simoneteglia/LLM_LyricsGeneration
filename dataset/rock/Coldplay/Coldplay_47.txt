[Verse 1]
In the darkness 'fore the dawn
In the swirlin' of the storm
When I'm rollin' with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on
[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirlin' swimmin' on
When I'm rollin' with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
[Refrain]
(Ooh-ah)
(Ooh-oh)
(Ooh-oh)
(Ooh-ah)
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Outro]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
