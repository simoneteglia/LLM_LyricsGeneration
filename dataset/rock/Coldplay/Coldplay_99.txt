[Intro]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
[Verse 1]
Today, I heard the strangest
I heard the strangest song
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A DJ a star away is
Playing it to turn us on
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hey)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
My heart started glowing
I feel it inside, it's flowing
[Chorus]
I say, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still, they call us humankind
[Verse 2]
Today, I had the strangest
Feeling that I belonged
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Before, I was dying
I feel it inside, now, I'm flying
[Chorus]
I said, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designеd, yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from anothеr planet
Still, they call us humankind
[Post-Chorus]
Woo
Alright
[Bridge]
Before, I was dying
I feel it inside, now, I'm flying
[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed
Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But we're capable of kindness
So they call us humankind
