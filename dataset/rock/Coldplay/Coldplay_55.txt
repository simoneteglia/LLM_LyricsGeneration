[Verse 1]
Oh brother, I can't
I can't get through
I've been tryin' hard to reach you
'Cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future
And I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you
[Chorus]
You could take a picture of somethin' you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do somethin' that's never been done
[Verse 2]
Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missin' piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well, I feel like they're talkin' in a language
I don't speak
And they're talkin' it to me
[Chorus]
So, you take a picture of somethin' you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do somethin' that's never been done
Do somethin' that's never been done
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
So, you don't know where you're goin'
And you wanna talk
And you feel like you're goin'
Where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen
But you feel ignored
And nothin's really makin' any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk (U-uh)
