[Verse 1]
Coloratura
We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us
Is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out
Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself
And love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd
[Chorus]
And up there in the heavеns
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Hеlix
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll get there
So for now
[Post-Chorus]
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you
[Verse 2]
In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out
[Chorus]
And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto
Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon
So will you
[Post-Chorus]
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
And up there in the heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us, too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
All the satellites imbue
The purple, yellow
Green, red, orange and the blue
Oh, it's a crazy world, it's true, yeah
Sing it out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Post-Chorus]
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want—
In this crazy world, it's true
I just want you
[Outro]
Poets prophesy up in the blue
Together, that's how we'll make it through
