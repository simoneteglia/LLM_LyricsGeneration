[Verse 1]
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
[Chorus]
Up above, candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on to all those
Chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
[Bridge]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea
And city meet
May all your troubles
Soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights
Keep shining on
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring
Her back to me
Then all my troubles
Will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights
Keep shining on
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outor]
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks
In me
May all your troubles
Soon be gone
Those Christmas lights
Keep shining on
