[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
There's a wild wind blowin' down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowin'
There's a cold war comin', on the radio I heard
Baby, it's a violent world
[Chorus]
Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow?
I can hear it comin', I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground
[Verse 2]
Time came creepin', oh, and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on, time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night
[Chorus]
Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow?
I can hear it comin' like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground
[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh
[Outro]
Gravity, release me, and don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground
