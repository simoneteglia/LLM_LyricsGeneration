[Part 1: O (Fly On)]
[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1]
A flock of birds, hovering above
Just a flock of birds, that's how you think of love
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on
[Verse 2]
A flock of birds, hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned, and rise
, following 'em up
Still, I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next, you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on, on
[Outro]
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on
[Part 2: O]
[Instrumental]
[Verse]
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
