[Verse 1]
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
[Chorus]
I say, oh
I say, oh
[Verse 2]
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold onto
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah I will, yeah I will, yes I will
[Chorus]
I said, oh
I cry, oh
[Bridge]
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
[Outro]
Sing it out
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
La-la-la-la, oh-oh
