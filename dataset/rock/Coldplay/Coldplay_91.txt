[Part I: Everything's Not Lost]
[Verse 1]
When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
But with the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away
[Chorus]
So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be countin' up my demons, yeah
Hopin' everything's not lost
[Verse 2]
When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
And everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down
[Chorus]
'Cause if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be countin' up my demons, yeah
Hopin' everything's not lost
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be countin' up my demons, yeah
Hopin' everything's not lost
[Outro]
And singin' out, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Everything's not lost
So come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
A-come on, yeah
And everything's not lost
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
And everything's not lost
Come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
A-come on, yeah
A-come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
A-come on, yeah
And everything's not lost
Sing out, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
A-come on, yeah
And everything's not lost
Come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Sing out, yeah
And everything's not lost
[Part II: Life Is for Living]
[Verse]
Now I never meant to do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong, then I'm sorry
But don't let it stand in our way
'Cause my head just aches when I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for livin', we all know
And I don't wanna live it alone
[Chorus]
Sing, ah, ah, oh
Sing, ah, ah, oh
And just sing, ah, ah, oh
