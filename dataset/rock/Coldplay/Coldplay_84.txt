[Verse 1]
You cut me down a tree and brought it back to me
And that's what made me see where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf and kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself, you can only blame me
[Chorus 1]
And I could write a song a hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong, and you belong with me
And I could write it down or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found, or swallowed in the sea
[Verse 2]
You put me on a line and hung me out to dry
And darling, that's when I decided to go see
You cut me down to size and opened up my eyes
Made me realize what I could not see
[Chorus 2]
And I could write a book, the one they'll say that shook
The world and then it took, it took it back from me
And I could write it down or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found, and you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea
[Interlude]
(Ooh, ah)
(Ooh, ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus 3]
And I could write a song a hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong, and you belong with me
The streets you're walking on, a thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong, and you belong with me
[Chorus 4]
Oh, what good is it to live with nothing left to give?
Forget, but not forgive,
not loving all you see
All the streets you're walking on, a thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong, and you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
[Outro]
You belong with me, not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me,
not swallowed in the sea
