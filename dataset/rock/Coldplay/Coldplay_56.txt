[Verse 1]
Look at Earth from outer space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik
[Chorus]
And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
[Verse 2]
Give me one, 'cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust
Don't forget the rest of us
Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Wounds that heal and cracks that fix
Tell me your own politik
[Chorus]
And open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes
[Bridge]
But give me love over, love over
Love over this, ah-ah-ah
And give me love over, love over
Love over this, ah-ah-ah-ah
[Instrumental Outro]
