[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
[Chorus]
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild, we'll be glowing in the dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh
We'll be glowing in the dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh
[Bridge]
All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows as the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot, we'll be glowing in the dark
[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah
[Outro]
So we'll soar luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark
