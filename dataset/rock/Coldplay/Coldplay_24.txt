[Intro: Chris Martin]
(Let somebody, let somebody go)
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
We had a kind of love I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh, my other, oh, my friend
We talked around in circles and we talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
You gave everything, this golden glow
Now, turn off all the stars 'cause this, I know
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
That it hurts like so
To let somebody go
[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
All the storms we weathered, everything that we went through
Now, without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and I asked them to explain
They said, "Love is only equal to the pain"
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Selena Gomez]
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Selena Gomez]
Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go
[Post-Chorus: Chris Martin,
Selena Gomez
]
Oh-oh, oh (
Oh
)
Oh-oh, oh (
Let somebody, let somebody go
, yeah)
[Bridge: Chris Martin & Selena Gomez]
Oh, oh-oh, (Oh) when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
Got to let somebody know (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh, (Oh) when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
Got to let somebody know (Oh)
(Oh) when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
Christ Martin & Selena Gomez
]
Then it hurts like so
To let somebody go
It hurts like so
To let somebody go
[Outro: Chris Martin]
But you're still with me now I know
(Let somebody, let somebody go)
Oh-oh, oh (Let somebody, let somebody go)
But you're still with me now, I know
