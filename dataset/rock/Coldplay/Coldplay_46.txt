[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight
[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking in to
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag
[Outro]
Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
