Bones, sinkin' like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

All that we fought for
And homes, places we've grown
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world

There's nothin' here to run from
'Cause yeah, everybody here's
Got somebody to lean on
