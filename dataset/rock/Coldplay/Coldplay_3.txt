[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry, you don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you, and tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions, no, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails, heads on a science apart
[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
[Verse 2]
I was just guessin' at numbers and figures, pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me,
come back and haunt me
,
oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails, comin' back as we are
[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy, oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy, no one ever said it would be so hard
I'm goin' back to the start
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro]
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
