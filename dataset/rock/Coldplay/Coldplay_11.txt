[Verse 1]
The lights go out, and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singin'
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waitin' to be tamed, singin'
[Chorus]
You are
You are
[Verse 2]
Confusion never stops
Closin' walls and tickin' clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singin'
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'
[Chorus]
You are
You are
You are
You are
[Chorus]
You are
You are
[
Bridge
]
And nothin' else compares
Oh, nothin' else compares
And nothin' else compares
[Chorus]
You are
You are
[Outro]
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home
(You are)
home, where I wanted to go
Home
(You are)
home, where I wanted to go
