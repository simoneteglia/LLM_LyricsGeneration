[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I could be you, you could be me
Two raindrops in the same sea
You could be me, I could be you
Two angles of the same view
And we share the same blood
[Interlude]
[Verse 2: Stromae,
Will Champion & Chris Martin
]
Comme deux gouttes d’eau
On se ressemble
Comme provenant de la même mère
Comme deux ruisseaux (
You could be me
)
Qui se rassemblent
(I could be you
)
Pour faire les grandes rivières
And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood
[Saxophone Solo]
[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood
[Sample: Femi Kuti]
Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon, music is the weapon of the future
[Outro: Chris Martin]
Same fucking blood
Same fucking blood
