[Intro: Chris Martin,
All
]
You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (
I
) just want (
Just want
) to put you first
And you (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe, and I
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook,
All
,
Jung Kook & Chris Martin
]
I fly to you every night (
Fly
)
Forgetting that it's just a dream
I meet you with a smile (
Meet
)
Never ending forever, baby
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
All
]
You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (
I
) just want (
Just want
) to put you first
And you (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And you make my world light up inside
[Verse 2: V,
RM
,
RM & Chris Martin
,
RM & Jimin
]
I was more at ease in the dark
In the shadows that grew long (
Eyes
)
And they said that we can't be together
Because
,
because we come from different sides
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
All
]
You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (
I
) just want (
Just want
) to put you first
And you (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And you make my world light up inside
[Post-Chorus: All,
Jin
]
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
(You make my world)
You make my world light up inside
Make my world light up inside
[Bridge: j-hope,
SUGA
]
What light me up are
Stars adorned with love made of you
In my universe, you
Make another world for me
Because you are my stars and my universe
These hardships are just temporary
Just shine as bright as you shine now
We will follow you to adorn this long night
[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook,
Jung Kook & Jimin
,
Chris Martin & Jung Kook
]
I fly away with you
When I'm without you, I'm crazy
Please
hold my hand
We are made of each other, baby
[Chorus: Chris Martin,
All
]
You (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And I (
I
) just want (
Just want
) to put you first (
To put you first
)
And you (
You
), you are (
You are
) my universe
And you make my world light up inside
[Post-Chorus: All]
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
You, you are (You are)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
I just want (Just want)
My universe
You, you are (You are) my universe, and I
My universe
