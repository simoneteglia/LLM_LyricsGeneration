[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Fixing up a car, driving it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
[Bridge: Chris Martin]
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it’s mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift
[Guitar Solo 1: Jonny Buckland]
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up
[Guitar Solo 2: Noel Gallagher]
[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa, oh
[Outro: Chris Martin]
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up
Don't ever give up
[Coda: Annabelle Wallis]
