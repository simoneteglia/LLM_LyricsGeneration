[Verse 1]
My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone
[Verse 2]
Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own
[Chorus]
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
Can I get that message home?
[Verse 3]
My song is love
My song is love unknown
But I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own
[Chorus]
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home
[Bridge]
And I'm not gonna stand and wait
I'm not gonna leave it until it's much too late, oh
On a platform, I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home
[Outro]
My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home
