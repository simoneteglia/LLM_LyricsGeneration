[Intro: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Drunk, so high, so high
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (High)
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (So high)
(High, high, high)
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
Drink from me, drink from me
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (High)
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (So high)
(High, high, high)
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
La, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
[Outro: Chris Martin & Beyoncé]
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot across the)
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...
