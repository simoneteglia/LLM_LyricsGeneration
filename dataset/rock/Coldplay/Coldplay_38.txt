[Intro]
One, two, three
[Verse]
Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos givin' orders
Everythin' is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
I wonder where they'll go (Ah)
Trouble's on the outside, I know
[Chorus]
But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo,
then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two
[Piano Solo]
[Bridge]
(Go!)
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Everything is fallin' all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only
Thing left that's true
