[Verse 1]
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here, where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know?
Show me the right way to go"
[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
But you're feelin' so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies
[Verse 2]
I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives, look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear, no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh, I forget everything I learn
[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
And you're feelin' so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies
[Bridge]
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
Ah, and if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
[Outro]
And the spies came out of the water
But you're feelin' so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
