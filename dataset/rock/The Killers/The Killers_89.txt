[Verse 1]
I'll tell you what you wanna know
But boy, you better listen close
People gonna tell you lies
Don't let it come as a surprise
[Chorus]
That woman's on my back again
I know she's got the best intentions
When you begin to realize
You know you got your daddy's eyes
[Verse 2]
And there's something I wanna say
I love her, too
And all of this has got nothing to do with you
[Verse 3]
And I'd like to stay but I can't because
I've been fooling around
and I know
That you called 'cause you never even knew
That it was hurting me
[Verse 4]
When you put it on the other hand
When you're old enough to understand
That glove will bring it all to life
I didn't say that made it right
[Chorus]
'Cause that woman's on my back again
I know she's got the best intentions
When you begin to realize
You know you got your daddy's eyes
That woman's on my back again
I know she's got the best intentions
When you begin to realize
You know you got your daddy's eyes
[Break]
And sometimes people get tired
And I woke up a little too late to lie
Dreams should last a long time
This is not what I'd call goodbye
[Chorus]
That woman's on my back again
I know she's got the best intentions
When you begin to realize
You know you got your daddy's eyes
That woman's on my back again
I know she's got the best intentions
When you begin to realize
You know you got your daddy's eyes
[Outro]
I love her, too
