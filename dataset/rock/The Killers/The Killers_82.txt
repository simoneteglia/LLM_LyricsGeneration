[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
[Verse 1]
To the center of the city, where all roads meet
Waiting for you
To the depths of the ocean, where all hopes sank
Searching for you
Well, I was moving through the silence without motion
Waiting for you
In a room without a window in the corner
I found truth
[Verse 2]
In the shadow play, acting out your own death
Knowing no more
As the assassins all grouped in four lines
Dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies
Made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief
As the crowds all left
Woo!
[Bridge]
I did everything, everything I wanted to
I let them use you for their own ends
To the center of the city in the night, waiting for you
To the center of the city in the night, waiting for you
Woo!
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
