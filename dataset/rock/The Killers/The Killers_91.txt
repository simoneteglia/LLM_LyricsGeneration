[Verse 1]
The streets of persuasion
Are plated with gold
Your heart's in the right place
But you traveled down the wrong road
Like so many before you, the gates open wide
Here come the rising tide
[Chorus]
Let's go out tonight
There's a mystery underneath the neon light
Before life and the dream collide
Because the truth's gonna come and cut me open wide
And you can't escape the rising of the tide
[Verse 2]
Keep up your appearance
You're joining the choir
With everybody singing out glory Hallelujah
The time came for your solo
But there was nowhere to hide
Here come the rising tide
[Chorus]
And the company you keep
Where they plan your crucifixion as we speak
So baby, till life and the dream collide
There's going to be a mystery underneath those neon lights
If you can't decipher just who's on your side
You will not escape the rising of the tide
[Verse 4]
Can you tell me brother
Was I deceived or in denial?
I was there in the back of the room when you testified
With your pitchfork tongue you licked your lips and lied
We're never going to know how hard you cried
When you petitioned and your access was denied
Till the venom in your veins is satisfied
Till you suffocate and swallow down the pride
Where you can't escape, yeah you can't escape
No you can't escape the rising of the tide
