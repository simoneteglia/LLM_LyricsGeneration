[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers]
Time it tells, living in my home town
Wedding bells, they begin easy
Live it down, baby don't talk that much
Baby knows, but baby don't tease me
In the park, we could go walking
Drown in the dark, or we could go sailing
On the sea
[Verse 2: Lou Reed,
Brandon Flowers & Lou Reed
]
Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love, or was it just easy?
Money talks when people need shoes and socks
Steady, boys, I'm thinking she needs me
I was just sipping on something sweet
I don't need political process
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers,
Brandon Flowers & Lou Reed
]
I got this feeling that they're going to break down the door
I got this feeling they they're going to come back for more
See, I was thinking that I lost my mind
But it's been getting to me all this time
And it don't stop dragging me down
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Lou Reed]
Silently, reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently, correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes I'm a travel man
But tonight, this engine's failing
[Bridge: Mo Manye, Tamara Robinson & Journi Gallwey &
Brandon Flowers
]
I still hear the children playing
Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack
Steal a car and ring a round-rosey
Rock and roll, candy land, boogeyman
Run away and give me your sneakers
[Verse 3: Brandon Flowers & Lou Reed,
Brandon Flowers
]
Acid rain,
when Abel looked up at Cain
We began the weeping and wailing
A hurried high from pestilence, pills and pride
It's a shame, we could've gone sailing
But heaven knows, heaven knows everything
Tranquilize
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Lou Reed]
I got this feeling that they're going to break down the door
I got this feeling they they're going to come back for more
See, I was thinking that I lost my mind
But it's been getting to me all this time
And it don't stop dragging me down
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Lou Reed]
Silently, reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently, correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes I'm a travel man
But tonight, this engine's failing
[Post-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
And I still hear the children playing
Dead beat dancers come to us and stay
[Outro: Lou Reed]
'Cause I don't care where you've been
And I don't care what you've seen
We're the ones who still believe
And we're looking for a page
In that lifeless book of hope
Where a dream might help you cope
Where the Bushes and the bombs
Are tranquilized
