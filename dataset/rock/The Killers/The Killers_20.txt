[Verse 1]
You got the will of a wild
A wild bird
You got the faith of a child
Before the world gets in
[Chorus]
You got some kind of love
You got some kind of love
(Some kind)
[Verse 2]
You got the soul of a truck
On a long distance haul
You got the grace of a storm
In the desert
[Chorus]
You got some kind of love (some kind of love)
You got some kind of love
You got some kind
You got some kind
You got some kind
You got some kind of love
You got some kind
You got some kind
You got some kind
You got some kind of love
You got some kind
You got some kind
You got some kind
You got some kind of love

Can't do this alone
We need you at home
There's so much to see
We know that you're strong
Can't do this alone
We need you at home
There's so much to see
We know that you're strong
Can't do this alone
