[Verse 1]
Lookin' out the window, out on the street
I don't know what happened, I'm out on my feet
I hear my mother calling my name
I still come running, but I ain't the same
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can change the channel
Take the phone off the hook
Avoid the headlines
But you'll never grow up, baby, if you don't look
[Chorus]
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears
[Verse 2]
You're used to winning, how did it feel?
Could you hear the screaming? It was unreal
What did they pay you, what did it cost?
How long did it take you to know that you lost?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
You can hit the showers
Fill the place up with steam
Close the curtains
But when you woke up, man it wasn't no dream
[Chorus]
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes, close my eyes
Just to stop the tears
[Bridge]
Lookin' out the window out on the street
My boy and his mother
And I think of me
Feelin' the slip again
Don't wanna fall
You said it was nothing, but maybe you're wrong
[Chorus]
'Cause when I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to hold my breath 'til the coast was clear
When I saw him go down
Felt like somebody lied
I had to close my eyes just to stop the tears
(Just to stop the tears)
(Just to stop the tears)
