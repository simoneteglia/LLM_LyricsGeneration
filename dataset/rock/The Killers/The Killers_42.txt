[Intro]
We met dragging Main at Spanish Fork
And he wasn't moving away from here, so it wasn't really—
And we could build a house here
But—
[Verse 1]
Hope'll set your eyes agleam
Like
four feet
dangling in the
stream
But the Kingdom of God, it's a pressure machine
Every step, gotta keep it clean
A mattress on a hardwood floor
Who could ever ask for more?
I'll get up and cut the grass
Ain't nothing wrong with working class
[Chorus]
I, I don't remember the last time you asked how I was
Don't you feel the time slipping away?
It ain't funny at all
It's gonna break your heart one day
[Verse 2]
Keep the debt cloud off the kids
Only sunshine on their lids
Jiminy Cricket and Power Wheels
And memories of Happy Meals
Sometimes, I look at the stars
And think about how small we are
Sweating it out in the pressure machine
Good 'til the last drop
[Chorus]
Why don't you say little things?
Butterflies don't just dance on a string
It feels like you clipped all their wings
And every year goes by faster than the one before
[Verse 3]
We've had that treadmill now for months
I think she might've used it once
If I shut my mouth and keep the peace
She'll cook my eggs in
bacon grease
Life'll grow you a big red rose
Then rip it from beneath your nose
Run it through the pressure machine
And spit you out a
name tag memory
[Instrumental Outro]
