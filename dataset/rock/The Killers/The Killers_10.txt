[Verse 1]
Save some face, you know you've only got one
Change your ways while you're young
Boy, one day you'll be a man
Oh, girl, he'll help you understand
[Chorus]
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
[Verse 2]
Looking back at sunsets on the East side
We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things slide by so carelessly
[Chorus]
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
[Bridge]
And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did
[Chorus]
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
[Outro]
Oh no, oh no, no, no
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no
