[Verse 1]
Candy talks to strangers
Thinks her life's in danger
No one gives a damn about her hair
It's lonely down on Track Street
She used to go by Jackie
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers
Take a number where the blood just barely dried
[Chorus]
Wait for something better
No one behind you
Watching your shadows
This feeling won't go
[Verse 2]
Crooked wheels keep turning
Children, are you learning
Acclimatized, but don't you lose the plot
A history of blisters
Your brothers and your sisters
Somewhere in the pages we forgot
[Pre-Chorus]
Take a number Jackie
Where the blood just barely dried
You know I'm on your side
[Chorus]
Wait for something better
No one behind you
Watching your shadows
You got to be stronger than the story
Don't let it blind you
Rivers are shallow
This feeling won't go
[Bridge]
Your sky is full of dreams
But you don't know how to fly
I don't have a simple answer
But I know that I could answer
Something better
[Outro]
This feeling won't go
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
