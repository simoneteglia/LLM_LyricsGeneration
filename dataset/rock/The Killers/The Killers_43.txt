[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers]
Mirage after mirage
Crawling back to your arms
Stay, stay
From your mouth to my heart
Stay, stay
From your mouth to my heart
Stay, stay
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Weyes Blood]
Don't talk to me about forgiveness
My God, just look who's back in business
That weight that dragged you down,
it has been made light
And I'm at the top of my lungs
'Cause big love cannot be understated
Don't push, control is overrated
I know that if we stick together
My God
,
it's like the weight has been lifted
[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers]
Wipe the dust from my eye
Wash my feet with your tears
My God, my God
From your mouth to my heart
Stay, stay
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Weyes Blood]
Don't talk to me about forgiveness
My God, just look who's back in business
That weight that dragged you down, it has been made light
And I'm at the top of my lungs
'Cause big lovе cannot be understated
Don't push, control is ovеrrated
I know that if we stick together
My God, it's like the weight has been lifted
[Bridge: Weyes Blood]
The weight has been lifted
We finally let go
We let go of what holds
Our hearts in the cold
The weight has been lifted
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Weyes Blood]
Don't talk to me about forgiveness
My God, just look who's back in business
That weight we lugged around, it has been made light
I'm at the top of my lungs
'Cause big love cannot be understated
Don't push, control is overrated
I know that if we stick together
My God
, it's like the weight has been lifted
My God, it's like the weight has been lifted
My God, it's like the weight has been lifted
