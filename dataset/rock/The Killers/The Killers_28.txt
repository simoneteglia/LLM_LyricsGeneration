[Verse 1]
Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain little girl by the drain
Motherless child
, rescue rescue
Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain with your doll by the drain
Motherless child, rescue rescue
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Keep an ear to the shell, keep an ear to the shell
Stay on the path that leads to the well
There are many take the one that leads to the well, rescue rescue
Keep an ear to the shell, keep an ear to the shell
[Chorus 1]
Motherless child dost thou believe
That thine afflictions have caused us to grieve?
Motherless child angels have closed
Their eyes, thou wast thrown away and exposed
[Verse 2]
Don't you listen to the never
Keep praying for rain
Dancing for rain, no sweet for the pain of a motherless child
Rescue rescue
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Keep an ear to the shell, keep an ear to the shell
Stay on the path that leads to the well
There are many, take the one that leads to the well
[Chorus 2]
Motherless child, follow my voice
And I shall give thee great cause to rejoice
Motherless child, be of good cheer
Mine arm is reached out, I am here
I'll crush every doubt and every fear
Clothesline the shame and you will answer to the name
[Bridge]
Wonderful wonderful, wonderful wonderful
Motherless child I am with thee, thou wast never alone
Maybe I'm dirty, maybe I'm unworthy
Motherless child, can you hear me? I will give you a home
Wonderful wonderful, wonderful wonderful
Motherless child I am with thee, thou wast never alone
Maybe I'm dirty, maybe I'm unworthy
Motherless child, can you hear me? I will give you a home
You were never alone
