Intro: Brandon Flowers
]
Hey kid
I'm getting tired
Of all this
Running around
I think I'm going down
Oh yeah
Don't you think it's time
Time we reconciled
Maybe we could
Talk a while
Santa had a change of heart
Santa had a change of heart
Santa had a change of heart
Santa had a change of heart
A change of heart
A change of heart
[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers]
And we know it wasn't easy
You've been after me a long while
A pathological display
Now take a moment to imagine
My dismay
When I heard you had a heart change
I was skeptical at first
Til' you've seen it for yourself
I guess you just expect the worst
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
Iron will for telling lies
Cheap sick smile and
one inch fuse
You hurt me Santa and I'm confused
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I hear you on the bomb shell
I was taken back myself
And I'd like to make it alright
So I called the elves
We hashed up a little guess what
Your nice status was renewed
Just tell Santa what you want
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Red Porsche 944 like Jake
In "Sixteen Candles" for goodness sake
And a couple more you might have missed
Like a shiny Rolex on my wrist and
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?
[Bridge: Brandon Flowers]
Too many people in black robes posing as judges
They should turn that mirror around
Too many people weighed down by frivolous grudges
When will we look to leave the past behind?
[Bridge: Richard Dreyfuss]
You know it's nice to see you wrapped up
See how far you've come
There's something to be said for being present
Not just getting one
So pass the gravy and tap your toes
And don't mind Ol' Jack Frost nipping at your nose
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
A crooked nose and bloodshot eyes
Iron will for telling lies
If you've got squabble in your skin
Just take that turkey and trade it in for
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
[Outro: Brandon Flowers]
All I ever really wanted was
Pretty girls, Christmas lights
Mistletoe, holy nights
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?
Don't it sound like heaven on a cloud?
