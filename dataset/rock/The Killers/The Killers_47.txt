[Verse 1]
Leaves are fallin' down on the beautiful ground
I heard a story from the man in red
He said, "The leaves are fallin' down,
such a beautiful sound
Son, I think you'd better go ahead"
But you always hold your head up high
'Cause it's a long, long, long way down
This town was meant for passing through
Boy, it ain't nothin' new
Now go and show 'em that the world stayed round
But it's a long, long, long way down
[Pre-Chorus]
You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go
[Chorus]
Or should I just get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
Well, this river is wild
This river is wild
[Pre-Chorus]
Run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
(I shake a little) Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk
(I shake a little) Sometimes I hate the line I walk
I just wanna to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go
[Chorus]
Or should I just get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
Because this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild
[Verse 2]
Now Adam's taking bombs and he's stuck on his mom
Because that bitch keeps trying to make him pray
He's with the hippie in the park, combing over the dark
Just trying to get some of that little-girl play
[Pre-Chorus]
You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world, don't watch it turn
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go
[Chorus]
Or should I get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
The pain is hell in me tonight
Because this river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild
This river is wild, godspeed ya, boy
This river is wild
[Outro]
Now the cars are everywhere, raisin' dust at the fairground
I don't think I ever seen so many headlights
But there's something pulling me
The circus and the crew, well, they're just passing through
Making sure the merry still goes 'round
But it's a long, long, long way down
