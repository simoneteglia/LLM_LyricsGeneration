[Intro]
Come with me
[Verse 1]
We took a back road
We're gonna look at the stars
We took a backroad in my car
Down to the ocean
It’s only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands
[Verse 2]
But I don't really like you, apologetically dressed in the best, put on a heartbeat glide
Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold wet dirt I cry
And on the cold wet dirt I cry
[Chorus]
Don’t you wanna come with me? Don’t you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural
[Verse 3]
A cinematic vision ensued
Like the holiest dream
There's someone calling
An angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same:
"Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine."
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them when the dead of night
Comes calling
to save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right
[Chorus]
Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural
Don’t you wanna swim with me? Don’t you wanna feel my skin
On your skin?
It's only natural
[Bridge]
(Never had a lover)
I never had a lover
(Never had soul)
I never had soul
(Never had a good time)
And I never had a good time
(Never got cold)
I never got gold
[Chorus]
Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna swim with me? Don't you wanna feel my skin
On your skin?
It's only natural
Don't you wanna come with me? Don't you wanna feel my bones
On your bones?
It’s only natural
Come and take a swim with me.
Don't you wanna feel my skin
On your skin?
It’s only natural
