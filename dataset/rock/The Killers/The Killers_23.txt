[Verse 1]
I know what you want
I'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
If you can keep a secret
I got a blanket in the back seat on my mind
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak, but no one heard her cry
[Chorus 1]
"Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh"
[Verse 2]
I know there's a hope
There's too many people tryin' to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah, yeah
We were just in time
Let me take a little more off your mind
There's somethin' in my head, somewhere in the back, sayin'
"We were just a good thing, we were such a good thing"
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Make it go away without a word
But promise me you'll stay and fix these things I've heard
[Chorus 2]
Oh, make it go away, oh
Drive faster, boy, ooh, yeah-ooh
Oh no
[Pre-Chorus 3]
A crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl
With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls
I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier
Of stars in atmosphere
and watched her disappear
[Chorus 3]
Into the midnight show
A-faster, a-faster, a-faster, a-faster, faster, a-faster
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
[Outro]
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret, I can keep a secret
(She said she loved me)
If you can keep a secret
Well, baby, I can keep it if you can keep a secret
