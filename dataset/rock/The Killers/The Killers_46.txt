[Intro]
When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
It's not so bad, it's not so bad
How do you know that you're right?
[Verse 1]
I awoke on the roadside
In the land of the free ride
And I can't pull it any longer
The sun is beating down my neck
So I ran with the devil
Left a trail of excuses
Like a stone on the water
The elements decide my fate
Watch it go
[Chorus 1]
When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
Don't tell me that it's over, stand up
Poor and tired, but more than this
How do you know that you're right?
If you're not nervous anymore
It's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 2]
I feel my vision slipping in and out of focus
But I'm pushing on for that horizon
I'm pushing on
Now I've got that blowing wind against my face
So you sling rocks at the riptide
Am I wrong or am I right?
I hit the bottom with a "huh!", quite strange
I get my glory in the desert rain
Watch it go
(When I offer you survival)
[Chorus 2]
When I offer you survival
You say it's hard enough to live
And I'll tell you when it's over, shut up
Poor and tired, but more than this
How do you know that you're right?
If you're not nervous anymore
It's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Bridge]
Higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
Higher and higher, higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out of the fire
Higher and higher, higher and higher
We're gonna take it down to the wire
We're gonna make it out, whoa-oh-oh
Higher and higher
[Outro]
It ain't hard to hold
When it shines like gold
You'll remember me
