[Intro]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
I believe in you and me
[Verse]
I'm comin' to find you, if it takes me all night
Wrong until you make it right
And I won't forget you
At least I'll try and run
And run tonight
[Chorus]
Everything will be alright, everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright, everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
[Post-Chorus]
Alright, alright
Alright
Alright
Alright
[Interlude]
La la la la la la
A-ho
[Bridge]
I wasn't shopping for a doll
To say the least, I thought I'd seen them all
But then you took me by surprise
I'm dreamin' 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
So take your suitcase, 'cause I don't mind
And baby doll, I meant it every time
You don't need to compromise
I'm dreamin' 'bout those dreamy eyes
I never knew, I never knew
But it's alright
Alright
[Chorus]
Everything will be alright, everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright, everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright, everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright, everything will be alright
Everything will be alright
It will be alright
