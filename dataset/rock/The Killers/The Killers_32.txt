[Verse 1]
We're building up a kingdom
We pray it never falls
I can lose my temper
You can put up walls
And I hate when it gets serious
It's like we're going blind
Take the needle off the record
I can't stand another chorus
About Juliet's control
Over mystified mankind
[Chorus]
But I can't get you out of mind
To get you out of my bed
To get you out of my heart
And my head
(Oh, we're falling)
(Oh, we're falling)
[Verse 2]
I stormed the gates of Graceland
To make you realize
Went back to back with Springsteen
You turned and rolled your eyes
So I told you about McCartney
And that's a heavy name to drop
You say you don't need confirmation
But I don't know if I can stop
[Chorus]
Cause I can't get you out of my mind
To get you out of my bed
To get you out of my heart
And my head
(Oh, we're falling)
(Oh, we're falling)
[Outro]
Oh we're falling
Oh we're falling
Oh we're falling
Oh we're falling
Oh we're falling
