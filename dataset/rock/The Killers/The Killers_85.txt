[Verse 1]
Help me out, I need it
I don't feel like loving you no more
I don't feel like loving you no more
[Verse 2]
Help me out, I need it
I don't feel like touching her no more
Help me out, I need it
I said, I don't feel like touching her no more
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, how did it happen?
I spent two long years in a strange, strange land
Well, how did it happen?
I'd do anything just to be your man
[Chorus]
You're not going anywhere without me
These trials don't prepare the air, and no
You're not telling anyone about me
And you shake and you bleed while I sing my song
[Post-Chrorus]
I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like loving you
I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like loving you
[Verse 3]
All the different places
Ringing out like a shotgun in my head
All the pretty faces
Ringing out and I just can't go to bed
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how did it happen?
I spent two long years in a strange, strange land
Oh, how did it happen?
I'd do anything just to be your man
I'd do anything just to be your man
[Chorus]
You're not going anywhere without me
These trials don't prepare the air, and no
You're not telling anyone about me
And you shake and you bleed while I sing my song
[Bridge]
I don't feel like touching you
I don't feel like touching you
I don't feel like touching you
I don't feel like touching you
You can't tell anyone about me
[Chorus]
You're not going anywhere without me
Help me out, I need it (Help me out, I need it)
You can't tell anyone about me (Help me out, I need it)
Help me out, I need it
[Post-Chorus]
I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like loving you
I don't feel like, I don't feel like
I don't feel like loving you
