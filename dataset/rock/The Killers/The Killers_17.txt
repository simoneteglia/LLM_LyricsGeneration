[Intro]
And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick
[Verse 1]
I
walked into town with a message for my old man
I've got the last two chapters of Matthew in my hand
Steve painting houses while Bobby went and gone insane
They buried my sister but daddy he stayed the same
[Chorus]
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light
[Verse 2]
His hands still shake when the ponies break out on the track
(Here comes the calling)
His feet still quick when they say they want their money back
(Here comes the calling)
But Daddy did you think that you could outrun the Holy Ghost? (Here comes the calling)
Lie, cheat, steal, hope they
fix it all up in post
[Pre-Chorus]
The book will be open
In front of the judge
Unquenchable fire
Or keys to the kingdom
[Chorus]
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright
Brother, just lean into the light
[Bridge]
You heard that the master was traveling through
But what would you do if he walked in the room?
Make for the left, or break for the right?
Brother, just lean in
Brother, just lean into the light
[Chorus]
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
You wanna be sure, I’ll give you sight
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
The road to the kingdom's burnin' bright
Brother, just lean into the light
(Just lean into the light)
Follow the sun out of the night
Brother, just lean into the light
[Outro]
Here comes the calling
Here comes the calling
