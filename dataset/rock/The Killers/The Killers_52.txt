[Verse 1]
The parking lot is rammed with shotgun pickup trucks
At the
Jones Rubber plant
where all the guys end up
Beer-drinking boy scouts
living life like they ain't stuck
On these quicksand streets
with their girls in a sling
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing
[Verse 2]
Around here, we all take up our cross and hang on His holy name
But the cards that I was dealt will get you thrown out of the game
Hey, mama, can't you see your boy is wrapped up in the strangle silk
Of this cobweb town where culture is king?
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing
[Chorus]
I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young
[Verse 3]
Down at Old Mill Park, half the town's in tow
To crown the bathing beauty of the rodeo
While her mother fights back proud tears, a young cowboy gives the nod
The chute opens, bull draws blood, and the gift is accepted by God
The chute opens, bull draws blood, and the gift is accepted by God
In this barbed wire town of barbed wire dreams
I'm in my bedroom on the verge of a terrible thing
[Chorus]
I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young
I close my eyes and think of the water
Out at the Salt Creek when I was young
