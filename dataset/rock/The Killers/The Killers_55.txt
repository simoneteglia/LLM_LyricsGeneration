[Verse 1]
Shaking like the devil when she lets me go
Got a new place, and how it's so much better
Falling over myself, the television's on
I turn it off and smile
Oh, Jennifer, you know I always tried
Before you say goodbye
[Chorus]
Leave the bourbon on the shelf
And I'll drink it by myself
And I love you endlessly
Darling, don't you see?
I'm not satisfied until I hold you tight
[Post-Chorus]
Give me one more chance tonight
And I swear I'll make it right
But you ain't got time for this
And that wrecking bell is ringing
And I'm not satisfied
Until I hold you
[Verse 2]
Jennifer, tell me where I stand
And who's that boy holding your hand?
Oh, Jennifer, you know I'll always try
Before you say goodbye
[Chorus]
Leave the bourbon on the shelf
And I'll drink it by myself
And I never liked your hair
Or those people that you lie with
And I'm not satisfied until I hold you tight
And I love you endlessly
Darling, don't you see?
I can't be satisfied until I hold you tight
[Outro]
Leave the bourbon on the shelf
And I'll drink it by myself
And I'll love you endlessly
Darling, don't you see?
I'm not satisfied
