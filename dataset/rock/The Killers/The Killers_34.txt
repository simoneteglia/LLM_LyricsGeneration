[Verse 1]
There's gonna be opposition
Ain't no way around it
But if you're looking for strong and steady
Well, baby, you found it
We'll weather the coldest night
Baby, we're a dying breed
When everyone's compromising
I'll be your diehard
I'll be there when water's rising
I'll be your lifeguard
We're cut from a stained glass mountain
Baby, we're a dying breed
[Refrain]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 2]
When facing the wind got wicked
We rallied and raised up
So now if she comes back kicking
We'll know what we're made of
There's gonna be opposition
But we've got everything we need
Ooh, baby, we're a dying breed
[Chorus]
From the coveted touch of a girl in love
I was lifted by the sound of a spirit in need
Baby, we're a dying breed
[Bridge]
I don't know what you want from me
Sometimes I don't know what to do
It's like I'm screaming in a dream
It's like I can't get through
What if we're not prepared for this?
What if we just can't find the trail?
Then I remember the promise I made
And the way that I fell
[Chorus]
For the coveted touch of a girl in love
I was taken by the sound of a spirit in need
Baby, we're a dying breed
We've got everything we need
Baby, we're a dying breed
[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
