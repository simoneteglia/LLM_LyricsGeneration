[Intro]
One, two
[Verse 1]
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
On the match with the boys, you think you're alone
With the pain that you drain from love
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world
[Chorus]
'Cause Andy, you're a star
Get down, hey
[Verse 2]
Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
Hey, shut up, hey, shut up, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
On the streets, such a sweet face jumped in town
In the staffroom, the verdict is in
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world
[Chorus]
'Cause Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes but mine
Andy, you're a star
In nobody's eyes, in nobody's eyes but mine
