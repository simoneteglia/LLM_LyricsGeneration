[Verse 1]
Have all the songs been written?
Have all the truths been told?
Has all the gas been siphoned?
Do the banks still carry gold?
[Chorus]
Has every ship gone sailing?
Has every heart gone blue?
Have all the songs been written?
Oh, I just need one to get through to you
I just need one more
[Verse 2]
Have all the songs been written?
Have all your needs been met?
Have all these years been worth it
Or am I the great regret?
[Chorus]
Has every ship gone sailing?
Has every heart gone blue?
Have all the songs been written?
Oh, I just need one to get through to you
I just need one more to get through to you
I can't take back what I've done wrong
I just need one more
[Bridge]
When the train returns to the rails
When the ship is back in the harbor
I will make you happy again
I can see it, I believe it
[Chorus]
I just need one more to get through to you
I just need one more to get through to you
I can't take back what I've done wrong
I just need one more
