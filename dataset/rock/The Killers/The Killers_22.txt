[Verse 1]
Be still
Go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead
Life is short to say the least
We're in the belly of the beast
Be still, wild and young
Long may your innocence reign
Like shells on a shore
May your limits be unknown
May your efforts be your own
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore
[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done
[Verse 2]
Be still
One day you'll lead
Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see
Was there something out there for me
Be still
Close your eyes
Soon enough, you'll be on your own, steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood
Over rock, over chain, over trap, over plane
When they knock you down
[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Be still, be still
Be still, be still
[Bridge]
Over rock and chain
Over sunset plane
Over trap and snare
When you're in too deep
In your wildest dreams
In your made up schemes
When they knock you down
When they knock you down
[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got so much heart
Is this real or just a dream, oh
Rise up like the sun
And labor till the work is done
Rise up like the sun
And labor till the work is done
Rise up like the sun
And labor till the work is done
