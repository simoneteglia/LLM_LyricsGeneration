[Verse 1]
Nobody ever had a dream 'round here
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me
Nobody ever pulls the seams 'round here
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me
[Verse 2]
I've got this energy beneath my feet
Like something underground's gonna come up and carry me
I've got this sentimental heart that beats
But I don't really mind that it's starting to get to me now
[Chorus 1]
Why do you waste my time?
Is the answer to the question on your mind
And I'm sick of all my judges
So scared of what they'll find
But I know that I can make it
As long as somebody takes me home
Every now and then
[Break]
Well, have you ever seen the lights?
Have you ever seen the lights?
[Verse 3]
I took a shuttle on a shockwave ride
Where people on the pen pull the trigger for accolades
I took a bullet and I looked inside it
Running through my veins, an American masquerade
[Verse 4]
I still remember grandma Dixie's wake
I've never really known anybody to die before
Red, white and blue upon a birthday cake
My brother, he was born on the fourth of July and that's all
[Chorus 2]
So why do you waste my time?
Is the answer to the question on your mind
And I'm sick of all my judges
They're so scared of letting me shine
But I know that I can make it
As long as somebody takes me home
Every now and then
Every now and then
[Outro]
You know I see London, I see Sam's Town
Holds my hand and let's my hair down
Rolls that world right off my shoulder
I see London, I see Sam's Town
now
