[Intro]
And there is nothing
I wouldn't do
There is nothing
I wouldn't give
There is nothing
Compelling me
[Verse 1]
Let me introduce you to the featherweight queen
She got Hollywood eyes
But you can't shoot what she's seen
Her mama was a dancer
And that's all that she knew
'Cause when you live in the desert
It's what pretty girls do
[Chorus]
I'm throwin' caution
What's it gonna be?
Tonight the winds of change are blowin' wild and free
If I don't get out
Out of this town
I just might be the one who finally burns it down
[Post-Chorus]
I'm throwin' caution
I'm throwin' caution
[Verse 2]
Never had a diamond on the sole of her shoes
Just black top, white trash
Straight out of the news
Doesn't like birthdays
They remind her of why
She can go straight from zero
To the Fourth of July
[Chorus]
I'm throwin' caution
What's it gonna be?
Tonight the winds of change are comin' over me
If I don't get out
Out of this town
I just might be the one who finally burns it down
[Post-Chorus]
I'm throwin' caution
I'm throwin' caution (Throwin' caution)
I'm throwin' caution
I'm throwin' caution (Throwin' caution)
[Bridge]
'Cause it's some kind of sin
To live your whole life
On a might've been
I'm ready now
[Instrumental Outro]
