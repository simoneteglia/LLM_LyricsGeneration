[Intro]
I tried going against my own soul's warning
But in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving even though the sky was storming
I just wanted to get back to where you are
[Verse]
If you could see through the banner of the sun
Into eternity's eyes, like a vision reaching down to you
Would you turn away?
What if it knew you by your name?
What kind of words would cut through the clutter of the whirlwind of these days?
[Pre-Chorus]
I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried diving, even though the sky was storming
Thunderheads were forming
[Chorus]
But then I thought I could fly
And when I hit the ground
It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights
Like a goddamn knife
And it got me thinking, no matter how far
I just wanted to get back to where you are
[Pre-Chorus]
I tried going against my own soul's warning
And in the end, something just didn't feel right
Oh, I tried running from the memory and the mourning
But the penalty kept on pouring
[Chorus]
And now I think I know why
'Cause when I hit the ground
It made a messed up sound
And it kept on rattling through my days
And cutting up my nights
Like a goddamn knife
And it got me thinking, no matter how far
I just wanted to get back to where you are
