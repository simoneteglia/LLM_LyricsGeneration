[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers]
Last night I saw you dressed in white
Nothing around you
You were standing in the lightning field of love
You were waiting for the lightning to come
I didn't want to wake up
I just wanted to run my fastest
And stand beside you
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
I just wanted to run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field of love
I didn't want to wake up
I just wanted to run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field
Press your face to mine, name and raise again
Take the car out for a drive
Run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field of love
Name and raise again, press your face to mine
Run my fastest and name and raise again
Hold your hand again, speak your name again
Over heels again, tell you everything
[Bridge: K.D. Lang,
Brandon Flowers
]
Late at night, I lie in bed and think about things left unsaid and
All the things that I'd do different if I just had the chance
Don't beat yourself up, you laid good ground
Look at 'em all from scratch 'til sundown
You put the work in and then some
Where is all this coming from?
There's no end to love
There's no end to truth
There's no end to me
There's no end to you
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
I just wanted to run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field of love
Press your face to mine,
name and raise again
Take the car out for a drive
Take me with you to the other side
Run my fastest and stand beside you in
The lightning field of love
Name and raise again, press your face to mine
Run my fastest and name and raise again
Give my name again, speak your name again
Bring myself to just tell you everything, tell you everything
Everything
