[Verse 1]
Remember Rio and get down
Like some other DJ, in some other town
She's been tryin' to tell me to hold tight
But I've been waitin' this whole night
[Pre-Chorus]
But I've been down across a road or two
But now I've found
The velvet sun that shines on me and you
[Chorus]
In the back, ah-ho, I can't crack
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho, I can't fake
We're on top, we're on top
[Verse 2]
The day is breakin', we're still here
Your body's shakin' and it's clear
You really need it, so let go
And let me feed it, but you know
[Pre-Chorus]
That I've been down across a road or two
But now I've found
The velvet sun that shines on me and you
[Chorus]
In the back, ah-ho, I can't crack
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho, I can't fake
We're on top, we're on top
We bring the bump to the grind, ah-ho, I don't mind
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, ah-ho, I can't fake
We're on top, we're on top
[Refrain]
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight
So get your eyes off of my pride tonight
'Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight
It's like a cigarette in the mouth
Or a handshake in the doorway
I look at you and smile because I'm fine, oh
