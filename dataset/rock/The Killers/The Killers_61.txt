[Verse 1]
Can't hear myself think through the crashing of the rain
I'm passing judgement in the fast lane
And smoothing out a rough stone
Guess it comes with age
You start to wonder about the time theft
How much of it you got left
Comes in with the age now
[Chorus]
But when the dreams run dry
I will be where I always was
Standing at your side
Letting go of the reins
We're all going to die
[Verse 2]
When they're closing up the door
Nobody wishing that they worked more
Don't bother with your suitcase
We'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
Or Honolulu on hearsay, running
at our own pace
And I'll be on your side when the dreams run dry
[Chorus]
When the dreams run dry
I will be where I always was
Standing at your side
Letting go of the reins
[Bridge]
Reach for the summit
Of an ancient design
On the verge of eternal
On the heels of divine
If you stumble and fall (If you stumble and fall)
If the way can't be found (If the way can't be found)
[Outro]
We'll just follow the
moon to the stars, to the sun
, to the ground
And around and around and around
In the light, in the heat, through the folds and the bends
And again and again and again
To the moon, to the stars, to the sun, to the ground
And around and around and around
In the light, in the heat, through the folds and the bends
And again and again and again
