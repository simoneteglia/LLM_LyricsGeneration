[Intro]
(Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh)
[Verse 1]
Once in a lifetime,
the suffering of fools
To find our way home, to break in these bones
Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)
Once in a lifetime
[Chorus]
Oh, give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
[Verse 2]
(Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Once in a lifetime, we're breaking all the rules
To find that our home, has long been out grown
Throw me a life line, cause honey I've got nothing to lose
Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)
Once in a lifetime
[Chorus]
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
(Ohohohohoh)
[Bridge]
(Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Look at my reflection in the mirror
Underneath the power of the light
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a shot at the night
Give me a shot at the night
I feel like I'm losing the fight
[Chorus]
Give me a shot at the night, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night
(Ohohohohoh)
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh
Give me a shot at the night (Ohohoh)
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious
Give me a shot at the night (Ohohoh)
Give me a moment (Give me one shot)
Some kinda mysterious (Give one shot at the night)
Give me a shot at the night (Ohohoh)
Give me a moment (Just give me at the moment)
Some kinda mysterious (Give one shot at the night)
Give me a shot at the night (Ohohoh)
