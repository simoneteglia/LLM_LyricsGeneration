[Verse 1]
You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
And when I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light
[Pre-Chorus]
From Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
[Chorus]
Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
For a second there weâ€™d won
Yeah, we were innocent and young
[Verse 2]
Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but
the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life
All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time
[Pre-Chorus]
Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we've got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
[Chorus]
Racing shadows through the moonlight
Taking chances on a hot night
For a second there we won
We were innocent and young
[Verse 3]
The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's a proving ground)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn to chance)
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a loser's game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love
(Miss Atomic Bomb)
[Outro]
Holding on for your life
But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)
When you want it all (A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)
There's another side (Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)
