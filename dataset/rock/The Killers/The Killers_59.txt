[Verse 1]
You're looking for a way out
I can feel it
Come on, show me where it hurts
Maybe I can heal it
Your feelings are your own
Now you keep them under lock and key
You got me driving through the streets
For an answer to the mystery
[Chorus]
The willows still weep on Charleston Avenue
Outside that vacant Starlight Motel
I see you laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
It was a matter of time
[Verse 2]
There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface
Just walking through the front door makes me nervous
It's creeping up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand
I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand
[Chorus]
When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt
Made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out
I was falling back on forever
Then you told me about your heart
You laid it on the line
Laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind
(You laid it on the line)
It was just a matter, It was a matter of time
[Bridge]
We found ourselves a place
We belong in it forever
Ain't that what it's all about?
Make the promise and keep it
Come hell or high water
We'd figure it out
It was the night, it was the moon
It was the green grass in the garden
The victory and the sin
I know you're weary, look at me
Flailing in the corner
Here's the towel
Go on, throw it in
[Chorus]
It was a matter of time
Can't you see that it's tearing me up inside?
Look what's laying at our feet
That's the wreckage of broken dreams
And burned out halos
And it's here on our street
