[Verse 1]
I was a timid Rockwellian boy
She was tattooed and ready to deploy
Gave me reservation and the like
But she could be the dangerous type
But I
threw caution
'cause
something about that yin and the yang
Was pushing my boundaries out beyond my imagining
[Chorus]
While you were out there,
chewing on fat
for probable cause
I let go
While you were out there weighing odds
I was imploding the mirage
While you were out there looking like that
Struck my name from the camouflage
I wasn't lost in the collage
I was imploding the mirage
I was imploding the mirage
[Verse 2]
I had to do it, I had no other choice
You've got to listen to the inside voice
A bullet train will get you there fast
But it won't guarantee a long last
Sometimes it takes a little bit of courage and doubt
To push your boundaries out beyond your imagining
[Chorus]
While you were out there, chewing on fat for probable cause
I let go
While you were out there weighing odds
I was imploding the mirage
While you were out there looking like that
Struck my name from the camouflage
I wasn't lost in the collage
I was imploding the mirage
I was imploding the mirage
[Bridge]
I was spellbound by the show
The matchless power of the glow
I was bound by golden shackles, getting by
She tripped the breaker, blew the fuse
Doesn't need no pair of shoes
Her wings have come, and she's ready for the sky
[Chorus]
While you were out there, chewing on fat for probable cause
I let go
While you were out there weighing odds
I was imploding the mirage
While you were out there looking like that
I walked right out of the camouflage
I wasn't locked in no collage
I was imploding the mirage
I was imploding the mirage
