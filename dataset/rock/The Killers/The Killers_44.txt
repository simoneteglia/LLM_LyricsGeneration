[Verse 1]
I didn't see this comin', I admit it
But if you think I'll buckle, forget it
I told you that I'd be the one
I'll be there in the life to come
[Verse 2]
You think I lost my vision but I didn't
It sounds like heaven, but it isn't
Through fields of amber we will run
Somewhere in the life to come
[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is not a shake down
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me, girl
Just dropkick the shame
Uncover your face, girl
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me
Just drop kick the shame
[Bridge]
Call my name
Call my name
[Chorus]
If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come
[Verse 3]
I know sometimes you think that I regret it
But I don't remember stumblin' when I said it
I told you that I'd be the one
I was talkin  'bout the life to come
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know it ain't a cake walk
(I'm not gonna break down)
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me, girl
Just drop kick the shame
[Chorus]
If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come
If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come
Or the life to come
If you call my name
If you call my name
I will run whether or not it's tonight
Or the life to come
Or the life to come
[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is not a shake down
Let go of the blame
Have a little faith in me, girl
Just drop kick the shame
