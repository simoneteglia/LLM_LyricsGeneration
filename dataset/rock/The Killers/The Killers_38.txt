[Verse]
Aggressively, we all defend the role we play
Regrettably, time's come to send you on your way
We've seen it all, bonfires of trust, flash floods of pain
[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't really matter, don't you worry, it'll all work out
No, it doesn't even matter, don't you worry, that ain't what it's all about
[Chorus]
We hope you enjoyed your stay
It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
We hope you enjoyed your stay
Outside, the sun is shinin'
Seems like heaven ain't far away
It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
[Piano Solo]
[Outro]
It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
Outside, the sun is shinin'
Seems like heaven ain't far away
It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
Outside, the sun is shinin'
Seems like heaven ain't far away
