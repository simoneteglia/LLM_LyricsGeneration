[Intro: Brandon Flowers]
When there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
One more son
If you can, hold on
If you can, hold on, hold on
[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers]
I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meanin' from the back of my broken hand
[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers]
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers & Mark Stoermer]
Help me out, yeah
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
[Verse 3: Brandon Flowers]
And when there's nowhere else to run
Is there room for one more son?
These changes ain't changin' me
The cold-hearted boy I used to be
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down
[Bridge: Brandon Flowers,
with Mark Stoermer
& The Sweet Inspirations
]
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
I got soul but I'm not a soldier
(Time, truth, and hearts)
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers, Mark Stoermer, and The Sweet Inspirations]
Yeah, you know you gotta help me out, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You know you gotta help me out, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
Oh, don't you put me on the back burner
You're gonna bring yourself down, yeah
You're gonna bring yourself down
[Outro: Brandon Flowers,
Mark Stoermer
]
Over and in (
You're gonna bring yourself down
)
Last call for sin (
Bring yourself down
)
While everyone's lost, the battle is won
With all these things that I've done
All these things that I've done
(Time, truth, and hearts)
If you can hold on
If you can hold on
