[Intro]
(Fire in bone)
I felt fire in bone
(Fire in bone)
I felt fire in bone
(Fire in bone)
[Verse 1]
I felt cast out
I felt eighty-sixed
I felt darkness
But I felt fire in bone
I felt no good
I felt lowdown
And I felt alone
I felt unknown
[Refrain]
I felt fire in bone
I felt fire in bone
(Wrongly accused and disowned)
I felt fire in bone
[Verse 2]
I felt big time
I felt major league
I felt weird sin
I felt fire in bone
I felt ripped off
Run down, wrung out
Empty, unseen
And preyed upon
[Refrain]
I felt fire in bone
I felt fire in bone
[Chorus]
When I came back empty-handed
You were waiting in the road
And you fell on my neck
And you took me back home
After all that I took from you
After all that I put you through
Here I am
[Post-Chorus]
I felt fire in bone
[Verse 3]
I felt washed up
I felt tempest-tossed and seasick
But I felt fire in bone
I felt mislead
I felt chained up, unclean, unknown
I felt unknown
[Refrain]
I felt fire in bone
I felt fire in bone
[Chorus]
And they say no one's gonna save you
You gotta make it on your own
But I called from the dark
And you picked up the phone
On my back in the raging blue
I looked up, and you cut right through
And when I came back empty-handed
You met me in the road
And you fell on my neck
And you took me back home
After all that I took from you
After all that I put you through
Here I am
[Outro]
Here I am
Here I am
Here I am
