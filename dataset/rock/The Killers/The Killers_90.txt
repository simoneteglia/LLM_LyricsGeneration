[Verse 1]
Far from the evergreen of old Assam
Far from the rainfall on the trails of old Saigon
Straight from the poster town of scorn and Ritz
To bring you the wilder side of gold and glitz
[Chorus 1]
Run neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They promised just to pet you, but don't you let them get you
Away, away, oh, run
Under heat of the southwest sun
[Verse 2]
Took to the spotlight like a diamond ring
Came from the woodwork in the hopes they might
Redeem themselves from poor decisions to win big
[Chorus 2]
Run neon tiger there's a lot on your mind
They'll strategize and maim you, but don't you let them tame you
You're far too pure and bold
To suffer the strain of the hand and its hold
[Bridge]
I don't want to be kept, I don't want to be caged
I don't want to be damned, oh hell
I don't want to be broke, I don't want to be saved
I don't want to be
S.O.L
Give me rolling hills and tonight can be the night
That I stand among the thousand thrills
Mister cut me some slack, cause I don't want to go back
I want a new day and age
Come on girls and boys, everyone make some noise!
[Chorus 3]
Run neon tiger there's a price on your head
They'll hunt you down and gut you, I'll never let 'em touch you
Away, away, oh, run
I'm begging you neon tiger run
Under the heat of
Under the heat of
Under the heat of southwest sun
[Outro]
Neon tiger
There's a lot on your mind
