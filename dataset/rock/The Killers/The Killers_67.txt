[Intro]
It's just small-town filling and just living the small town an—
Like my kids ride dirt bikes and motorcycles
And they just go across the street in the field and ride
I can watch 'em off my front porch, um
My one boy's into shed-horn hunting
So he'll take off and go park his truck out west and be gone all day, and—
They— The mountains are just in our backyard
That's the nice part about it
[Verse 1]
When I get up, she swears that she don't hear it
Says that I'm as quiet as a mouse
I comb my hair and throw some water on my face
And back out of the stillness of our house
Lately, my patience is in short supply
Nothing good seems to ever come from all this work
No matter how hard I try
[Verse 2]
You know I believe in the Son, I ain't no backslider
But my people were told they'd prosper in this land
Still, I know some who've never seen the ocean
Or set one foot on a velvet bed of sand
But they've got their
treasure laying way up high
Where there might be many mansions
But when I look up, all I see is sky
[Chorus]
Maybe it's the getting by that gets right underneath you
It'd swallow up your every step, boy, if it could
But maybe it's the stuff it takes to get up
In the morning and put another day in, son
That holds you 'til the getting's good
[Bridge]
Green ribbon front doors, dishwater days
This whole town is tied to the torso of God's mysterious ways
[Chorus]
Maybe it's the getting by that gets right underneath you
It'd swallow up your every step, boy, if it could
But maybe it's the stuff it takes to get up
In the morning and put another day in, son
That keeps you standing where you should
So put another day in, son, and hold on 'til the getting's good
[Outro]
Twice a day
Twice a day
Yeah, twice a day it comes through— my grandkids
When it comes through, they run out and they look down the road
Because they like to see it go by
