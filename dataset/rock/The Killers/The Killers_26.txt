[Verse 1]
I drove through the desert last night
I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing don't be cruel, and I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind
[Chorus]
If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?
[Verse 2]
Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust
[Chorus]
If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?
(The way it was, it was)
[Bridge]
All of our plans have fallen through
Sometimes a dream don't come true
[Chorus]
Darling! Darling!
If we go on
Can it be the way it was
When we met did you forget all about them golden nights?
If I go on with you by my side
Can it be the way it was
My heart is true, girl it's just you I'm thinking of
Can it be the way it was?
[Outro]
Maybe a thief stole your heart
