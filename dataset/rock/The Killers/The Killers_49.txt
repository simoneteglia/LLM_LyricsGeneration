[Intro (
Man 1
and
Man 2
)]
Hi, Beth
Oh, I was just calling you to chat with you
I'm probably going to have to get up at the buttcrack of dawn tomorrow
Oh, I hear Patsy backed out on ya tomorrow
Is she—
Damn it, John
(Hmm?)
I lost that frickin’ steel line
(Ugh)
Shit
Okay, it's alright
Go fucking find it
Ah, shit, I'm lookin’ man
(Ha-ha, fuck)
See, I told you my head don't work right
Yeah, you don't have to tell me that
[Verse 1]
I'm in the car, I just needed to clear my head
She's in the house with the baby crying on the bed
She's got this thing where she puts up the walls so high
It doesn't matter how much you love
It doesn't matter how hard you try
[Verse 2]
We got a place with a fence and a little grass
I put this film on the windows
and
it looks like chapel glass
But when shе turns, it’s like the shadow of the cross don’t cast
No blеssing over our lonely life
It's like waiting for a train to pass, I don’t know when it'll pass
[Chorus]
But I remember when she used to set the room on fire
With her eyes
, swear to God
It's like a flood of grief and sorrow from a haunted life
When she
cries, like a train
, it's a lot
[Verse 3]
I dropped a line to a flickering high school flame
We laughed about all the ways that our lives had changed
She’s up the road,
about thirty-five miles north
Got two little boys in school, just had a real bad divorce
And in a moment of weakness
[Chorus]
I told her if she ever needed a helping hand
I would lend, swear to God
It's like the part of me that's screaming not to jump gets lost
In the sound of the train, it's a lot
[Bridge]
Trying hard
Not to cave
Swear to God
[Outro]
I'm in the car outside
I'm in the car outside
I'm in the car outside
I'm in the car outside
