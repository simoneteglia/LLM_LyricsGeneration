[Verse 1]
The emotion it was electric
And the stars, they all aligned
I knew I had to make my decision
But I never made the time
No, I never made the time
[Chorus]
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
[Verse 2]
Exoneration lost his eraser
But my forgiver found the sun
And there are twisted days that I take comfort
Because I'm not the only one
No, I'm not the only one
[Chorus]
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, very far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
[Bridge]
Now there's a majesty at my doorstep
And there's a little boy in her arms
Now we'll parade around without game plans
Obligation or alarm
[Chorus]
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, very far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay much longer
Riding my decision home
In the dark
