[Verse 1]
Give me the eyes that I may see
The good in my people and the trouble in me
Give me the hands that I may lift
The weight of another who's starting to drift
[Chorus]
And if we're running towards a place
Where we'll walk as one
Will the hardness of this life
Be overcome?
If I lay with you in love
Will you meet me there?
And shake the lightning from the locks
Of your unbound hair
Can two become one?
[Verse 2]
Give me a song that I may sing
That cuts like a canyon and rides on a wing
And give a heart that I may stand
For what I believe in
[Chorus]
And if we're running towards a place
Where we'll walk as one
Will the hardness of this life
Be overcome?
If I walk the wild blue
Will you meet me there?
And shake the lightning from the locks
Of your unbound hair
Can two become one?
[Bridge]
Can you see the world
In a grain of sand?
Can you find heaven in a wildflower
Hold it in the palm of your hand?
The moment we met
Burst like a star
Onto the canvas of the skyline, purple and gold
We're in this together, I ain't never letting go
[Chorus]
Because we're running towards a place
Where we'll walk as one
And the sadness of this life
Will be overcome
If I lay with you in love
Will you meet me there?
And shake the lightning from the locks
Of your unbound hair
