[Verse 1]
I pack my case. I check my face
I look a little bit older
I look a little bit colder
With one deep breath, and one big step, I move a little bit closer
I move a little bit closer
For reasons unknown
[Verse 2]
I caught my stride
I flew and flied
I know if destiny’s kind, I’ve got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don’t see you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you no more
[Chorus]
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
[Verse 3]
There was an open chair
We sat down in the open chair
I said if destiny’s kind, I’ve got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don’t see you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you at all
[Chorus]
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
[Bridge]
I said my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to and my eyes don’t recognize you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you no more
[Outro]
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown
