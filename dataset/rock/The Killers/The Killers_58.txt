[Verse 1]
Glamorous indie rock and roll is what I want
It's in my soul, it's what I need
Indie rock and roll, it's time
Two of us flipping through a thrift store magazine
She plays the drums
,
I'm on tambourine
Bet your, your bottom dollar on me
[Chorus]
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need
It's indie rock and roll for me
[Verse 2]
In a clutch, I'm talking every word for all the boys
Electric girls with worn-down toys
Make it up, break it up, what do you care?
Oh, what do you care?
I take my twist with a shout
A coffee shop with a cause,
then I'll freak you out
No sex, no drugs, no life, no love
When it comes to today
[Bridge]
Stay if you want to love me, stay
Oh, don't be shy, let's cause a scene
Like lovers do on silver screens
Let's make it, yeah, we'll cause a scene
[Chorus]
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need
It's indie rock and roll for me
[Outro]
(In a clutch, I'm talking every word for all the boys)
It's indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need
Make it up, break it up, what do you care?
It's indie rock and roll for me
(Two of us flipping through a thrift store magazine)
Indie rock and roll for me
It's all I need
Make it up, break it up, what do you care?
It's indie rock and roll for me
