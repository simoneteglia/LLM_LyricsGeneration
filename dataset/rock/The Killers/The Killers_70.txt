[Verse 1]
Let me wrap myself around you
Let you show me how I see
And when you come back in from nowhere
Do you ever think of me?
Your heart is not able
Let me show you how much I care
I need those eyes to tide me over
I'll take your picture when I go
It gives me strength and gives me patience
But I'll never let you know
I got nothing on you, baby
But I always said I try
Let me show you how much I care
'Cause sometimes it gets hard
And don't she know
[Verse 2]
Don't give the ghost up just clench your fist
You should've known by now you were on my list
Don't give the ghost up just clench your fist
You should've known by now you were on my list
Don't give the ghost up just clench your fist
You should've known by now you were wrong (on my list)
When your heart is not able
And your prayers, theyâ€™re not fables
Let me show you (let me show you)
Let me show you (let me show you)
Let me show you how much I care, oh
