[Verse]
Get your hair cut
Get your money on straight
Get your head right
And don't forget where you come from
Who your friends are and all that shit
[Chorus]
Ever since I could hear
A voice of warning
Stories of pain and fear ringing in my eardrum
And ever since I could run
There's been somebody with a loaded gun
Get your finger on the trigger son
Ringin' in my eardrum
[Verse]
Get your hair cut
Get your money on straight
Get your head right
And don't forget where you come from
Who your friends are and all that shit
[Chorus]
Ever since I could hear
A voice of warning
Stories of pain and fear ringing in my eardrum
And ever since I could run
There's been somebody with a loaded gun
Get your finger on the trigger son
Ringin' in my eardrum
[Verse]
Get your hair cut
Get your money on straight
Get your head right
And don't forget where you come from
Who your friends are and all that shit
[Outro]
I admit I don't understand how this all started
But I know it's gotten out of hand
We can't go back now
Can't just tell ourselves all of this will pass
Not while we're
Sailin' too close, sailin' too close to the wind
Sailin' too close, sailin' too close to the wind
