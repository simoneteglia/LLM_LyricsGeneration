[Intro]
Just give yourself some time
[Verse 1]
Head down
Wrong fit
Big deal
That's just growin' up
Untouched, sixteen
Don't overthink it, boy
White arrows will break
The black night
But don't overthink it, boy
[Chorus]
And when you're out on a ledge
Please come down, boy
There is a place that exists
Just give it some time
Drawn arrows unseen will fly
[Verse 2]
Heat wave, slow lane
Small town
Only diesels dance
These streets weren't meant to house
Jet fuel engine drеams
White arrows will blast
The black night
[Chorus]
And when you'rе out on a ledge
Please come down, boy
There is a place that exists
Just give it some time
Oh, drawn arrows unseen will fly
And break the black night
[Outro]
But don't overthink it, boy
Boy
