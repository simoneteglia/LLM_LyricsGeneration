[Verse 1]
When everybody else refrained
My uncle Jonny did cocaine
[Chorus]
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey, Jonny
Hey what you say Jonny
[Verse 2]
I wanna go out tonight
Come a little closer to the city lights
Levitation ain't your only friend
Levitation coming back again
You feel a burning in your body's core
It's a yearning that you can't ignore
Now I wanna go out tonight
S-s-s-Superman and hold on tight
[Chorus]
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey, Jonny
Hey what you say Jonny
[Verse 3]
My appetite ain't got no heart
I said my appetite ain't got no heart
Shocking people when you feel that pull
Shock 'em, drop 'em when you know it's full
I feel a burning in my body's core
It's a yearning that you can't ignore
Now I gotta go out tonight
Hey Jonny I got faith in you man, I mean it, it's gonna be all right
[Chorus]
He's convinced himself right in his brain
That it helps to take away the pain
Hey, Jonny
Hey what you say Jonny
[Bridge]
Tell us what's going on
Feel's like everything's wrong
Hey what you say Jonny
If the future is real
Jonny, you've got to heal
Hey what you say Jonny
[Outro]
When everybody else refrained
My uncle Jonny did cocaine
