[Verse 1]
She's reaching for her backpack
Puts out a
cigarette
and gets on the bus
She's sittin' on a secret
She didn't ask for, no girl ever did
But there's a whisper in her heartbeat
And she can hear it just enough to keep her alive
When she's breathing in the
blowback
There's nothing
you
can offer she ain't already tried
[Chorus]
But she's breathing in the blowback
Born into poor white trash and always typecast
But she's gonna break out, boy, you'd better know that
It's just a matter of time
She fights back
(Breathing in again)
Breathing in the blowback
[Verse 2]
She is sucking on a Tic-Tac
A good man is a mystery, she's looking for clues
Woah, you'd better check that, buddy
'Cause the blacktop's burning up what's left of the fuse
And she knows where she comes from
Doesn't need you dragging her all through it again
It's like breathing in the blowback
It's a hijack, now how much are you willing to spend?
[Chorus]
But she's breathing in the blowback
Born into poor white trash and always typecast
But she's gonna break out, boy, you'd better know that
It's just a matter of time
She fights back
(Breathing in again)
Breathing in the blowback
[Bridge]
(Breathing in the blowback)
Pinwheels spinning, roller skates and red flags
(Breathing in the blowback)
She's gonna break out, boy, you'd better know that
[Outro]
Can you cast out a demon?
Can you wrangle the wind?
Will you stay when she's breathing the blowback again?
