[Chorus]
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
[Verse 1]
They hug in silence as the sun sets
On their empty street
Her suspicions, well, they're risin' high
And the man who sweeps him off, she doesn't meet
She walks inside and pours a strong one
Put her mind at ease
It's the calm before another storm
And the brain shifts from the whiskey to the keys
[Chorus]
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
[Verse 2]
Her heart is racing, she phones a friend and says
"I'm in an awful place
That fool's been messin' round on me
I've seen it in his eyes and on his face"
Hold on a minute, you're talking crazy
Don't be that jealous girl
Just tell Yvonne you need an hour or two
'Cause we're gonna go and change somebody's world
[Chorus]
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
[Bridge]
It's the calm before another storm
It's the calm before another storm
And her brain shifts from the whiskey to the keys
[Chorus]
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
