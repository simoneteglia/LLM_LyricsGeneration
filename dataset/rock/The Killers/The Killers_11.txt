[Verse 1]
Wheels are turnin'
I remember when you were mine
Just to reach you
Baby, I'd stand in line
But there's another world
You're livin' in tonight
And there's another heart
That's fadin' in the light
[Chorus]
Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't want your memories in my head, no
I want you here with me
[Verse 2]
Spent the summer just layin' out in the sun
Time seems to move so slowly, when you're taking it as it comes
Maybe we were just too young
Your body was tan
and your hair was long
You shot me a smile and my cares were gone
Fallin' in love filled my soul with fright
You said, "Come on, babe, it'll be alright"
I must've been a fool to the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope that I'll have you back again
I'd bargain and I'd fight
But there's another world you're livin' in tonight
[Chorus]
Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory in my head, no
I want you here with me
[Bridge]
Well, I saw you in a restaurant the other day
And instead of walkin' towards you, I ran away (ran away)
I keep on waitin' for you
For you to come around
Come around and say
[Chorus]
I don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't need those memories in my head, no
I want you here with me
Ahhhhh
(Here with me)
Ahhhhh
(Here with me)
