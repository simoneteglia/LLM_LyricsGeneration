[Verse 1]
I've gone through life
White-knuckled in the moments that left me behind
Refusing to heed the yield
I penetrate the force fields in the blind
They say I'll adjust
God knows I must
But I'm not sure how
This natural selection picked me out to be
A dark horse running in a fantasy
[Chorus]
Flesh and bone
Am I running out of time?
Flesh and bone
[Verse 2]
Somewhere outside that finish line
I square up and break through the chains
And I head like a raging bull
Anointed by the blood, I take the reins
Cut from the cloth, of a flag that
Bears the name of "Battle Born"
They call me the contender
Listen for the bell
My face flashing crimson from the fires of hell
What are you afraid of?
[Chorus]
And what are you made of?
Flesh and bone
And I'm running out of time
Flesh and bone
And what are you made of?
Flesh and bone
Man I'm turning on a dime
Flesh and bone
[Bridge]
This could decay
Like the valley below
Defenses are down
The stakes are high
(Scouting the crowd for a face of compassion)
The fairytale end
(To face off the journey that fathers no more)
The staggering blow
(You'll find the truth in the roots of desire)
You lead with your chin
(Thinkin' with your corners, just a compass and the sun)
This could be real
(Thinkin' with your corners, just a)
Simple
[Chorus]
And what are you made of?
(Flesh and bone)
And I'm running out of time
(Flesh and bone)
What are you made of?
[Outro]
He faces forward
Trading in his blindness for the glow of love
And time is raging, may it rage in vain
And you always had it, but you never knew
So boots and saddles, get on your feet
There's no surrender, cause there's no retreat
The bells are sobbing, in this monster land
We are the descendants of giant men
