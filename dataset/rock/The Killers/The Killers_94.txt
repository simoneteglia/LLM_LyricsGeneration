[Verse 1]
Ha, I got to tell you, I'll make it better
But I know that's something I needed to say
When I was out, though
Maybe you were better alone
I know I'll make it home
[Verse 2]
She told me, sweet thing, run a labor in your shoes
Touch me 'til I follow in love
I want to help her
Maybe we were better alone
I want to show you how
[Verse 3]
And then we walked out, make it made now
I said I want it, but I'm never alone
I want to show you
Maybe we were something uncool
I want to make you sing
[Outro]
Uh uh oh
Uh uh oh
Uh uh oh
