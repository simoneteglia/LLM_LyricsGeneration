[Verse]
Comin' out of my cage and I been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm fallin' asleep
and she's callin' a cab
While he's havin' a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
[Pre-Chorus]
But she's touchin' his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killin' me
And takin' control
[Chorus]
Jealousy, turnin' saints into the sea
Swimmin' through sick lullabies
Chokin' on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is callin' me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse]
I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a kiss) It was only a kiss
Now I'm fallin' asleep
and she's callin' a cab
While he's havin' a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
[Pre-Chorus]
But she's touchin' his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killin' me
And takin' control
[Chorus]
Jealousy, turnin' saints into the sea
Swimmin' through sick lullabies
Chokin' on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is callin' me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside

[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
