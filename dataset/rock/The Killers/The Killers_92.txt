[Verse 1]
Woke up to sun streaming in my room
Warm beachfront palm December afternoon
You close your eyes, another year blows by
Somewhere in the wind, just another life
[Verse 2]
My parents sent a Christmas card and tennis shoes
"
We understand you're staying and we're proud of you"
There's a well-rehearsed disinterest in the atmosphere
I don't know if that's what this town gave me or if it led me here
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I played so many parts
I don't know which one's really me
Don't know if I can take
[Chorus 1]
Another Christmas in L.A
.
Another pitcher of Sangria
In an empty beach caf√©
Another Christmas in L.A
.
Hold me tighter, Carmelita
I don't know how long I can stay
[Verse 3]
Left a girl behind in my old man's truck
And sometimes I wonder where she ended up
Maybe she got married, had a couple of kids
Who do you think you're fooling, man? Of course she did
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm walking in
Dan Tana's bar
Try and talk with
Harry Dean
I don't know if I can take
[Chorus 2]
Another Christmas in L.A
.
Another casting call on Thursday
For a job that doesn't pay
Another Christmas in L.A
.
Another burnout in a tank top
Who seems to bask in his decay
A fat protagonist in flip flops
With an extensive resume
From Echo Park to Catalina
[Post-Chorus]
Dreaming of a white Christmas
The one I used to know
Tree tops glisten, children listen
To sleigh bells in the snow
[Outro]
Another Christmas in L.A
.
