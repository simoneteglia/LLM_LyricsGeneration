[Verse 1]
Lift me up on my honor, take me over this spell
Get this weight off my shoulders, I've carried it well
Loose these shackles of pressure, shake me out of these chains
Lead me not to temptation
Hold my hand harder, ease my mind
Roll down the smoke screen and open the sky
[Chorus]
Let me fly
Man, I need a release from this troublesome mind
Fix my feet when they’re stumbling
And well, you know it hurts sometimes
You know it's going to bleed sometimes
[Verse 2]
Dig me out from this thorn tree, help me bury my shame
Keep my eyes from the fire, they can’t handle the flame
Grace cut out from my brothers when most of them fell
I carry it well
[Chorus]
Let me fly
Man, I need a release from this troublesome mind
Fix my feet when they’re stumbling
I guess you know it hurts sometimes
You know it's going to bleed sometimes
Now hold on
I’m not looking for sweet talk, I’m looking for time
Top a tower and sleepwalk
, brother, 'cause it hurts sometimes
You know it's going to bleed sometimes
Hold on
[Bridge]
You know it's going to hurt sometimes
When you call me, hold on
Hold on
Hold on
[Outro]
I’m going to climb that symphony home and make it mine
Let His resonance light my way
See, all these pessimistic sufferers tend to drag me down
So I could use it to shelter what good I’ve found
