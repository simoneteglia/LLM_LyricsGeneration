[Verse 1]
Wiped out, sucking on the fumes of a long-gone flame
Can you leverage love? Can you process pain?
It grabs you by the night
My dreams are big and bathing in light
[Pre-Chorus]
So come on, touch me, I'm a live wire
Wait, don't cover my eyes
When darkness dampens my sight
My dreams are big and bathing in light
[Chorus]
And where does the spirit go? Is it someplace holy?
Is it holy and free?
I don't know if it's true, but I think that I want it
I want it to be
[Post-Chorus]
I want it to be
I want it to be
[Verse 2]
Chalk it up to being young, chalk it up to being dumbed
Down by the creases in the mangled map
Just trying to find the faith to fill the gap
One more time
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll flash God's image 'cross the long night
My dreams are big and bathing in light
So come on, touch me, I'm a live wire
This is a lasting fire
[Chorus]
And where does the spirit go? Is it someplace holy?
Is it holy and free?
I don't know if it's true, but I think that I want it
(I want it)
Where does the spirit go? Is it someplace holy?
Is it holy and free?
I don't know if it's true, but I think that I want it
I want it to be
[Post-Chorus]
I want it to be
[Outro]
So come on, touch me, I'm alive
Come on, is it holy and free?
When darkness dampens my sight
My dreams are big and bathing in light
