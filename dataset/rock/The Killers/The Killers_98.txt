[Verse 1]
It's getting close to sundown
Over the Sierra
Stranded on the heat wave
Burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk
Looking for a nightlife
Talked about the real thing
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Are spilling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a rag top
Takes away my-my pain
[Chorus]
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
Move across the night like a separate wind
(Joy ride)
[Verse 2]
Pulled up to a motel
Vacancy was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settled on the hood
Wrapped her arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumbled in the twilight
And fell onto the floor of the Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door
[Chorus]
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
Move across the night like a separate wind
(Joy ride)
When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
Reaching for the light
More than we can win
(Joy ride)
[Bridge]
There's something in the distance
A glorious existence
A simple celebration
A place you never been before
(Why don't you kiss me?)
Tell me that you want it more
[Chorus]
Reaching for the light
More than we can win
When your chips are down
(When your chips are down)
When your highs are low
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
All your hopes and dreams
All you need to know
Joy ride
(Joy ride)
