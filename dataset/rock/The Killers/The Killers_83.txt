[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers &
Ryan Pardey
]
Oh, Santa
I've been waiting on you
That's funny, kid, because
I've been coming for you
Oh, Santa
I've been killing just for fun
Well, the party's over, kid
Because I, because I got a bullet in my gun
A bullet in your what?
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Santa's got a bullet in his gun (
You know it
)
Santa's got a bullet in his gun
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
I've been a clean living boy, I promise you
Did every little thing you asked me to
I can't believe the things I'm going through
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
Well, no one else around believes me
But the children on the block, they tease me
And I couldn't let 'em off that easy
[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers &
Ryan Pardey
]
Oh, Santa
It's been a real hard year (Year)
There just ain't no getting around this, life is hard
But look at me, I turned out alright
Hey, Santa
Why don't we talk about it? Work it out
Believe me, this ain't what I wanted
I love all you kids, you know that
Hell, I remember when you were just ten years old
Playing out there in the desert
Just waiting for a sip of that sweet Mojave rain
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
In the sweet Mojave rain, the boy was on his own
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
I've been a clean living boy, I promise you
Did every little thing you asked me to
I can't believe the things I'm going through
Hey, Santa Claus
Well, no one else around believes me
But the children on the block, they tease me
And I couldn't let 'em off that easy
[Bridge: Brandon Flowers]
They had it coming, so why can't you see?
I couldn't turn my cheek no longer
The sun is going down and Christmas is near
Just look the other way and I'll disappear forever
Woo!
[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]
Don't shoot me, Santa Claus
Well, no one else around believes me
But the children on the street, they tease me
And I couldn't let 'em off that easy
[Outro: Brandon Flowers]
Believe me
Santa (Santa)
