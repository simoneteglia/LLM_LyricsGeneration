[Intro]
Alright, well, I'm 26 so I've lived here for 26 years
I married my high school sweetheart, so we've been marri—
We've been together 11 years
Um, I don't really travel much so I've just been here, ha-ha
Uh, I'm, I'm busy, John, you'll have to wait
Uh, my little brother, he moved into the community
And they tried to tape him to a flagpole or a tree up at the high school
So if you don't fit their mold—
Just a nice, small community, everybody knows everybody
Good place to live and to raise kids
We'll be here forever
So, yeah, it's a good area
[Verse 1]
I was born right here in Zion, God's own son
His
Holy Ghost stories
and bloodshed never scared me none
While they bowed their heads on Sunday
I cut out through the hedges and fields
Where the
light
could
place its hands on my head
In the
west hills
[Chorus]
Free
in the west hills
Free in the west hills
[Verse 2]
She's got two full-grown children,
one still on the vine
And once I got to know him, I loved him like he was mine
Some nights, we drive up the mouth of the canyon
On hillbilly heroin pills
We get out and watch the sunset
Peaceful and still
[Chorus]
And
free
in the west hills
Free in the west hills
[Verse 3]
When the sheriff kicked my door down
I was sleeping in my own bed
And the mess I got caught up in
Rained hard down on my head
They got me for possession of them hillbilly heroin pills
Enough to kill the horses that run free
in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill the
horses that run
[Chorus]
Free
in the west hills
Free in the west hills
[Verse 4]
If this life was meant for proving
I could use more years to live
But fifteen in a guardhouse
That's more than I'm willing to give
And if there really is a judgement
When He pulls my chart
He'll reject my actions
But He will know my heart
And he'll prepare a place for me
Where happiness instills
And the light puts its loving hands on my head
Free in the west hills
They got me for possession of enough to kill the horses that run
[Chorus]
Free
in the west hills
Free in the west hills
Free, free in the west hills, in the west hills, in the west hills
