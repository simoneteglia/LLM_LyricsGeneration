[Verse]
If I could put my arms around you
Would you remember how it feels
To bask in the glow of my protection?
Stumble and fall head over heels
If I could only find the right words
I'd sweep you off your feet again
You cut the power, but mine is raging
A dreamer 'til the end
[Chorus]
I'm hanging on your side of town
I notice when you're not around
Can't keep my cool, I'm burning inside
A broken heart, beat barely alive
And it's harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's biggеr than love
[Bridge]
The streets are dripping with dеcisions of a quiet kind
Hallucinations on the shoulder of the borderline
With my experience, I'm better off just backing down
Instead of tripping through the pages of your side of town
Serrated edges of the blade are scraping over the leather
I guess we couldn't keep it together
I thought we had it covered forever
[Chorus]
I'm hanging on your side of town
I notice when you're not around
Can't keep my cool, I'm burning inside
A broken heart, beat barely alive
And it's harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's getting harder to breathe
'Cause I couldn't make you believe
What's written in the heavens above
Can't be denied, it's bigger than love
