[Verse 1]
Racey days help me through the hopeless haze
But my, oh, my
Tragic eyes, I can't even recognize myself
Behind
[Chorus 1]
So if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
[Verse 2]
Out again, a siren screams at half-past ten
And you won't let go
While I ignore that we've both felt like this before
It starts to show
[Chorus 2]
So if I have a chance
Would you let me know?
[Bridge]
Why aren't you shakin'?
Step back in time
Graciously taken
Oh, you're too kind
[Chorus 1]
And if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
[Verse 3]
We're all the same
And love is blind
The sun is gone
Before it shines
[Chorus 1]
And I said, if the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
If the answer is no
Can I change your mind?
