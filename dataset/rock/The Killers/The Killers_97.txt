[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
There's no one on the radar
No creature in the grove
No reason to be hateful
Life is a treasure trove
[Chorus]
And peace of mind is easy to find
When the time is right
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come,
I'm callin'
, come
[Verse 2]
We'll take a ship to Cairo
We'll find the Gods, I'm told
I heard the sun is blinding
I hear the streets are gold
[Verse 3]
We'll build a bridge to Eden
And then we'll burn it down
We'll never leave, we'll never die
We'll never turn around
[Chorus 2]
Well peace of mind is easy to find
When the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
[Bridge]
Peace of mind
Peace of mind
When the time is right (When the time is right)
When the time is right (When the time is right)
[Chorus 3]
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
Come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
[Chorus 1]
And peace of mind is easy to find
When the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
[Verse 4]
It's rattling my bones now
It's rushing though my veins
Everything we know is purpose
There's no need to stay in chains
[Verse 5]
You've got to learn to let go
Just let go and I'll let it be
And every fighter goes down
Just slow down and
turn the cheek
[Chorus 4]
Because peace of mind is easy to find
When the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
[Outro]
Peace of mind is easy to find
When the time is right
So come away, come away, come away, come here
Come, I'm callin', come
