[Verse 1]
Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit, they're starting to bust
Drive by your house, nobody's home
I'm tryin' to tell myself that I'm better off alone
[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world, she's just another girl
Another girl
[Verse 2]
I went to see a
fortuneteller
, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losin' my grip
I can't believe you're out there flyin' with somebody else
Uh-uh huh
[Verse 3]
Now Jason's gettin' married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love
[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world, and she's just another girl
[Bridge]
I could be reelin' 'em in left and right
Somethin's got a hold on me, tonight
Well, maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl
All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say, all of my friends say
All of my friends say she's just another girl
[Outro]
Then why can't I sleep at night?
And why don't the moon look right?
The sound's off but the TV's on
And it's a great big world
(
She's just another girl
)
Don't let her stick it to your heart, boy
(
She's just another girl
)
All my friends say she's just another girl
Another girl
