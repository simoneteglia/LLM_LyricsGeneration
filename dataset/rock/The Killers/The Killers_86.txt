[Verse 1]
White demon love song down the hall
White demon shadow on the road
Back up your mind, there is a car
He hears it coming after all, all this time
She likes the way he sings
White demon love songs in her dreams
[Verse 2]
White demon, where's your selfish kiss?
White demon sorrow will arrange
Let's not forget about the fear
Black invitation to a place that cannot change
While strangely holy
Come pouring rain (Darling)
[Chorus]
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
[Verse 3]
Let us be in love (Let us be in love)
Let's do old and gray (Let's do old and gray)
I won't make you cry (I won't make you cry)
I will never stray (I will never stray)
I will do my part (I will do my part)
Let us be in love tonight
[Chorus]
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
White demon, widen your heart's scope
White demon, who let your friends go?
[Outro]
(Stand it anymore, darling)
(Stand it)
(I can't stand it anymore, darling)
(Stand it)
