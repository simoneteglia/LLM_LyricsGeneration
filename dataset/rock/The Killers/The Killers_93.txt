[Verse 1]
She's got her halo and wings hidden under his eyes
But she's an angel for sure, she just can't stop telling lies
But it's too late for his love, already caught in a trap
His angel's kiss was a joke and she is not coming back
[Pre-Chorus]
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
[Chorus]
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[Verse 2]
Yeah, she's got a criminal mind, he's got a reason to pray
His life is under the gun, he's got to hold every day
Now he just wants to wake up, yeah, just to prove it's a dream
'Cause she's an angel for sure, but that remains to be seen
[Pre-Chorus]
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
Keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
[Chorus]
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
[Bridge]
Stupid on the streets of London
James Dean in the rain
Without her it's not the same
But it's alright
[Pre-Chorus]
Because heaven sends and heaven takes
Crashing cars in his brain
And keep him tied up to a dream
And only she can set him free
And then he says to me
[Chorus]
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now
Again and again
