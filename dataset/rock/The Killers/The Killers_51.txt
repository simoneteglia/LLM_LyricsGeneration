[Verse 1]
You lost faith in the human spirit
You walk around like a ghost
And your star-spangled heart
Took a train for the coast
And when you shine, you're a hilltop mansion
So how'd you lose the light?
Was it blown by the wind
In the still of the night?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're up against the wall
[Chorus 1]
Up against the wall
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down
You're gonna to get back on your feet
('Cause you can't stop now)
[Verse 2]
I always saw you as a kind of keeper
A mother to a child
But your boys have grown soft
And your girls have gone wild
From the Blue Ridge to the Black Hills
To the Redwood sky
The season may pass
But the dream doesn't die
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now don't you drop the ball
[Chorus 2]
Up against the wall
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down
You're gonna to get back on your feet
(But you can't stop now)
And when they break your heart
And when they cause your soul to mourn
Remember what I said
"Boy, you was battle born"
(But you can't stop now)
[Post-Chorus]
You was battle born
[Bridge]
And when the night falls on the land
Are you haunted by the sound?
It's going to take more than a hand
To turn this thing around
Won't you lean it on me?
Rescue, set me free
[Chorus 3]
You're up against the wall (up against the wall)
There's something dying on the street
When they knock you down (up against the wall)
You're gonna to get back on your feet
('Cause you can't stop now, 'cause you can't stop now)
And did they break your heart? (did they break your heart?)
And did they cause your soul to mourn? (cause your soul to mourn?)
Remember what I said (remember what I said)
"Boy, you was battle born"
(you were battle born)
('Cause you can't stop now, 'cause you can't stop now)
Come on show your face (come on, show your face)
Come on give us one more spark (give us one more spark)
We'll sing your song of fire
(we'll sing your song of fire)
Lest we fall into the dark
(fall into the dark)
('Cause you can't stop now, no, you can't stop now)
[Outro]
You never live, you never learn
You never shine if you never burn
A rising tide, the undertow
The famine and the overflow
Well, turn away, welcome home
