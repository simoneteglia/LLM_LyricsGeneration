[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:26]
[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
I won't take long, just watch and see how the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new, but the face the same as it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows
[Verse 2]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above
[Bridge]
People talkin all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind if you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah
I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me
Give it
[Instrumental Break 02:02-03:41]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Mm, work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried
Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker
[Outro]
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!
