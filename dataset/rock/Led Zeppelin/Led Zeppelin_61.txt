[Verse 1]
In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
Oh, but the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity, baby
No, no, she don't make no rules
[Chorus]
Oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have
[Verse 2]
So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
Oh, from the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness
No, don't ask nobody's help
Oh, ain't no pockets full of mercy, baby
Because you can only blame yourself
[Chorus]
Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, need your love
Ooh, yeah, I need your love
I got to have
[Verse 3]
Ooh, it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune, fortune
Because that's all that's left to you
Hey, it's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle, oh, oh, kh
Ain't no way you're gonna stop
Oh, baby
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I've got to have
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
[Verse 4]
Ooh, whatever
That your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner, oh, no
'Cuse that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
Whell, you don't expect a lot, oh
[Chorus]
Oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Ooh, yeah, I need your love
I've got to have, I've got to have
[Outro]
Aw, baby, I've got to have your love
I've got to have
Oh, babe, I've got to have your love
Oh, oh, have your love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I've got to have your love
Just got to
I just got
I just got to, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
