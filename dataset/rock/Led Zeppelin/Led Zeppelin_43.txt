[Verse 1]
Greased and slicked down fine
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road
Mama, it ain't no sin
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
[Verse 2]
Ooh, trouble-free transmission
Helps your oils flow
Mama, let me pump your gas
Mama, let me do it all
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
[Verse 3]
Check that heavy metal
Underneath your hood
Baby, I can work all night
Believe I got the perfect tools
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
[Verse 4]
A model built for comfort
Really built with style
Specialist tradition
Mama, let me feast my eyes
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
[Verse 5]
Factory air-conditioned
Heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours
Mama, it's the perfect size
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
[Verse 6]
Grooving on the freeway
Gauge is on the red
Gun down on my gasoline
Believe I'm gonna crack a head
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout...
I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about
Ooh, yeah, yes
Drive on
[Keyboard Solo]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes
I'm coming through
[Verse 7]
Come to me for service
Every hundred miles
Baby, let me check your points
Fix your overdrive
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
I'm talking 'bout love
I'm talking 'bout
[Verse 8]
Ooh yeah, fully automatic
Comes in any size
Makes me wonder what I did
Before we synchronized
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
I'm talking 'bout
[Verse 9]
Oooh, feather-light suspension
Konis couldn't hold
I'm so glad I took a look
Inside your showroom doors
[Refrain]
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout love
Talking 'bout
Oh, I can't
Oh, I can't
[Outro]
Oh, I can't stop talking about love
I can't stop talking about love
Ooh, let me go on down, go on down
Go on down, go on down, go on down, yeah
I can't stop talking about
I can't stop talking about love, oh yeah
I can't stop talking about love or my baby
I can't stop talking about love, my baby
My baby, my baby, yeah
Push, push
Push it
Push, push
Oooooooohhh
