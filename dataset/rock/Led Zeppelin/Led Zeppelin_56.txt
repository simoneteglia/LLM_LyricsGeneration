[Verse 1]
Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems that pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go
[Chorus]
My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We' gonna dance and sing in celebration
We're in the promised land
[Verse 2]
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door
Her name is Brown or White or Black
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell
[Chorus]
My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band, yeah
We' gonna sing and dance in celebration
We're in the promised land
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Oooh, there is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more. Yes, it has!
And if you walk, you're gonna get there
And though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan, oh, yeah, moan
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, moan moan
[Ad libs continue]
[Outro]
If you walk you're gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan...
