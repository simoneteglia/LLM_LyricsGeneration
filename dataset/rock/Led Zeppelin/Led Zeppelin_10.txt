[Verse 1]
Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rollin'
Leave you when the summer comes along
[Verse 2]
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby
Baby, I wanna leave you
I ain't joking' woman, I've got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believin'

I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do
I can hear it callin' me back home
[Bridge]
Oh, babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know

Oh, I can hear it callin' me
I said don't you hear it callin' me the way it used to do?

I know, I know, I know I never, never, never, never, never
Gonna leave you, babe
But I got to go away from this place
I've got to quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Back home
