[Verse 1]
Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes, you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
It sounds so good, oh, so good
[Chorus]
With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness, hey
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground
[Verse 2]
And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh, so good
Baby, if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh, so much good
[Chorus]
With a little bit of stop-a-shaking, shaking
And a little bit of fly right down
Woo, just a little bit of sweet con-carne, yeah
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Ooh, now baby, a-when you move, it makes me, yeah
Really feel so good, oh, so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good
[Chorus]
With a little bit of, ooh, ah, concentration
Just a little bit of a-helping hands, yeah
With a little bit of raving madness
It makes me feel, oh-ho, it makes me feel
I'm back on the ground
Oh, yes, it sure does
It makes me feel, hey, yeah, back on the ground
Suarez! Suarez!
Baby, baby, you back on the ground, yeah!
