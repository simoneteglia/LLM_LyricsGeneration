[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
[Verse 2]
Hear my song, yeah
People, don't you listen now?
Sing along, oh
You don't know what you're missing now
[Verse 3]
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now
Push, push, yeah
[Verse 4]
Na-na-na-na-na
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same, oooh, oooh, ooh
(Get it on)
[Bridge]
Oh, keep on
All you gotta do, all you gotta do
All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
[Verse 5]
Ooh, sing out
Hare Hare
Ooh,
dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh-so bright
As we go sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
[Outro]
Ahhhhhhh
[Verse 1]
I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
[Verse 2]
Hear my song, yeah
People, don't you listen now?
Sing along, oh
You don't know what you're missing now
[Verse 3]
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now
Push, push, yeah
[Verse 4]
Na-na-na-na-na
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu starbright
The song remains the same, oooh, oooh, ooh
(Get it on)
[Bridge]
Oh, keep on
All you gotta do, all you gotta do
All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
[Verse 5]
Ooh, sing out
Hare Hare
Ooh,
dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh-so bright
As we go sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
[Outro]
Ahhhhhhh
