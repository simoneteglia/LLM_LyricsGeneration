[Verse 1]
There was a time I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy, woman, talking for hours and hours on the telephone
Then one day I set you up to walk right out of my life
Leaving me all by myself, all alone, to cry every night
[Chorus]
(Babe, babe, babe)
Oooh, I want you to come back home, yeah
(Come on home, oooh yeah) Sweet little girl (Been gone too long)
Been away so long
[Verse 2]
Now listen to me: I said I made up my mind
Woman, when you left me there, oh
I was going to find another sweet lover
Who is going to feel all of my, all of my, all of my cares
So I met a sweet little girl, just about as nice as she could be, oh
I fell in love with that woman, but she turned around
And did the same thing again to me, ooh
[Chorus]
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
Oh, baby, baby, please come home
, oh, yeah, darling
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
I know, been away so long
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
I want you to please come home, oh
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
[Verse 3]
So I made up my mind, I'm going to crawl right back to you, woman
I'm going to plead and plead and plead, yeah, till you're here by my side
I can't even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
Because I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinking about it, I want to make you mine
[Chorus]
Oh, babe, babe, babe, please come home, yeah (Come on home)
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
I want you to, ahhhh
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
I want you to come back right at home to me, woman
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
I want you to think about when we walk through the trees together
You know, we had such a real good time, whoa
Here we go, ...leaves always falling
(Babe, babe, babe, come on home)
You feel a brown leaf against your face
You want to sing and shout
(Oh yeah, you been gone too long)
Baby, baby, baby
[Verse 1]
