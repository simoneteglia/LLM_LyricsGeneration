[Verse 1]
Dancing days are here again
As summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows
[Chorus]
I said it's all right, you know it's all right
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
[Verse 2]
Crazy ways are evident
In the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow
[Chorus]
You know it's all right, I said it's all right
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig
[Verse 3]
You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar
[Chorus]
You know it's all right, I said it's all right
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
[Verse 1]
So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows
[Chorus]
I said it's all right, you know it's all right
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, yes, my one and only, yes
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is, yeah!
[Verse 1]
Dancing days are here again
As summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows
[Chorus]
I said it's all right, you know it's all right
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
[Verse 2]
Crazy ways are evident
In the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow
[Chorus]
You know it's all right, I said it's all right
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

You told your mama I'd get you home

You know it's all right, I said it's all right
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
