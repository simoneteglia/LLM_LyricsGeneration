[Verse 1]
You need cooling
Baby, I'm not fooling
I'm gonna send you back to schooling
Way down inside
Honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love, oh

Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love
Wanna whole lotta love

Way, way down inside
Honey, you need it
