[Verse 1]
As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way
Helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh so strong
[Verse 2]
I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
And blows my blues away
There's nothing more that I can say
But on a day like today I pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you
[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
[Verse 3]
I'm so glad I'm leaving
Gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman
And she says that I'm her man
One thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the loving
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can
[Verse 4]
Standing in the noonday sun
Trying to flag a ride
People go, and people come
See my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace
It must be a race, and the best thing I can do is run
[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
[Outro]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
Oh, da da da 70 more
All I do is say let's keep on
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Aah ah ah yeah yeah
Aaaahhh yeah yeah
[Verse 1]
As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way
Helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
And blows my blues away
There's nothing more that I can say
But on a day like today I pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you
[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
Oooh yeah, oooh yeah
