[Intro]
[Verse 1]
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, the levee's going to break
[Chorus 1]
When the levee breaks, have no place to stay
[Verse 2]
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
[Chorus 2]
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well, ooh
[Bridge 1]
Oh, don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go
If you're going down south, they got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago
Ah, ah, ah, hey
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
[Chorus 3]
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move, ooh
[Verse 4]
All last night I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night, sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby and my happy home
Oh-ho
[Bridge 2]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Oh, oh
[Outro]
Going
I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you
, ah
Going down, going down now
Going down,
I'm going down now
Going down, going down
Going down, going down
Oh...
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going, dow- dow- dow- dow- down, now
Ooh, ooh
