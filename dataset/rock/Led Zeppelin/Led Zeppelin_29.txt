[Verse 1]
I should have quit you long time ago
Ohh, yeahhh, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor
[Verse 2]
I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Every time I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line
Oh..
[Instrumental Break]
[Instrumental Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Babe, yeah
Give it to me, baby
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my
I'll take it down a little bit
People tell me, baby
Can't be satisfied
Tryin' to worry me, baby, but I'd never get you with myself
Keep on worrying, baby
Can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tell you, baby
You ain't nothing but a two-bit, no-good jive...
[Verse 4]
I went to sleep last night, I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money
You take my money
Give it to another man
I should have quit you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago, oh
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles
Down on this killing floor
[Verse 5]
Squeeze me, baby, till the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me, baby, till the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, ah
I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Bed, bed, bed, yeah
[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh
[Instrumental Chorus]
[Outro]
I'm going to leave my children down on this killing floor
[Verse 1]
I should have quit you long time ago
Ohh, yeahhh, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor
[Verse 2]
I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Every time I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line
Oh..
[Instrumental Break]
[Instrumental Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Babe, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh
