[Verse 1]
It's not cold enough
Please put this end up
She is moving through
Can we show our faces now?
[Verse 2]
I'm not interesting
She's not turning green
Shameful as it seems
Can we show our faces now?
[Chorus]
Endless climb
I am blind
Why can't I hear?
Color blind
Speaking a phrase
Instantly grown
I am blind
Waiting in line
[Verse 3]
It's not cold enough
Please put this side up
She is moving through
Can we show our faces now?
[Verse 4]
I'm not interesting
She's not turning green
Shameful as it seems
Can we show our faces now?
[Chorus]
Endless climb
I am blind
Why can't I hear?
Color blind
Speaking a phrase
Instantly grown
I am blind
Why am I sure?
[Verse 1]
It's not cold enough
Please put this end up
She is moving through
Can we show our faces now?
[Verse 2]
I'm not interesting
She's not turning green
Shameful as it seems
Can we show our faces now?
[Chorus]
Endless climb
I am blind
Why can't I hear?
Color blind
Speaking a phrase
Instantly grown
I am blind
Waiting in line
[Verse 3]
It's not cold enough
Please put this side up
She is moving through
Can we show our faces now?
[Verse 4]
I'm not interesting
She's not turning green
Shameful as it seems
Can we show our faces now?
[Chorus]
Endless climb
I am blind
Why can't I hear?
Color blind
Speaking a phrase
Instantly grown
I am blind
Why am I sure?
