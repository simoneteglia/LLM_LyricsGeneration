[Verse 1]
I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven flight
Nurse my greed, crease infold
Is it me, or my ego?
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or storyline
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude?
[Chorus]
If you want to put off an image
The extremes, the extremes
Act it out, practicing
Perfecting, pressuring
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
[Verse 2]
I will wait in a phylum
To explain your asylum
I am tired analyzing
We'll compare all our sizings
If you must
[Bridge]
I speak
To hear
My voice
[Verse 1]
I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven flight
Nurse my greed, crease infold
Is it me, or my ego?
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or storyline
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude?
[Chorus]
If you want to put off an image
The extremes, the extremes
Act it out, practicing
Perfecting, pressuring
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
[Verse 1]
I can read, I can write
I can breed, proven flight
Nurse my greed, crease infold
Is it me, or my ego?
Write some words, make them rhyme
Thesis or storyline
Set the mood, something new
Is it me, or my attitude?
[Chorus]
If you want to put off an image
The extremes, the extremes
Act it out, practicing
Perfecting, pressuring
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
[Verse 2]
I will wait in a phylum
To explain your asylum
I am tired analyzing
We'll compare all our sizings
If you must
[Bridge]

If you want to put off an image
The extremes, the extremes

Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
Onto me
