[Verse 1]
And if you save yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breather holes
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you in grass
Then you'll think you're happy now
[Chorus]
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you, oh
[Verse 2]
And if you cut yourself
You will think you're happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll make him happy
He'll give you breather holes
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you in grass
Then you'll think you're happy now
[Chorus]
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you, oh
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you, oh
[Verse 3]
And if you fool yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breather holes
Then you will seem happy
You'll wallow in your shit
Then you'll think you're happy now
[Chorus]
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you, oh
[Verse 1]
And if you save yourself
You will make him happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll give you breather holes
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you in grass
Then you'll think you're happy now
[Chorus]
You're in a laundry room
You're in a laundry room
Conclusion came to you, oh
[Verse 2]
And if you cut yourself
You will think you're happy
He'll keep you in a jar
Then you'll make him happy
He'll give you breather holes
Then you'll think you're happy
He'll cover you in grass
Then you'll think you're happy now
