[Verse 1]
Silence, here I am!
Here I am, silent!
Bright and clear, it's what I am!
I have died!
[Chorus]
Mother, Mother
Mother, Mother
[Verse 2]
Death! And violence!
Excitement, right here!
Died! Go to Hell!
Here I am, right here!
Ow!
[Chorus]
No más, no más
No más, Mama
[Verse 3]
Death is what I am!
Go to Hell, go to jail!
In back of that crime!
Here I am, take a chance!
Dead!
Die
[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
Mother, Mother
Mother, Mother
[Verse 2]
Death! And violence!
Excitement, right here!
Died! Go to Hell!
Here I am, right here!
Ow!

No más, no más
No más, Mama
[Verse 3]
Death is what I am!
Go to Hell, go to jail!
In back of that crime!
Here I am, take a chance!
Dead!
Die
