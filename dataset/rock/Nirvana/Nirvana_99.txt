[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high I scratched 'till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
[Verse 2]
My brother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
[Bridge]
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
[Verse 3]
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, and I can go home
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
[Spoken]
Oh yeah, I need you to do a little beat, so I can keep time
You hear that?
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words

The finest day that I've ever had

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Yeah
