[Verse 1]
Afraid to grade, wouldn't it be fun?
Cross, self-loss, wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed, wouldn't it be fun?
Some fear none, wouldn't it be fun?
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Preacher said
[Chorus]
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
[Verse 2]
Spell the smell, wouldn't it be fun?
Search for church, wouldn't it be fun?
And wet your bed, wouldn't it be fun?
Cold and coals, wouldn't it be fun?
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, preacher said
Preacher said
[Chorus]
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
[Verse 1]
Afraid to grade, wouldn't it be fun?
Cross, self-loss, wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed, wouldn't it be fun?
Some fear none, wouldn't it be fun?
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Preacher said
[Chorus]
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
[Verse 2]
Spell the smell, wouldn't it be fun?
Search for church, wouldn't it be fun?
And wet your bed, wouldn't it be fun?
Cold and coals, wouldn't it be fun?
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, teacher said
Your eyes, preacher said
Preacher said
[Chorus]
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you, don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
