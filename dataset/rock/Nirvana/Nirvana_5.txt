[Verse 1]
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch
[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
[Verse 2]
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few
[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
[Verse 3]
Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me, the will of instinct
[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip, dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
[Verse 1]
Polly wants a cracker

Isn't me, have a seed

Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
