[Verse 1]
I can't hide, no, on the mantle
I'm not sad until I'm home
It's the season, I'm all reason
I have seen all I have grown
[Chorus]
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
And not seen
And not seen
And not seen
Cheat on me
At the seams
[Verse 2]
I'm a lantern, I'm a planter
I set something in the garden
In the handle, on the mantle
I love Santa, I met God
[Chorus]
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
At the seams
At the seams
At the seams
Cheat on me
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I'm a lady
Can you save me?
It's the sulfur
I have grown
'Tis the season
I'm all reason
I have fleas
So run on home
[Chorus]
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
At the seams
At the seams
Cheat on me
[Verse 1]
I can't hide, no, on the mantle
I'm not sad until I'm home
It's the season, I'm all reason
I have seen all I have grown
[Chorus]
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
And not seen
And not seen
And not seen
Cheat on me
At the seams
[Verse 2]
I'm a lantern, I'm a planter
I set something in the garden
In the handle, on the mantle
I love Santa, I met God
[Chorus]
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
At the seams
At the seams
At the seams
Cheat on me
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I'm a lady
Can you save me?
It's the sulfur
I have grown
'Tis the season
I'm all reason
I have fleas
So run on home
[Chorus]
Sheared at the seams
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
Cheat on me
At the seams
At the seams
Cheat on me
