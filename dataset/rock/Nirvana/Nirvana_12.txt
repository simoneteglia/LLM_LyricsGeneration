[Verse 1]
Truth covered insecurity
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Tradin' off and takin' turns
I don't regret a thing
[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I
[Post-Chorus]
Still
Smell her on you
[Verse 2]
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowin' fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fightin' jealousy
Until it's fucking gone
[Chorus]
I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I
[Post-Chorus]
Still
Smell her on you
[Verse 1]
Truth covered insecurity
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Tradin' off and takin' turns
Don't regret a thing
[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We'll make a pact to learn from who
Ever
we want without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way to prove they
[Post-Chorus]
Still
Smell her on you
They still
Smell her on you
[Outro]
Smell her on you
[Verse 1]
Truth covered insecurity
I can't let you smother me

And I've got this friend, you see, who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
