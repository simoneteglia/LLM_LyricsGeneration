[Intro]
(Mmm)
(What's your name?
Do you like me?)
[Verse 1]
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne-ed with cigarette burns
Speak at once while takin' turns
[Chorus]
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
[Verse 2]
Nothing to do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne-ed with cigarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns
[Chorus]
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?
[Bridge]
Hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
And speak, speak the truth
[Chorus]
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What do I think I think?
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
[Chorus]
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What is what I need?
What do I think I think?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?
