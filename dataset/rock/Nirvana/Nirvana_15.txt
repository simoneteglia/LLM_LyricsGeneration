[Spoken Intro]
[Verse 1]
I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
[Chorus]
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free (I do)
[Verse 2]
(I do) I'm standin' in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number too
I do keep a date with you
[Chorus]
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

I do, but you have a clue
[Chorus]
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No, I can't see you every night
Free
[Outro]
I do
I do
I do
