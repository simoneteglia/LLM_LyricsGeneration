[Spoken Intro]
*Applause*
Good evening
This is off of our first record
Most people don't own it
*Applause*
[Verse 1]
I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
[Chorus]
Take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night, free
I do
[Verse 2]
I'm standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number too
I do keep a date with you
[Chorus]
Take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night, free
I do
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue
[Chorus]
Take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No I can't see you every night
Free, I do
[Outro]
I do
I do
I do
