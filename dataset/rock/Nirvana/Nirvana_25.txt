[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphins
[Pre-Chorus]
Doll steak
Test meat
[Chorus]
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight, I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping
[Verse 2]
I own my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit is her milk
[Pre-Chorus]
Test meat
Doll steak
[Chorus]
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight, I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Doll steak
Test meat
[Chorus]
Look on the bright side, suicide
Lost eyesight, I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping
[Outro]
Protector of the kennel
Ecto-plasma, ecto-skeletal
Obituary birthday
Your scent is still here in my place of recovery
