[Verse]
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say
[Chorus]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
[Verse]
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say
[Chorus]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse]
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say
[Chorus]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
[Verse]
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say
[Chorus]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
[Verse]
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say
[Chorus]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse]
Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again
Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say
[Chorus]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
