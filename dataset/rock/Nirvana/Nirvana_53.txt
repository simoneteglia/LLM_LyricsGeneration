[Verse 1]
It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing
That you're only supposed to use once and then discard
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend
My shyness, pet her flow
[Chorus]
She's only been five months late
Even though we haven't had sex for a week
A meal a day, a meal, I say
And my heart's made, my—
[Verse 2]
Somebody else already used the word 'aurora borealis'
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer
[Chorus]
She's only five weeks late
But I haven't had a date forever
Ever
Ever
Forever
[Verse 3]
Wish I had more
More opportunity
More chances to remember some things
So I couldn't have so much pressure on my—
On my, on my, um—(Ooh)
Uh, on my
Um, um
Head
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
We'd have so much more diversity
And so much more input
So much more creative flow
If we had someone in school, a G-I-T
G-I-T
Geeks in town (Ha)
Come on, Dave, think of one (
Girls in trouble
)
It should be GIC, geeks with charvels
No, GWC
Fuck, man, this is a waste of time
[Interlude]
A-hahaha
Hahaha
One more solo?
Yeah! Yeah!
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
You're—personally responsible for
The entire strip to be washed away
Cleansed, as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire
It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight
And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom
And his silk
And he—
He erected a beautiful city
A city of stars
