[Refrain]
She seems to think
She seems too weak
She takes a week to get over it
She likes the sea
She likes to see
She likes to think she has all of it
She likes the sound
She likes the sand
She likes to stand, she can't afford to sit
She likes to be
She likes to be
She likes to be
[Bridge]
She's into guilt
Guilt
Guilt
Guilt
[Verse]
She likes to think
She likes to drink
She seems too weak, she takes all the rent
She likes the time
She owns the time
She borrows time to self-invent
She seems too weak
She likes to see
She likes to think she has all of it
She likes the sand
She likes to stand
She likes to sit
[Chorus]
She likes to go
Go
Go
Go
Go
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
She seems to think

She likes to be
She likes to be
She likes to be
[Chorus]
She likes to go
Go
