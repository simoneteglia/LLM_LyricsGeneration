[Verse 1]
Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice
[Chorus]
Hey, away!
Go away!
Go away!
[Verse 2]
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers
[Chorus]
Hey, away!
Go away!
Go away!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leakin' out gas fumes are made into perfume
You can't fire me 'cause I quit
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
[Chorus]
Hey, away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
[Verse 1]
Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice
[Chorus]
Hey, away!
Go away!
Go away!
[Verse 2]
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers
[Chorus]
Hey, away!
Go away!
Go away!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leakin' out gas fumes are made into perfume
You can't fire me 'cause I quit
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
[Chorus]
Hey, away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
