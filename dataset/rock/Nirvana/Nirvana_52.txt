Big cheese, make me
Mine says, go to the office
Big cheese, make me
Mine says, one that stays
[Chorus]
Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
Show you all what a man is
[Verse 2]
Big lies make my
Mine says, go to the office
Big cheese, make me
Message, what is it
[Chorus]
Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
She eats glue, how 'bout you?
[Guitar Solo]
Woo!
[Verse 3]
Big cheese, make me
Mine says, go to the office
Big cheese, make me
Mine says, one that stays
[Chorus]
Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
She eats glue, how 'bout you?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
Show you all what a man is
She eats glue, how 'bout you?
Show you all what a man is
