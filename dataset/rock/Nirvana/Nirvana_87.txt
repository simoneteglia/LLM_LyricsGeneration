[Verse 1]
Come out and play
Make up the rule
I know, I hope
To die from you
To some I'm dead
I'll walk from you
I know, the lie
The way to go
[Pre Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello!
[Chorus]
I'm a liar, and I'm famous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A libido, an albino
A mulatto, a mosquito
Here we are now, entertain us
We'll feel stupid, and famous
[Post Chorus]
Yeah!
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
[Verse 2]
Come out, outside
Look up the view
I know, right now
The cloud is blue
When I'm away
Don't have a feel
Well go outside
And pray for me
[Pre Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello
[Chorus]
I'm a liar, and I'm famous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid, and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
An albino, a mulatto
A libido, a mosquito
Here we are now, entertain us
We feel stupid and famous
[Post Chorus]
Yeah!
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Come out and play
Take off your clothes
Make up the rules
I'll see you in court
And I will not embrace you
And I'll lie, the same as you
[Pre Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello, how low?
Hello, hello, hello!
[Chorus]
I'm a liar and famous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid, and we're famous
Here we are now, entertain us
A libido, an albino
A mosquito, a vagina
Here we are now, entertain us
We feel stupid, and famous
