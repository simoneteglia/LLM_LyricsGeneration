[Verse 1: B. Lewis]
Get you, get you on the floor
Kitchen table, say no more
Got you up against the door
Run it up 'til the morning
Never trippin', on the low
Hit it fast, hit it slow
Run it up 'til the morning
[Chorus: B. Lewis]
I just gotta know
Can we do this on the low
Take it fast or take it slow
Really doesn't matter anymore, baby
[Post-Chorus: Bas and B. Lewis]
Every time, my favorite times are wastin' time with you
Love you sober, love you older, love you always, through
Forever might not need no wedding ring
Nowhere I'd rather be but here with you
This world, the seven seas, the Heavens too
No part of it I see compare with you
[Chorus: B. Lewis]
I just gotta know
Can we do this on the low (Oh)
Take it fast or take it slow
Really doesn't matter anymore, baby
[Verse 2: Bas]
Yeah
That's a fact, scientific
What's a Jordan with no Scottie Pippen?
I'll be Scottie, baby, you the greatest
Got no problems givin' you the praises
Cop a drop for you, the new Mercedes
You deserve the latest
Bein' honest, I could loop you daily
Baby, you is something like my favorite playlist
But I could never play you like the stereo from Shea Stadium
It ain't Shea Stadium, but these days
It ain't rented and it auto-park
And she got back like a photobomb
Throw that ass back, no photoshop
Independent, had to shoot my shot (Ayy)
Uber Eats, big movie screens
Shit, fuck, and sleep
I could do this all day
[Chorus: B. Lewis]
I just gotta know
Can we do this on the low (Oh)
Take it fast or take it slow
Really doesn't matter anymore, baby
[Post-Chorus: Bas and B. Lewis]
Every time, my favorite times are wastin' time with you
Love you sober, love you older, love you always, through
Forever might not need no wedding ring
Nowhere I'd rather be but here with you
This world, the seven seas, the heavens too
No part of it I see compare with you
[Verse 1: B. Lewis]
Get you, get you on the floor

Run it up 'til the morning

Take it fast or take it slow
