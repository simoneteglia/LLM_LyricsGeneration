[Verse 1]
What is this song all about?
Can't figure any lyrics out
How do the words to it go?
I wish you'd tell me, I don't know
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no
Don't know, don't know, don't know...
[Chorus]
Now I'm mumblin', and I'm screamin'
And I don't know what I'm singin'
Crank the volume, ears are bleedin'
I still don't know what I'm singin'
We're so loud and incoherent
Boy, this oughta bug your parents
Yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Blergh
Haai
[Verse 2]
It's unintelligible
I just can't get it through my skull
It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss
With all these marbles in my mouth
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no
Don't know, don't know, don't know
[Chorus]
Well, we don't sound like Madonna
Here we are now, we're Nirvana
Sing distinctly, we don't wanna
Buy our album, we're Nirvana
A garage band from Seattle
Well, it sure beats raisin' cattle
Yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Moo
Baaaa
[Gargling, Kazoo and Tuba Solo]
[Verse 3]
And I forgot the next verse
Oh well, I guess it pays to rehearse
The lyric sheet's so hard to find
What are the words? Oh, never mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no
Don't know, don't know, don't know
[Chorus]
Well, I'm yellin', and we're playin'
But I don't know what I'm sayin'
What's the message I'm conveyin'?
Can you tell me what I'm sayin'?
So, have you got some idea?
Didn't think so, well, I'll see ya
[Outro]
Sayonara, sayonara
Ayonawa, hodinawa
Odinaya, yodinaya
Yaddayadda, yaaahyaaah
Ayiyaaaaaah!
