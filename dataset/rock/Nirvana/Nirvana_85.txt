[Verse 1]
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
[Chorus]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
[Verse 2]
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
[Chorus]
I'm so tired I can't sleep
I’m anemic royalty
I’m a liar and a thief
I’m anemic royalty
[Verse 3]
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids
[Chorus]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
[Spoken]
That sounded good
Shut up
[Verse 1]
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
[Chorus]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
[Verse 2]
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
[Chorus]
I'm so tired I can't sleep
I’m anemic royalty
I’m a liar and a thief
I’m anemic royalty
[Verse 3]
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids
[Chorus]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
[Spoken]
That sounded good
Shut up
