[Verse 1]
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud
[Verse 2]
Show me how you question questions
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud
[Pre-Chorus]
Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyways
Seal it in a box
[Chorus]
I'm you
I'm you
[Verse 1]
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud
[Verse 2]
Show me how you question questions
Lead the way to my temptation
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud
[Pre-Chorus]
Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyways
Seal it in a box
[Chorus]
I'm you
I'm you
I'm you
I'm you, ah!
[Verse 1]
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud
[Verse 2]
Show me how you question questions
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud
[Pre-Chorus]
Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyways
Seal it in a box
[Chorus]
I'm you
I'm you
