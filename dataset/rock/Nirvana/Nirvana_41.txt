[Intro]
"Moderate Rock"
[Verse 1]
Mayday, every day, mayday!
Could've had a heart attack, my heart!
We don't know anything, my heart!
We all want something fair, my heart!
[Chorus]
Hey
Hey
Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Verse 2]
Out of town, out of sight, is my heart!
Queen of lies, not today, my heart!
One more on the phone, my heart!
One more at the door of my heart!
[Chorus]
Hey
Hey
Hey!
[Outro]
Mean heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
