[Verse 1]
I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
[Chorus]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
[Verse 2]
My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
[Chorus]
And I have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
[Bridge]
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up
[Verse 3]
I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
[Chorus]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
[Outro with Dave Grohl]
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
[Verse 1]
I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
[Chorus]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
[Verse 2]
My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
[Chorus]
And I have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
[Bridge]
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up
[Verse 3]
I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
[Chorus]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
[Outro with Dave Grohl]
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
