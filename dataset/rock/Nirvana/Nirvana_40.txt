[Verse 1]
I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice
[Verse 2]
If you ever need anything, please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy actin' like I'm not na誰ve
I've seen it all, I was here first
[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt
[Verse 2]
If you ever need anything, please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy actin' like I'm not na誰ve
I've seen it all, I was here first
[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the ground
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt
[Verse 1]
I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice
[Verse 2]
If you ever need anything, please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy actin' like I'm not na誰ve
I've seen it all, I was here first
[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt
[Verse 2]
If you ever need anything, please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy actin' like I'm not na誰ve
I've seen it all, I was here first
[Chorus]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the ground
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt
