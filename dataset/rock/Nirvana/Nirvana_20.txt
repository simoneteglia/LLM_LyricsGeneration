[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched 'til I bled
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do? (
Ooh, ooh
)
[Chorus]
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I can't complain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
[Verse 2]
My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do? (
Ooh, ooh
)
[Chorus]
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I can't complain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
[Bridge]
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I tryin' to say?
[Verse 3]
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
One more special message to go
And then I'm done, and I can go home
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do? (
Ooh, ooh
)
[Chorus]
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I can't complain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I can't complain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I can't complain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I'm on a plain (
Ooh, ooh
)
I can't complain (
Ooh, ooh
)
(I'm on a plain)
Ooh, ooh
(I can't complain)
Ooh, ooh
