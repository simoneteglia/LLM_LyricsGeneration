[Verse 1]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you
Yeah we got nothing to lose
[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you
[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms
[Verse 2]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far
[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you
[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms
[Half Chorus]
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
[Verse 1]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do
Now the room is all hazy
We're too lost in the fumes
I feel like it's just me and you
Yeah we got nothing to lose
[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you
[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms
[Verse 2]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh
We both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change
We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far
[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so
I give in to you
[Chorus]
This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
But you're here in my arms
[Half Chorus]
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
Will you take me to nirvana?
I don't think this will last
Cause you're here in my arms
