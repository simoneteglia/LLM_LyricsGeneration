[Verse 1]
I was a seeking out for a funnel
Not only magnets but I could pry bar it shut
Gluing my manhood towards a manhole
Like Pepe LePew the scent
Hey, hey, a lightweight clutch
[Chorus]
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titillate
[Verse 2]
(Hydraulic push of) kitty ass button
Tweeking and flexing if the wind blows just right
Tacky and thumbs on polyester
High water jumpsuits and a raped ape
Woody has
pix-n-facts
[Chorus]
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate
[Verse 3]
I don't know why
I've got a joke too silly to say
Don't trust the foams
I got a dick, dick, hear my fucking hate!
[Chorus]
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate
[Verse 4]
Vinegar and water is gaining monthly
Fiberglass insulation disguised as cotton candy
Spawning down stream, El Rancho Ovulate
Feeding a cow hamburger raw
[Verse 5]
Peter brought me a tiki idol
Billy's sneer reminds me of someone
Homesick a bay aboard the Love Boat
Toni Tenille, Sonny Bono
Charo had a nice set of lungs
[Chorus]
I got my penis spayed
I got a little tail
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
[Bridge]
I gotta be around pussy
Don't let me fall
I got a heh-heh well you can't live
[Chorus]
I got my
titillate
spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate spayed
I got my titillate
[Verse 1]
I was a seeking out for a funnel

I got my titillate spayed
I got my titilate spayed
I got my titillate
