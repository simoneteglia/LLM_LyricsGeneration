[Intro: Butch Vig &
Dave Grohl
]
We're rolling
Are we or not?
[Verse 1]
One more day to complete my service
One more high to decay my nervous
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over
One more debt to complete my service
One more time here to fade my servant
One more day if I find a way; over
[Chorus]
She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul
[Post-Chorus]
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
[Verse 2]
One more day to complain my servant
One more doubt here to find a servant
One more time here if I find a way; it's over
Wondering how I'll maintain my cover
One more day here to save my lover
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over
[Chorus]
She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul
[Post-Chorus]
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
[Bridge]
Just you need, you read, you're a freak
Hmmm
And knew, you read, you flew
Ooo
Hmmm
[Verse 3]
One more day to complete my circuit
One more high here to find my nervous
Someday I'm gonna find a way; it's over
One more doubt here to claim my supper
I can have anything you want to
One more day if I find a way; it's over
[Chorus]
She seemed to read minds
And I know we run out of time
Breathe the way here with you
Dream the same on the dew
Breathe the same on her
Take a moan on a man
Breathe the shame onto you
Breathe the lie
[Post-Chorus]
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age
