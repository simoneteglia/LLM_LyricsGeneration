[Verse]
What's a season in a right, if you can't have anything?
What's the reason in a rhyme, if a plan means anything?
What's the meaning in a crime? It's a fan if anything
Where's the meaning in a line? It's a brand, it's a brand
How a culture comes again, it's a plan of yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway
They're only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans
They'll be fans, they'll be fans
They'll be fans
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly!
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways!
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways!
[Outro]
