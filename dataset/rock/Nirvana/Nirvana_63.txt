[Verse 1]
Even in his youth
Even in his youth
Even in his youth
He was nothing
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Going nowhere
Daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed
He was something
Disgrace the family name
Disgrace the family name
Family name, he was something
[Chorus]
He was born for your crew
I've got nothing left to prove
If I die before I wake
Hope I don't come back a slave
[Verse 2]
Even in his youth
Even in his youth
Even in his youth
He was nothing
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Going nowhere
Daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed
He was the same, he was nothing
Disgrace the family name
Disgrace the family name
Family name, going nowhere
[Chorus]
Leave this one, for your brew
I've got nothing left to prove
If I die before I wake
Hope I don't come back a slave
Aye– yeah!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Leave this one, for your brew
I've got nothing left to prove
If I die before I wake
Hope I don't come back again
I'm dying
[Outro]
Even in his youth
Even in his youth
Yeah, yeah
Even in his youth
Even in his youth
Yeah, yeah
Even in his youth
Yeah, yeah
Even in his youth
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

He was nothing
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Going nowhere
Daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed
He was something
Disgrace the family name
Disgrace the family name
Family name, he was something
[Chorus]
