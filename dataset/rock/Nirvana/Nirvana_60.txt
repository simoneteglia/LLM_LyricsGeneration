[Verse 1]
Pick me, pick me, yeah
Let a low long signal
At ease, at least, yeah
Everyone is hollow
Pick me, pick me, yeah
Everyone is waiting
Pick me, pick me, yeah
You can even pay them

Hey!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
Dive in me!
Dive! Dive! Dive!

Dive in me!
Dive in me!
Dive in me!
[Verse 2]
Kiss this, kiss that, yeah
Let a low long signal
At ease, at ease, yeah
You could be my hero
Pick me, pick me, yeah
Everyone is waiting
Hit me, hit me, yeah
I'm real good at hating
[Chorus]
Hey!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
