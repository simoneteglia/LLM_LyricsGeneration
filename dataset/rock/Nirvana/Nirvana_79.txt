[Verse 1]
Load up on drugs, kill your friends
It's fun to lose and to defend
She’s overjoyed and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word
[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello
[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
I'm a Cheeto, my libido
Yeah
[Verse 2]
I’m worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I'll be incest
Our little tribe has always been
And always will until the end
[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello
[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
I'm a Cheeto, my libido
[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
