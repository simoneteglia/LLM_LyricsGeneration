[Verse 1]
She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns
She should have...
[Chorus]
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
[Verse 2]
She should have made her mother proud
She should have stood out in the crowd
She should have had another chance
She should have fallen on her stance
She should have..
[Chorus]
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
[Bass Solo]
[Chorus]
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
[Verse 1]
She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns
She should have...
[Chorus]
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
[Verse 1]
She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns
She should have...
[Chorus]
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
[Verse 2]
She should have made her mother proud
She should have stood out in the crowd
She should have had another chance
She should have fallen on her stance
She should have..
[Chorus]
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
[Bass Solo]
[Chorus]
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
[Verse 1]
She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns
She should have...

Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son, she should have...
Been a son
