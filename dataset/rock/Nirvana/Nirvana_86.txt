[Instrumental break]
[Verse 1]
I'm going to Hollywood
They'll see that I'm so good
I won't care how I feel
And I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields
[Chorus]
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
[Verse 2]
I want to be a star
I'm going to have a car
And you'll have to admit
I'll be rich as shit
[Chorus]
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
[Chorus]
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
[Verse 3]
I would give you some
If you only would have treated me nice
You'll wish that you did
And you'll feel pretty stupid
[Chorus]
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
[Chorus]
I'll just sit and grin
The money will roll right in
[Instrumental break]
