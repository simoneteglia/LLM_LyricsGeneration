[Verse]
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feeling
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice sprinkled with emotion?
Invented at your birth
[Chorus]
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
Formulate infinity
Store it deep inside me
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse]
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feeling
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice sprinkled with emotion?
Invented at your birth
[Chorus]
I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
Formulate infinity
Store it deep inside me
(Formulate infinity, deep inside me)

If I had to lose a mile
