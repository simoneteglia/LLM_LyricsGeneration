[Intro]
Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite perfomer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh and here's a donation basket for one supply of Leadbelly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Leadbelly's estate wants to sell me Leadbelly's guitar for $500,000
Passing a basket
Yeah, I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me. He wouldn't do it
[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found
[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
(Shiver for me)
[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines the sun don't shine
I'd shiver... the whole night through
[Outro]
Thank you
