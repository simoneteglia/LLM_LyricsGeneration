[Verse]
And as the soft pretentious mountains
Glisten in the light of the trees
And the flowers sing in D minor
And the birds fly happily
We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you only break my heart
[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, I can beat it, masturbate it
[Refrain]
I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could
[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, I can beat it,
ejaculate it
[Refrain]
I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever would
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever
You wouldn't think it ever could
[Verse]
And as the soft pretentious mountains
Glisten in the light of the trees
And the flowers sing in D minor
And the birds fly happily
We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you only break my heart
[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, I can beat it, masturbate it
[Refrain]
I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could
[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can hold it
I can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it
I can cut it, I can taste it
I can spank it, I can beat it,
ejaculate it
[Refrain]
I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever would
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
I've been looking for day glow
Always hearing the same old
Sticky boredom with a book
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever
You wouldn't think it ever could
