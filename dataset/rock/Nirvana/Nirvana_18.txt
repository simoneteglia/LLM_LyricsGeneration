[Verse 1]
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
[Chorus 1]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
[Verse 2]
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally
[Chorus 2]
I'm so tired, I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids
[Chorus 1]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty
[Outro]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Ha, ha
Ha
[Verse 1]
