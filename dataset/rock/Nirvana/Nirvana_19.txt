[Verse 1]
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
And always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
[Verse 2]
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love himself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it'd come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know your rights, you know your rights
You know your rights
Hey
[Verse 1]
I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
And always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
[Verse 2]
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love himself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it'd come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
You know your rights, you know your rights
You know your rights
Hey
