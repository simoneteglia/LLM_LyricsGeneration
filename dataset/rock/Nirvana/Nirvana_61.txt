[Verse 1]
They live a lifestyle that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make a living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they would come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
[Chorus]
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart
[Verse]
They live a lifestyle that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make a living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they would come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battleground
She loves it more than she will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
[Chorus]
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
They live a lifestyle that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full

She loves it more than she will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
[Chorus]
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart
