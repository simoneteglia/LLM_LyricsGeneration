[Verse 1]
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill
[Chorus]
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
[Verse 2]
Broken heart and broken bones
Finger plaster cast and horse pills
One more quirky cliché phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
[Chorus]
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
[Spoken Bridge]
Words are broken lives
Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral
Which have been painted brown and attached to the skull by common wood screws
Can make a child look like a deer
[Chorus]
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
[Verse 1]
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill
[Chorus]
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
[Verse 1]
Running nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill
[Chorus]
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
[Verse 2]
Broken heart and broken bones
Finger plaster cast and horse pills
One more quirky cliché phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
[Chorus]
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
In the someday
What's the sum?
