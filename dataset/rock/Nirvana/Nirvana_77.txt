[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high
Why you always saying, "Let the good times roll"?
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut, bleeding through the soffit nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
[Chorus]
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through thе tension, right now
[Interlude]
This is only a distraction
[Verse 2]
Swing, batter up, let's play
Powеr until the target bleeds
This gun would never turn on me
So, Paul Meany, will you drop that beat
Why you always saying, "Let that shit go"?
Pennywise fashion on a sad skid row
A gentrified neighborhood of blood-soaked homes
Draw the lines a little further, now they're coming back to get you
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
[Chorus]
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
[Bridge]
Yo, I can't shine to save my life
But I'll feel through the dark without you
I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped into the light to blind you
[Chorus]
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through the tension, right now
[Outro]
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
[Chorus]
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through thе tension, right now

I can't hear you
I can't hear you
