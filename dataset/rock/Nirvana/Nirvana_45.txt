[Verse 1]
This is out of our reach, this is out of our reach
This is out of our reach, and it's grown
This is getting to be, this is getting to be
This is getting to be drone
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep, and
I'm stoned
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep, and I'm...
I'm...
[Chorus]
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
[Verse 2]
This is out of our range, this is out of our range
This is out of our range and it's crude
This is getting to be, this is getting to be
This is getting to be like drone
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned!
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm!
Aah!
[Chorus]
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more!
[Bridge]
Yeah!
Drone
Stoned
[Chorus]
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl
[Verse 1]
This is out of our reach, this is out of our reach
This is out of our reach, and it's grown
This is getting to be, this is getting to be
This is getting to be drone
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep, and
I'm stoned
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep, and I'm...
I'm...
[Chorus]
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
[Verse 2]
This is out of our range, this is out of our range
This is out of our range and it's crude
This is getting to be, this is getting to be
This is getting to be like drone
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned!
I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep
I'm a negative creep and I'm!
Aah!
[Chorus]
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more
