[Verse 1]
Bell on door clangs, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face
[Chorus]
I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
[Verse 2]
Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips
[Chorus]
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I sense others in the room
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered in Aunt Bee's muff
[Chorus]
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed
[Verse 1]
Bell on door clangs, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face
[Chorus]
I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
[Verse 2]
Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips
[Chorus]
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I sense others in the room
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered in Aunt Bee's muff
[Chorus]
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed
