[Refrain]
Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Towards anti-social
So low, so low
[Pre-Chorus]
Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday, mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them
[Chorus]
Dimension seven
[Refrain]
Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Towards anti-social
So dumb, so dumb
[Pre-Chorus]
Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday, mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them
[Chorus]
Dimension seven
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
Straight as an arrow
