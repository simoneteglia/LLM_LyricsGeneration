[Verse 1]
Portray sincerity
Act out of loyalty
Defend your free country
Wish away, pain
Hand out lobotomies
To save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland, boring, plain!
[Pre-Chorus]
Holy now is restitution
Living out your date of fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty, master writing
[Chorus]
Somebody said that they're not much like I am, I know I can
Make enough of the words
You go along and I sing your song
[Verse 2]
Sickening pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God for putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!
[Pre-Chorus]
Holy now is restitution
Living out your date of fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty, master writing
[Chorus]
Somebody said that they're not much like I am, I know I can
Make enough of the words
You go along and I sing your song
Downer
