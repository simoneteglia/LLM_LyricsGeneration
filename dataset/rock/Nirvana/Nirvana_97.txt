[Verse 1]
Look your legs are ashes
Charred into a special
Don't make noise you'll break
Your legs, your eyes and all
You're right
[Break]
[Verse 2]
I was your accomplice
Man just read the furies
Special time but you can't
Make too much of him

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I was yours and closer
You were them in New York
Got me in to entertain
Your legs are in your legs
[Break]
[Verse 4]
I was your end dancer
More than all I wish you
Got me under with the
Nice, nice, nice religious pain
[Verse 1]
Look your legs are ashes
Charred into a special
Don't make noise you'll break
Your legs, your eyes and all
You're right
[Break]
[Verse 2]
I was your accomplice
Man just read the furies
Special time but you can't
