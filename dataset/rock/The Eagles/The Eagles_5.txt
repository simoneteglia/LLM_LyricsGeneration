[Intro]
6 Kiss
[Hook]
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
So free, so high
Oh my, I am so high (Yes)
I am the sky, alright
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
I'm so free, so high
Oh my, I am so high
I am the sky, alright
[Verse 1]
I smoke weed in the strangest places
Shout out to Lil' Wayne with the 'mazing graces
Philly blunts broken down in that candy painted
Foreign ride, windows up for that tree containment
Feel like I'm in the wind when I'm purple kushin'
Get it straight from the saints like I'm Reggie Bush'in
I don't think you really know what was in that kush
Until you put your nose and you smell that mution
Under arm kush, leave you where your hands is restin'
Break it down like a link on a chain reaction
And every time I buy one, it's just so relaxing
When you smoke a good blunt and get the same reaction
When I used to put the lean in the microwave
The Swisher smellin' like peaches with a pinch of raisins
Sunny days, good days when I'm purple trainin'
Wiz Khalifa know about it, but it gets me blazing
Purple trees
[Hook]
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
(Shouts out, my nigga, I see you)
So free, so high
Oh my, I am so high (Yes)
I am the sky, alright
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
I'm so free, so high
Oh my, I am so high (Shouts out)
I am the sky, alright
[Verse 2]
[?] when I touch down you got me
Rollin' blunts in my hand, how I be so sloppy?
Every morning, wake n' bake like it's Hell on Earth
And then I go to the room where I be so cocky
Like I smoke the best weed, why police ain't stop me?
'Cause I can't move the smell, it's just on my body
Fire blunts in the day my reception's cloudy
Plus the weed that I smoke represents my salary
I'm ballin', I'm ballin', Jim Jones copy
Catch me shootin' three-points and my aim ain't sloppy
Model girls blowin' down both ways, ya heard?
This for my nerve and I smoke to release my words
It ain't another one thang, as the streets observe
Except the purple grapes, some call it buds and herb
Plus a lot of dudes in college seem to know the words
Pass the bong, I'm finna smoke with the nerves
I'm in the sky, bitch
[Hook]
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
I'm so free, so high
Oh my, I am so high (Yes)
I am the sky, alright
(Shouts out to all my real smokers [?])
Light a blunt and we can spark this drough
(Smokin' since high school, know what I mean?)
With the weed in my hand, let the eagles go
(Smokin' since middle school, you know what I mean?)
I'm so free, so high
Oh my, I am so high
I am the sky, alright
[Outro]
Smokin' trees since middle school
Boil off half of our brain, nigga, to the muhfuckin grapes, nigga
Still ballin', nigga
Smoke the best weed, shouts out to Keyboard Kid
Let the eagles go
I'm so free, so high
Oh my, I am so high
I am the sky, alright (Yes)
