Lofty and impervious
Amongst thunderbolts and peerless stars
Born to predation, supremacy
To rule arid barren climes
Descend upon the realm of rodents
Fearsome and imperious
Claws lusting for their throats
Hating their every breath
Bone strewn escarpments and sanguine stygian depths
He must have wings who loves the abyss
Talons that grasp firm their prey
The hunger to rend their flesh
Take delight in the slaughter of the enemy
And the hunters solitary sternness
Soaring above in storm studded skies
Mocking those consumed by the depths
Amid cragged cliffs, and cruel rugged rocks
Autonomous and alone
