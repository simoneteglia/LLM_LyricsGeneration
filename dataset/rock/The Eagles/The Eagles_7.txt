I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come
I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket, yo
Y'see it started way back in NYC
When I stole my first rhyme from the M.I.C
At a west end avenue at 63
The beginning of a leap year, February, '96
With a guitar picked up in the mix
I committed to the licks like a nickel back of tricks
Well look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, now, now, now
I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come
I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket, yo
Well you're never gonna guess
Where I've been been been
And I have no regrets
That I bet my whole checking account
Because it all amounts to nothing up in the end
Well you can only count on the road again
We'll soon be on the radio dial
And I been payin' close attention to the Willie Nelson style
Like a band of gypsies on the highway while
I'm one man wishin' on the California skyline
Drive up the coast I brag and I boast
'Cuz I'm pickin' up my pace and makin' time like space ghost
Raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most
Put my cruise control on coast
'Cuz I'm tourin' around the nation on extended vacation see
I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation
I say, "I like your style, crazy pound pup
You need a ride?
Well come on, girl, hop in the truck!"
I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come
I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket, yo
I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come on
I'm just a curbside prophet
With my hand in my pocket
And I'm waiting for my rocket, yo
See I'm a down home brother, redneck undercover
With my guitar here, I'm ready to play
And I'm s a sucker for a filly
Got a natural ability to give the freestyle
Look at my flexibility
Dangerous at the mike, my ghetto hat's cocked right
The ladies say, "Yo, that kid is crazy"
We got the backstage Betties taking more than they can get
They say, "What's up with M R A Z?"
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey something's different in my world today
Well they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow
Hey, hey something's different in my world today
Well they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow
I'm just a curbside prophet
Curbside prophet now
Curbside prophet now
Curbside, come on
Just curbside prophet
Waiting for my rocket to, waiting for my rocket to come
Now curbside home now brother
You're a curbside
Waiting for my rocket to
