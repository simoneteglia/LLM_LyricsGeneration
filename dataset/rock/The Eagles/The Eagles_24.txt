You can say that I'm one curly fry
In the box of the regular
Messing with the flavor
Oh, the flavor that you savor
Saving me for last
But you better not eat me at all
Living in a fast food bag
Making friends with the ketchup and salt
People say that I'm crazy
For not moving on to better things
Instead I'm sitting around trash
Talking with the onion rings
But it's much too soon
To leave this easy life
Pass me the spoon
Pass the analytical knife
'Cause you're about to get cut and get cut down
It's all about the wordplay
All about the sound in the tone of my voice
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold
Better shut up or get shot down
It's all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play now
Too much food on my plate
Well believe it or not I super sized
My sights on the surprise in the cereal box
My stomachs smaller than my eyes
So I went to see the doctor
And he said
"Turn your head and then cough"
I didn't listen to what he said
Instead I couldn't wait to get off
He said, I can have this
But I can't have that
That I should keep wishing
I was living the life of a cat because
I ain't the one
Whose gonna be missing the feast
Just like you ain't the one
Who seems to be calming the beast
Now you're about to get cut and get cut down
It's all about the wordplay
All about the sound in the tone of my voice
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold
You better shut up or get shot down
It's all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play
You put too much food on my plate
Well, if you are what you eat in my case
I'll be sweet so come
And get some, I'm so over it
You're about to get cut and get cut down
It's all about the know how all just a matter of taste
Stop telling me the way I gotta play
You put too much food on my plate
Come on, get up to get get it and get down
Get up to get get it and get down
Get up to get get it enough and come up
Get up, get up, get up, come on
Get up to get get it and get some
Get up to get get it and get some
Get up to get get it and get some
There's too much food on my plate, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
