[Verse 1: Halle &
Chloe
]
You just flew out of your nest
(
You just flew out of your nest
)
Starting a brand new quest
(
Starting a brand new quest
)
But the world is trying to test
(
But the world is trying to test
)
And you feel alone and try to mold into the rest
(
And you feel alone tryin' to mold into the rest
)
[Chorus: Halle,
Chloe & Halle
]
Babybird
Grow some feathers, yeah yeah
Babybird
You can do better
[Verse 2: Chloe &
Halle
]
Mommy's not here no more
(
Mommy's not here no more
)
You're the only mouth you gotta feed for
(
Feed for
)
So sharpen up those claws
(
Sharpen up those claws
)
You gotta find your own voice
You gotta find your own (
You gotta find your own
)
[Chorus: Halle,
Chloe & Halle
]
Babybird
Grow some feathers, yeah yeah
[Bridge: Chloe,
Chloe & Halle
]
Why fly with the chickens
When you can fly with the eagles soarin'?
And the eagles big, but now
Why fly with the ground when you can fly with clouds?
(
Du-du-du-du-du-du-du
)
Why fly with the chickens
When you can fly with the eagles soarin'?
And the eagles big, but now
Why fly with the ground when you can fly with clouds?
[Chorus: Halle,
Chloe & Halle
]
Babybird (
Babybird
)
You can do better
Babybird (
Babybird, babybird, babybird
)
