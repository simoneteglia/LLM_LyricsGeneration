[Verse 1]
We played "Heads Up" in a car in Seattle
God rock on the radio
You look like a superstar and Dom got into Juilliard
And I'm really bad at "Heads Up," what do you know?
My drummer fell for a girl in a cookie shop
He said he'd make a move and then he went with, "Excuse me?"
Came a boy and left a man, gotta give it to the band
Greatest one in Oregon (Oregon)
[Pre-Chorus]
And lookin' back, all I know is
[Chorus]
It was Friday nights, it was video gold
Oh, it was shinin' lights, it was rock 'n' roll
It was the band and I on a twelve-bed bus
And it was makin' and messin' it up
It was endless roads in the same old boots
Oh, it was letting go of everything but you
It was the band and I on a twelve-bed bus
If we're livin' the dream, I hope we never wake up
[Verse 2]
Snowstorm in the middle of Texas
Called my mother in a Denny's and lied
Told her I'd been eating, then told her you were just a friend
Told her I was homesick, I hadn't thought of home twice
[Pre-Chorus]
Drive and then we drive again to an ocean
And I think I knew it then for a moment
[Chorus]
It was Friday nights, it was video gold
Oh, it was shinin' lights, it was rock 'n' roll
It was the band and I on a twelve-bed bus
And it was makin' and messin' it up
It was endless roads in the same old boots
Oh, it was letting go of everything but you
It was the band and I on a twelve-bed bus
If we're livin' the dream, I hope we never wake up
[Post-Chorus]
I hope we never wake up
I hope we never wake up
I hope we never wake
[Bridge]
Two nights in the El Rey went flying
I'm twenty-one
and I feel evergreen
The band go home, I stay to write, we drive around, I stay the night
Guys, I'm pretty sure it's the American dream
[Chorus]
It was changin' clocks, it was Tina stoned
Oh, it was midnight stops at border control
Yeah, it was power cuts, it was certain doom
It was livin' in the Little Rock laundry room
Oh, it was breaking down, it was fallin' in love
In a gas station by the pickup trucks
In Philadelphia, it was crystal clear
We are the best damn band that's ever played right here
It was magic, babe, pure and strong
It was the last man
standin' for the Eagles song
It was a far-flung wish when we were young
Now, we're livin' the dream and I hope we never wake up
