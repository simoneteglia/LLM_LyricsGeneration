[Intro]
TreOnTheBeat, yeah
[Chorus]
None of these peons is fuckin' with me
I got no label, bitch, all of this me
Fuck your opinion, I do not agree
You want a feature, I'm charging a fee
All of my mills are droppin' organic
All of these labels is startin' to panic
DDG poppin' and making some damage
I quoted 5 million at Atlantic
None of these peons is fuckin' with me
I got no label, bitch, all of this me
Fuck your opinion, I do not agree
You want a feature, I'm charging a fee
All of my mills are droppin' organic
All of these labels is startin' to panic
DDG poppin' and making some damage
I quoted 5 million at Atlantic
[Verse 1]
Too many niggas is all in my ear
Bitch I got poppin' in less than a year
I shop at Gucci you shopping at Sears
I'm making more money than my peers
These niggas hatin' on me and I know it
They pull up talkin', ain't never gon' show it
I make a hunnid bands and I blow it
Fucking on mommies, that's cuter than Louis
I dropped out of college and moved to LA
Picked up 40 racks and got me a place
Stacked a hunnid racks and bought a i8
Next purchase is a house and wraith
Boss nigga and I ain't even legal
Still ballin' like I play for the Eagles
Strip club threw a thousand in singles
Don't compare us nigga, we are not equal
[Bridge]
You girl just text me she love me, uh
Send dirty text want to fuck me, uh
She tell me that you a dummy, uh
She said my man broke and bummy, uh
Your girl not satisfied, uh
I'ma dick her down right, uh
She text me she stay the night, uh
She cheat on you with my pipe, uh
[Verse 2]
They don't want life to go my way
Pockets lookin' like they overweight
Big money, I collect my pay
All these niggas finna know my face
Dippin' dabbin' to my checking account
Big number, you can't even pronounce
Screenshot couldn't show the amount
1,2,4... I can't even count
But enough about the money though
I don't know, you do not call me "bro"
Heard you used to fuck with so and so
Promise you I do not know the ho
I cannot ever ever take this for granted
No label but, I got the advantage
Niggas hatin' and I really can't stand it
Muy bien how I'm doing, in Spanish
[Chorus]
None of these peons is fuckin' with me
I got no label, bitch, all of this me
Fuck your opinion, I do not agree
You want a feature, I'm charging a fee
All of my mills are droppin' organic
All of these labels is startin' to panic
DDG poppin' and making some damage
I quoted 5 million at Atlantic
None of these peons is fuckin' with me
I got no label, bitch, all of this me
Fuck your opinion, I do not agree
You want a feature, I'm charging a fee
All of my mills are droppin' organic
All of these labels is startin' to panic
DDG poppin' and making some damage
I quoted 5 million at Atlantic
