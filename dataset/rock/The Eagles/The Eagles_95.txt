[Verse 1]
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking, run free
Run free and wild, lose your mind, escape your inhibitions
Taste the wind, let your hair down, throw your hands up
Go, go, go, let go, forget the consequences
Go, go, go, let go, running free
[Chorus]
Open your heart, open your mind
To a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly
To a new world, to a new world
[Verse 2]
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking, run free
Run free and wild, lose your mind, this world's yours for the taking
Open wide, scream it loud: "this is my life"
Go, go, go, let go, forget what came before
Go, go, go, let go, running free
[Chorus]
Open your heart, open your mind
To a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly
To a new world, to a new world
[Bridge]
Close your eyes and pray for something bigger than this world has to give
Make it worth your time when you move on to whatever the hell's next
Know that you went in the end without a single regret
That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and followed your dreams
[Outro]
You won't; you won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid, yeah!
You won't; you won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
Run free and wild
Let your heart soar with the eagles
Run free and wild
Let your love take over
You won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
