The night, she brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow
Clouds soothe and shredded by the calico
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now
And this time like every other time I believe that I never find
Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky
And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again
Not again, not again, not again
And don't it feel alright, and don't it feel so nice
Lovely, lovely, lovely say, say it again
Lovely, say it again
Well, I'm unable to inhale all the riches
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points
As I'm all by myself tonight not again, not again
And don't it feel alright, and don't it feel so nice
Lovely, lovely, lovely say, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
And if you should nervously break down
When it's time for the shakedown would you take it
It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle
That you've made it
And don't it feel alright, and don't it feel so nice
Love, love, love, lovely, lovely, lovely
Love, love, love, love, lovely, lovely
Say it, say it, say it again love, love, love, love
So lovely, lovely to do it again, it's so lovely to do it again, again
Oh, loving again, it's comin' again, it's comin' again
Love, love, oh love, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, love, love, love, love
Lovely, say it, say it, say it again, so beautiful, so nice
It's comin' again, lovely
Lovely
Lovely
