[Chorus]
I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the
Eagle's
flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite
[Verse 1]
Did we fly to the Moon too soon?
Did we squander the chance?
In the rush of the race
The reason we chase is lost in romance
And still we try
To justify the waste
For a taste of man's greatest adventure, woah
[Chorus]
I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the
Eagle's
flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite
[Verse 2]
Have we lost what it takes to advance?
Have we peaked too soon?
If the world is so green
Then why does it scream under a blue moon?
We wonder why
If the Earth's sacrificed
For the price of it's greatest treasure, woah
[Chorus]
I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the
Eagle's
flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite (Satellite, satellite, satellite)
[Interlude]
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
(La-la-la-la-la)
[Verse 3]
And when we shoot for stars
What a giant step
Have we got what it takes
To carry the weight of this concept?
Or pass it by like a shot in the dark
Miss the mark with a sense of adventure, woah
[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Don't blame this sleeping satellite
[Chorus]
I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the
Eagle's
flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite
[Outro]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Don't blame this sleeping satellite
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Don't blame this sleeping satellite
