You, you were a friend, you were a friend of mine
I let you spend the night you see how it was my fault
Of course it was mine
I'm too hard at work have you ever heard of anything
So absurd ever in your life, I'm sorry for wasting your time
Who am I to say this situation isn't great?
When it's my job to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me
Not that easy
Hey what's that you say?
You're not blaming me for anything that's great
But I don't break that easy, does it fade away?
So that's why I'm apologizing now for telling you
I thought that we could make it
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed
So who am I to say this situation isn't great?
It's my time to make the most of it
Of course I didn't know that this would happen to me
Not that easy, no, no, no, no
All along the fault is up for grabs why can't you have it
If it's for sale what is your offer
I'll sell it for no less than what I bought it for
Pay no more than absolutely zero
Well neither one of us deserves the blame
Because opportunities moved us away
And it's not an easy thing to learn to play a game
That's made for two that's you and me
The rules remain a mystery, see it was so easy
So who am I to say this situation isn't great?
It's our time to make the most of it
How could we ever know that this would happen to me
Not that easy, no, no, oh
All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it
Well it's for sale go make your offer
Well I sell it for no less than what I bought it for
Pay no more than absolutely zero, no, no
