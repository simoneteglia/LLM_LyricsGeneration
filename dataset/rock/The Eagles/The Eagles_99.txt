[Verse 1: POETIK]
Well, if I talk about the six-eight-lima
I'ma swerve Hamo-style while
sippin' on that Vailima
Swig life Apia, it's the state as you click
Ran in all around the world tre times and kept it lit
I could joust with the best of 'em, say word
Poly girls slim thick, make the kitty cat purr
I wouldn't change it at all
Stay G, duckin' laws
And it's done for the culture, never for the applause
Fa'a Samoa, baby
Who could rock the mic so precise, then take it right back to Samoa, baby?
Old school, Penina O Tiafau, straight classic
Vital Status still doin' damage
Mansion in Tutuila up in the mix
84-85 better sound like this
From the Bay to LA, back to AKL
You know the uso quite well
[Chorus: Victor J Sefo and
BIGGs 685
]
685 on your spеakers (Speaker)
685 on your radio (Oh yеah)
685, we'll be rollin' (Rollin')
685, we patrollin' (Patrollin')
Six-eighty-five around the world (One hunnid)
Selau pesene Samoan (Woo)
685 around the world, yeah (
Uh huh, check it
) (Let it be)
Uso, let it be known (
Uh
) (Uso)
Uso, let it be kn-
[Verse 2: BIGGs 685]
Saleleloga, Vailima poured deep in the veins
Bloodline before my city, you can put in on gang
I'm a 685er, Sydney westsider
Uso called BIGGs, South Pacific we die for [?]
Call it the Uce way
Like the Eagles, live life in the fast lane
I was stuck up in the mud, now I'm good, mane
685 blew the game off like propane
Wop, wop, with the track, hit your trunk, yup
Capitani Mokeni in my cupboard
Vailima on ice, ball bats full of herb
Bringin' that noise, kama mamafa, say the word
Back to the business, hustle stay relentless
Fa'a Samoa, God and family providin'
Talkin' this robbin', out here survivin'
Ethic unmatched, somethin' learned from the islands, baby
[Chorus: Victor J Sefo]
685 on your speakers (Speaker)
685 on your radio (Oh yeah)
685, we'll be rollin' (Rollin')
685, we patrollin' (Patrollin')
Six-eighty-five around the world (One hunnid)
Selau pesene Samoan (Woo)
685 around the world, yeah (Let it be)
Uso, let it be known (Uso)
685 on your speakers (Speaker)
685 on your radio (Oh yeah)
685, we'll be rollin' (Rollin')
685, we patrollin' (Patrollin')
Six-eighty-five around the world (One hunnid)
Selau pesene Samoan (Woo)
685 around the world, yeah (Let it be)
Uso, let it be known (Uso)
Uso, let it be known
[Outro: Victor J Sefo]
685 on your speakers (Speaker)
685 on your radio (Oh yeah)
685, we'll be rollin' (Rollin')
685, we patrollin' (We trollin')
Six-eighty-five around the world (One hunnid)
685 around the world, yeah (Let it be)
Uso, let it be known (Uso)
Uso, let it be known
