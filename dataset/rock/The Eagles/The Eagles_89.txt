[Intro]
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly, fly
If you truly want to see the world for what it really is, you have to get above it. You have to get above it, you must fly like the eagles, fly beyond the eagles, fly above the eagles to see how the world really is
[Chorus]
Yeah skk
Contemplate how we're gonna make it through the night
I'm weak and I ain't gotta fake it in my life
Oh, Lord, You know we need You
Since you, gave me power for my people
Now send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Now send me way up (way up, way up)
Now send me way up (way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles
I gotta go fly away, I gotta go fly away
I gotta go fly away, I gotta go fly away
Send me way above the eagles
Now send me way up
Now send me way up
Send me way above the eagles
[Verse 1]
I'm an overcomer, reaching high above 'em
I'm like Danny Glover shootin' high above 'em
Come through doot doot doot doot, snapping all up on em
It's a lethal weapon, that's a dragon on me
I'm just here to fly above the stat quo
I don't pledge allegiance to the mass, no
If your freedom in God let your flag show
Man I've been reaching forward, let the past go
Going back? No!
How could they tell us to stand for something when they want us to play the victim
It's a broken system, we can't make a living
If the money in our pockets got their hands up in them
Wasn't planned for us to win this
It wasn't in the plan to finish
Put them in hella ghettos, man I get it
Them pies they selling weren't meant for purchase from a people group
Oh now I get it!
If you really want to get above the average, you better get to reading that's real talk
And your mind is conditioned to take with they'd give you, don't question what's been taught
Why you think Frederick Douglass was dressed up like dang it he's real smart?
I'm breaking them chains of ignorance, tryna to stop em, I get real heart
I'm light in the real dark
You've been shot by the devil, he's clever, a real shark
He playin' with a real part
Ain't no sleepin', only weeping for you so stand guard
Weapon it can charge
The word is all I got, no jamming,  it rams hard
With allegiance we stand large
With a shot so big it ain't nothing you can guard
[Chorus]
Contemplate how we're gonna make it through the night
I'm weak and I ain't gotta fake it in my life
Oh Lord You know we need You
Since you, gave me power for my people
Now send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Now send me way up (way up, way up)
Now send me way up (way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles
I gotta go fly away, I gotta go fly away
I gotta go fly away, I gotta go fly away
Send me way above the eagles
Now send me way up
Now send me way up
Send me way above the eagles
[Verse 2]
I do this, one time for my squinad
Two times for my hittas
I grind hard on my jinob
Ain't got time for no quitters
Ain't in this cause it sounds good
I've been in this since my childhood
I'm just doing what the wild should
Fit in my position just like the crown would
Been with lions in the jungle
Skip the running we can rumble
Feel the weight or feel the muscle
Don't fix the systematic struggles
This oppression gotta crumble up
No discussion when that chopper chopping like an AK47
Chuck it, ain't no Smith and Wesson
Just the old and new, the testimony
Got me walking like a holy matrimony
Yeah I put up what they put up on me
Ooh I'm confident, you see the strap up on me
Back up back up homie
Back up, ain't no stressing while we counting blessings
We just riding with the homies, uh
I been riding like an eagle, feeling unbelievable
I got the juice when I come to this
I got the power like I'm Superman
Energy from the sun, I'm King Kong, you a son to me
And that's what I told life
Depression the pain and the struggle to fight
Focused again and gained life
I'm only stronger when I'm standing up righteous
[Chorus]
Contemplate how we're gonna make it through the night
Now send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Send me way above the eagles (way up, way up, way up, way up)
I gotta go fly away, I gotta go fly away
I gotta go fly away, I gotta go fly away
Send me way above the eagles
Now send me way up
Now send me way up
Send me way above the eagles
