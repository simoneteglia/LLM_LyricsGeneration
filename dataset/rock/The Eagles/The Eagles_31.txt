[Verse 1]
Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy
[Pre-Chorus]
The remеdy is the experiеnce
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
[Chorus]
No, no, I won't, I won't worry my life away
I, I won't worry my life away
[Verse 2]
Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me, 'cause if you've gots the poison and baby I'm your remedy
[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how, oh you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
'Cause it all amounts to nothing in the end
[Chorus]
Oh, no, I won't, I won't worry my life away
Not today
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
[Bridge]
When I fall in love now, I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still gonna shine
And I'll tell you why
[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is always the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
'Cause it all amounts to nothing in the end
[Chorus]
Oh no, I won't, I won't worry my life away
Not today
I, I won't worry my life away
Not today
I won't worry my life away
