[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go;
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow
[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia,
Bob Weir
]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, burns my eyes to see;
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me
[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all
[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne
,
from sea to shining sea
[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia,
Bob Weir
]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
There ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run
[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much
Too slow
[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
