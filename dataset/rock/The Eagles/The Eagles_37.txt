[Verse 1]
Time shall wait for no man
You know when it's time to decide
Trying as hard as you can
Defying the turn of the tide
[Pre-Chorus]
Like thunder, like a storm
A battlecry heard in the distance
Rebellion takes form
Deliverance!
[Verse 2]
Do you wish to be king? (To be king?)
With triumph upon crimson steel
Unleash your will to win (Will to win)
And then to no man you shall kneel
[Pre-Chorus]
Like thunder, like a storm
A battlecry heard in the distance
Rebellion takes form
Deliverance!
No second chance!!!
[Chorus]
High atop the mountain
Where the eagles fly
Destiny stands in wait for the ones who try
Drink from the fountain that never runs dry, oh!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Deliverance!
No second chance!!!
[Chorus]
High atop the mountain
Where the eagles fly
Destiny stands in wait for the ones who try!!!
(High atop the mountain)
Where the eagles fly
(Where the eagles fly!)
Destiny stands in wait for the ones who try
Drink from the fountain that never runs dry
Oh, yeah!
