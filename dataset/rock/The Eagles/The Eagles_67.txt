[Verse 1: Chad Kroeger]
I am so high, I can hear heaven
I am so high, I can hear heaven
Whoa, but heaven, no, heaven don't hear me
[Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott]
And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
[Verse 2: Josey Scott,
Chad Kroeger
]
Someone told me love would all save us
But how can that be? Look what love gave us
A world full of killing and blood spilling
That world never came
[Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott]
And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
(Ah-ah)
[Bridge: Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott]
Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do
[Chorus: Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott]
And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away
[Outro: Chad Kroeger, (Josey Scott),
Both
]
And they're watching us (Watching us)
They're watching us (Watching us)
As we all fly away
And they're watching us (Watching us)
They're watching us (Watching us)
As we all fly away, yeah (Hey, yeah, yeah)
And they're watching us (Watching us)
They're watching us (Watching us)
As we all fly away, yeah, yeah
Whoa
