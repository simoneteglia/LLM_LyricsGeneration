Behind the Eagles Lodge we were hiding
Friday night while everyone
Was in the bar drinking
For ten minutes we went missing
I kissed your face underneath the broken awning
Please let’s just go
Please let's go before it’s too late
Why oh why do I get so scared I think I’m dying?
All I want to do is drown with you
While they’re all watching
The ships in the river they’re all passing
They’ll take us away
Like misfit cargo they’ll let stay
But please go, I hear his voice so go
They’re all coming out to smoke
