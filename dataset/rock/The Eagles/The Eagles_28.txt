[Verse 1: MK Asante]
They don’t like us but we don’t care
Whoever tries to fight us, we don’t spare
Crack down our Liberty Bell that needs repair
Like the wings of justice need some fresh air
We the people, We the Eagles
See us equal, Super Bowl need a sequel
Fly Eagles landing right on they needle
Trying to convert sea hawks into sea gulls
Easeley, Lynch, Largent, Boom
Cunningham, Reggie, Dawkins—Wooooo
NFL Tussle, all will, all muscle
All skill, all hustle, all-pro, all Russеll
Come take a ride down I 9-5
Bang a U on Broad Street thеn hit Linc Drive
No fear in the city, you can feel it in our vibe
Home of the deck of indy, intergrity in our lines
20-20  2-1-5, we see through your facades
This Philly, we learn to get even by beating odds
Home team of the Rocky and Creed themes
Dream-chasers who breed steam and bleed green
Current condition, we excel on the nemesis
The bell of freedom goin off despite blemishes
4th and inches, Monday Night finishes
Pull up to Philly to see who the real winner is
