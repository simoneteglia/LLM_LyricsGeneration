Would it take a bakers dozen to get my point to you?
Or would it take a half a pound to roll a joint for you?
Or would it take some hailing Mary's
So full of grace to get my sound to you?
Will you help me break it down and get on through?
Now to the other side, it's easy if you only try, try, try, try
We don't lie down on the job oh yeah
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, no
Ain't no stopping us
Should I address all my letters to the well to be?
Or should I say return to sender is just a well be done?
Or should I better not take it so personally
If all the good loving is never received?
Baby if it was me well I wouldn't think twice
No not I, I, I, I, I, I, its easy if you only try, try, try
We don't lie down well on the job or worse it
Because once we hit the top there's no stopping us, no
There is no stopping us, there is no stopping us no, no stopping us
Ooh I will drive a thousand miles or I'll meet you at the station
If only you would take a vacation from this thing you have created
I promise to make it worth your while
You know, you know that I'll try
So come on try try and baby baby won't you try
It's easy if you do not run
Well I promise you you'll have your fun fun
Because once we hit the top we've just begun
Ooh, there's no stopping us
There is no stopping us yeah, there is no stopping us
