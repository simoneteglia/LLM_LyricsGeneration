I've been travelin over mountains
Even through the valleys too
I've been travelin night and day
I've been runnin all the way
Baby, tryin' to get to you
(Baby, tryin' to get to you)
Ever since I've read your letter
Where you said you love me true
I've been travelin' night and day
I've been runnin' all the way
Baby, tryin' to get to you
(Baby, tryin' to get to you)
When I've read your lovin' letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing
I just had to reach you baby
Despite of all that I've been through
I kept travelin' night and day
I kept runnin' all the way
Baby, tryin' to get to you
(Baby, tryin' to get to you)
If I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do
I'd would travel night and day
And I'd still run all the way
Baby, tryin' to get to you
(Baby, tryin' to get to you)
There was nothin' that could hold me
Or could keep me way from you
When your lovin' letter told me
That you really loved me true
(That you really loved me true)gh
Lord above he knows I love you
It was he who brought me through
When my way was black as night
He'd still shine me bright as light
When I was tryin' to get to you
