[Verse 1]
Never thought I'd be like this
Switch up every second
Can't stay in one direction
But that changed when we kissed
I saw sparks fly and I
I can't believe myself
I just can't see myself
With someone that's not you
[Pre-Chorus]
Holding on to this feeling
Promise I won't let go
[Chorus]
Lovin' this phase with you
Wanna run away with you
Be one with the birds and the eagles
Baby, just me and you
We can go back to your crib
Take a couple shots
Wine down, destress
Be one with the birds and the eagles
Baby, just mе and you
[Verse 2]
Can never make up my mind
I keep on tеlling myself that I'm doing just fine
No time and space to let someone in
But for you, I could keep up that confidence
Be more than friends
Be more than friends
Than friends
[Pre-Chorus]
Holding on to this feeling
I promise I won't let go
[Chorus]
Lovin' this phase with you
Wanna run away with you
Be one with the birds and the eagles
Baby, just me and you
We can go back to your crib
Take a couple shots
Wine down, destress
Be one with the birds and the eagles
Baby, just me and you
