[Verse 1: Jennifer Warner &
Joe Cocker
]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive
[Refrain: Joe Cocker]
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day
[Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow
[Verse 2: Joe Cocker &
Jennifer Warnes
]
Some hang on to "used to be"
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find
[Refrain]
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day
[Chorus]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow
[Bridge: Joe Cocker]
Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today
[Chorus:
Both
]
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Where the clear winds blow
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
