[Chorus: Young Adz]
I think I'm Albanian (Blrr), I'm a eagle
Posted on the corner sellin' coca like it's legal
Put it in her, and she, uh-uh, she said, "I need you"
Hello, mummy, oh my God, it's really nice to meet you
Got it for the foil and the pipe before the needle (Blrr)
Elegant, the sun is pepperin'
If she catch me cheatin', I won't never say, "I need you" (Mm, mm)
I'm not gonna sit and act like me and you are equal (Mmm)
[Verse 1: Young Adz]
Pour up (Pour up), p-p-pour up
When you talk to me, remember that I Birkin bag my daughter (Hold up)
Rolex too (Huh), VVS diamonds got the flu (Huh)
Opp block playin' peek-a-boo,
VVS my niеces too
Big backpack, blend in like a tourist whеn you see me in town (Town)
Glasses on, Janet Jackson servin' Bobby Brown (Brown)
Kidnap gang, do not say a word, don't make a sound (Sound)
Half a million for Wireless, I made my mummy proud
[Chorus: Young Adz]
I think I'm Albanian (Blrr), I'm a eagle
Posted on the corner sellin' coca like it's legal
Put it in her, and she, uh-uh, she said, "I need you"
Hello, mummy, oh my God, it's really nice to meet you
Got it for the foil and the pipe before the needle (Blrr)
Elegant, the sun is pepperin'
If she catch me cheatin', I won't never say, "I need you"
I'm not gonna sit and act like me and you are equal
[Verse 2: Dirtbike LB]
Beez (Yeah), hundred thou' on VV's (Yeah)
Miss my trap niggas, so fuck around and free B (Free my nigga)
I'm probably strapped, nigga, so they don't wanna see me (See me)
I'm back to back with it, Tec-9 and CZs (CZ)
So stack your money up high until the ceilin' (The ceilin')
I couldn't tell you no lies, I got no feelings (No feelings)
I copped the big body twice and put the Gs in (Yeah)
Two hundred thou' on those jets in summer, they know I'm eatin' (Word)
Louis V my size, put your ho in runners (Ho in runners)
Cartier eyesight, I'm wearin' gold all summer (Gold all summer)
I stayed and fuckin' provided for all my brothers' brothers
Cop the Porsche twice in different colours, colours
Ain't no apron, made half a M in a stadium (Yeah)
I used the bakin', in the kitchen cookin' Adin (Ross)
They think I'm hero status, I ain't tryna save them (Yeah)
This little nigga think I hate him, I'm the one that made him

[Verse 3: Noizy]
All my brothers gettin' money, fuckin' dummy
When we pull up, it ain't funny, fuckin' try me
Hip-hop-it ia rujmë stanin, si qen Sharri
Hajde, kqyrni nëse doni,
pika t'kuqe si nishani
Nuk jam gangster, I'm just chillin', they don't believe me
Nuk i preki, I'm just filmin', they don't see me
Lekë prej nafte, that's why we're drillin', s'di a dini
Kesh t'u hongër bukë n'Milano, nuk kom lidhje unë me krimin
Twenty-five, I made a killin', my first million
J
om t'u shty, po s'jom t'u fol për gym-in
, s'di a dini
I won't fuck her unless she drippin', cream whippin'
Get the suckin', get the spittin', eyes glitterin', no bitchin'
M'tha: "Hajd', t'i ndërrojna numrat edhe bona SRZ"
I thashë: "I ndërrojna ADN" dhe "KLM"
Nëse don me m'pa apet, i thashë: "Duhesh me m'mbajt sekret"
Kur unë iki, m'çon mesazh, "FLM"
Automati sikur aparti, vdekje çasti
Ndizen dritat sikur fishekzjarri, po nuk o party
Nuk bon punë mo as ilaçi, e as spitali
I'm Albanian, you're not supposed to like me
See, you can close the doors on me, but the eagles come from the sky, yeah, yeah
(But you can close the doors on me, but the eagles come from the sky, yeah, yeah)
