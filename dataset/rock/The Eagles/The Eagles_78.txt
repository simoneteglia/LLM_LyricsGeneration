[Intro]
Attero
Dominatus
Berlin is burning
Denique
Interimo
The Reich has fallen
[Verse 1]
We stand at the gates of Berlin
With two and a half million men
There's 6,000 tanks in our ranks
We'll use them as battering rams
Artillery leading the way
A million grenades has been launched
The Nazis must pay for their crimes
The wings of the eagle has been broken
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Marshall Zhukov'
s orders:
Serve me Berlin on a plate
Disregard the losses
The city is ours to take
[Chorus]
Attero Dominatus
Berlin is burning
Denique Interimo
The Reich has fallen
[Verse 2]
The price of a war must be paid
Millions of lives has been lost
The price must be paid by the men
That started the war in the thirties
The spring of the year '45
The year when the Nazis will fall
We're inside the gates of Berlin
The beak of the Eagle is broken
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Comrade Stalin
's orders:
Serve me his head on a plate
Disregard the losses
The Eagles' land is ours to take
[Chorus]
Attero Dominatus
Berlin is burning
Denique Interimo
The Reich has fallen
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
March!
Fight!
Die!
In Berlin!
March!
Fight!
Conquer
Berlin!
[Chorus]
Attero Dominatus
Berlin is burning
Denique Interimo
The Reich has fallen
[Chorus]
Attero Dominatus
Berlin is burning
Denique Interimo
The Reich has fallen
[Outro]
Attero
