This is the most unusual story of a most unusual girl
She's the paint in my picture of a most unusual world
She can crawl out a frame while she's hanging on the wall
And she's calling my name, she's not so usual
Oh no, she's not so usual
Oh, no
She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me
She complains when I smoke but then you do the same to me
She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go to sleep
She's gonna catch me when I'm falling hard
She's most unusual
Oh, no, she's not so usual
Oh, no, she's not so usual
Oh, no, she's not so usual
Oh, no
She's not so hooked on me drugs like I thought that she was
And never sucking on the lime and hardly sipping on the wine
And despite of her bipolar roller coastering
I think I can trust she'll keep me singing differently
And that's fine, 'cause she's with me now most all of the time
Trying and saving my life, thinking not of her own
And always kissing me goodnight when I just need to be alone
She's so sweet, so discreet, she's exactly what I need
Not even make believe
Oh oh, she's not so usual
She's not so u
Oh say, she's not so, not so usual
But you see not too practical neither, babe
I said, "She's not so, not so mystical, not too magical
Why? Because she say so"
Not so out of control and not so into the fold
Oh, she's not so usual
She's a natural
Oh, she's not so usual
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
She wants to do is so
She's not so u
Oh, she's not so u
Not so, no
