[Intro: K.A.A.N.]
Yeah
Knowledge
Lawd, eh
[Verse 1: K.A.A.N.]
Came with a couple of questions, I am suggesting the obvious
Make you ingest my vernacular, master of all my abilities
Acrobatic, back and forth, I'm like an
addict
Mr. "Go And Get It",
gift of gab, I got it
Un-combative been to battles
, won 'em all
Flow ridiculous, sentences running on
Now they all opposed, no one fucking with me
That's okay 'cause I like my seclusion
They soon to succumb to the sound we created
I catered to no one but me and mines
Ain't no fucking handouts that was ever given
This is repetition at its finest, baby
I don't give a damn if anybody like it
Boy, I said that I do this for me, let's make it clear
I'm a demonstrative lyricist, literally in the infancy stages
I stated my purpose before, but they forcing my hand with this ignorance
I'm in the sinning the sense that I'm coming with purer intentions
I'm tempted to just take the scenic route
Got to figure out how we gon' make it happen
Time is not on my side in the midst of madness
I been so lost on the road I travel
Given everything I wanted, I let my pain unravel
I'm a singer, to writer, I'm like a poet I guess
None less than an era that was legendary
I took a plan and I mapped it out
In terms of energy I feel like I'm maxing out
How many times can you fail 'fore you just submit
No one is convinced, I'm in, but I want to get out
And my doubting just consumed
I've been thinking, "What the hell I got to lose?"
A little bit of my pride, threw away food for thought
I'm getting rid of my ego as a way to progress
I want to humble myself, become meek and thankful
Just appreciate the talent that I was given
I want to maximize and to attain a lot
I send all praise to the most high, lawd!
[Hook: Don Henley]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
You can find it here"
[Verse 2: K.A.A.N.]
Gimme a little bit of peace, I don't ask for much
There's no comparison to me, I'm just a bastard, bruh
The way I'm mixing with the words, I make a massacre
You hear the pain in my rhymes, spectacular
But then you pass it up and then move on
My shit looked over like it's not a threat
It takes a lot of time, I want to get you convinced
But when I hit you with this shit, it makes opinions switch
I better get the recognition that I really deserve
The style is superb, the one that they rather defer
And I patiently oppose hipocracy but don't patronize me in the least
Unleash my words of wisdom when the verse is finished
Never ever change with my tone and temperament
I channel my wrath from out the Old Testament
I lost it all like King Solomon
But I be getting it back, I tell a vigorous tale
A visionary what I am, but nobody believes
I'm trying to keep it all together, but I might conceive
My mic check sound nice, one-two, I done it. Been doubted from the beginning, I swear that I is
I'll give a simple example, the way that music is handled
I make a mandatory margin, I'm walking my territory
I'ma tell it like it is, but from my perspective
I can't fabricate, I'ma put my truth on the page
I could care less if it's accepted
You done seen my growth from inception
Search for profession, I pray that we prosper
The problem for me is I just want my happiness
Hope that it happens through records
But I can't imagine that I'ma do this shit forever, lawd!

"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year
You can find it here"
[Verse 3: K.A.A.N.]
I need some time for myself, I stay away from the rest of them
I just don't trust anybody, emotionally I'm invested
Selfish, centered, part it, walk up on it, bent the path
I'm passing the negative point of view, I move in silence, said I soothe and save
I sanctify the vein, I rectify the pain
I paint a picture, pay attention
Want your help to spread the message, like the gospel
This apostle never puts the faults in the form of my faith
I cannot take it, so I fade away, but my fate was predetermined
Got the firm belief that what I leave is a legible legacy
Blessings that came from the Lord
But I wasn't prepared to receive 'em at all
Hit you with the cynical energy, I'ma send you a sign
And I'll put it inside of a rhyme for your mind to grow
I'll take all the pain that I ever had and no one could see
I kept bottled up, gotta progress, get better, step back
Just let me, I don't make an excuse, I've been to war
I got to elevate it, take you to a level that nobody has been
I'm in a different mindstate, I feel like its time to attack
I never relax, a lab boy emitted to gas
To give you some, in California where it never rains
Gonna take a whole lot of work and I'm motivated to get it
Sacrificed and every one of my goals
All that I know is I got a whole lot of problems
But failing is still not an option
I hope and I pray that one day we achieve
Cause man I gave my all till I had nothing left, lawd!
