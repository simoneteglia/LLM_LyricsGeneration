Ain't no chains around
Had we made the pilgrimage and found
The burning stretching man of inches
His fingers making good sound again
And he can still pick rings
Around you Saturn
Where I fly tangled through
A large hole with buried branches
And topical winds have bashed the ranches
Routinely this stuttering violence
Violates the silence
Of our common wish
For equal treatment and good fight
Hands all around the pioneers of light
The fiery one's reality is hushed
When not discovered, the people they are crushed
In secrets covered under
Whatever your business
So go now and find them high above
In hotels, higher ways circulating love
And rising as crown of all creation
With long hairs in lineup
And drunk as lords
They go to work and never play
Turn to stone and walk away
