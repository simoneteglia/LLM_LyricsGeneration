[MIMI]
Without you
The ground thaws
The rain falls
The grass grows
Without you
The seeds root
The flowers bloom
The children play
The stars gleam
The poets dream
The eagles fly
Without you
The earth turns
The sun burns
But I die
Without you
Without you
The breeze warms
The girl smiles
The cloud moves
Without you
The tides change
The boys run
The oceans crash
The crowds roar
The days soar
The babies cry
Without you
The moon glows
The river flows
But I die
Without you
[ROGER]
The world revives—
[MIMI]
Colors renew—
[BOTH]
But I know blue, only blue, lonely blue, within me blue
[MIMI]
Without you
Without you
The hand gropes
The ear hears
The pulse beats
[ROGER]
Without you
The eyes gaze
The legs walk
The lungs breathe
[ROGER (MIMI)]
The mind churns! (The mind churns!)
The heart yearns! (The heart yearns!)
[BOTH]
The tears dry
Without you
Life goes on
But I’m gone
Cause I die
[ROGER]
Without you
[MIMI]
Without you
[ROGER]
Without you
[BOTH]
Without you
