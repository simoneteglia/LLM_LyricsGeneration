[CHRISTIAN, spoken]
All you need is love
[SATINE, spoken]
You're being ridiculous
[CHRISTIAN, spoken]
All you need is love
[sung]
Just one night, give me just one night
[SATINE]
There's no way 'cause you can't pay
[CHRISTIAN]
In the name of love, one night in the name of love
[SATINE]
You crazy fool, I won't give in to you
[CHRISTIAN]
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love
[SATINE]
Love hurts
[CHRISTIAN]
All you have to do is play the game
[SATINE]
Love scars
[CHRISTIAN]
All you have to do is
Take on me
[SATINE]
No, no, no, it ain't me
[CHRISTIAN]
Take me on
[SATINE]
No, no, no because you'll be gone in a day or two
[CHRISTIAN]
I love you, always, forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
[SATINE]
Love is a battlefield
[CHRISTIAN]
Everything I will do for you
[SATINE]
Don't speak
I know just what you're thinking
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
[CHRISTIAN]
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl, you'll be my pride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
[SATINE]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love, but, a second hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart, when a heart can be broken?
[Christian and
Satine
,
Both
]
You're breaking my heart
S'pose I never, ever met you
[SATINE]
What's love got to do with it?
[CHRISTIAN]
Suppose we never fell in love
[SATINE]
Who needs a heart?
[CHRISTIAN]
Suppose I kept on singing love songs
[SATINE]
All of this music breaks my heart
[BOTH]
Yes, it breaks my heart
Yes it breaks my heart
[CHRISTIAN]
I can't help falling in love with you
[SATINE]
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I'm ashamed lying naked on the floor
[CHRISTIAN]
Take me on
[SATINE]
Illusion never changed into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
[CHRISTIAN]
They will see us coming from such great heights
"Come down now", they'll say
[BOTH]
Everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now", but we'll stay
[CHRISTIAN]
'Cause, love lifts us up where we belong
Where the eagles fly on a mountain high
[BOTH]
Love makes us act like we are fools
Throw our lives away for one happy day
[CHRISTIAN]
We can be heroes, just for one day
[SATINE]
Though nothing can keep us together
[CHRISTIAN]
We can steal time, just for one day
[BOTH]
We can be heroes forever and ever
We can be lovers just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
We can be lovers just for one day
[CHRISTIAN]
And you can tell everybody
[BOTH]
This is your song
It may be quite simple but, now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
[CHRISTIAN]
We can be heroes
[SATINE]
How wonderful life is
[CHRISTIAN]
We can be heroes
[SATINE]
How wonderful life is
[CHRISTIAN]
We can be heroes
[SATINE]
How wonderful life is
[BOTH]
While you're in the world
I will always love you
And I will always love you
And I will always love you
