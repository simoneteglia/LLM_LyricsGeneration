[Interlude]
The eagle begins its descent
*Bomb*
I wonder where it will end
Predatory energy
Predatory energy
The same way it can take and mine
The resources of the earth and turn it into a fuel
To run the machine and electrical world that we're becoming more and more a part of
There's a way that they have created to mine thе spirit
To feed off of our spirit and our essence
See, bеcause then, when they're feeding off of that, there's no way there can be any balance or any clarity
All these factors have produced a situation in which people have lost contact with their inner life
We live in a state of constant nervous tension and anxiety that was unknown a thousand years ago
The further we become separated from our spiritual reality, then the more powerless people feel
It's a disease of possession, and it drove the people mad, see
But because everybody was obedient
And going along with the established new terminology and things
It was called normal, but the behavior was very, very aggressive
Every insecurity and fear and paranoia that you have, alright
Everything you don't want to face, every self-doubt
Is the pollution left over from the mining of our essence, our spirit
Because it's in the best interest of the predator that we don't see clearly
And that is the story of this album
Any way you cut it, it can't stay as it is
