Murder bassline
I wanna fly like an eagle
I wanna sing like Sinatra
I've got a date with destruction
I wanna love like a mother
Listen up, let the lesson begin
Cause you're wrong and you know how to sin
As we dance on the razor's edge
As we dance on the razor's edge (murder)
Dance on the razor's edge
Dance on the razor's edge (murder)
Dance on the razor's edge (murder)
Dance on the razor's edge
All dressed up and ready to go
All dressed up and ready to go
All dressed up and ready to go
All dressed up and ready to-
I wanna dance
I wanna fly
I wanna fly like an eagle
I wanna sing like Sinatra
I've got a date with destruction
I wanna love like a mother
