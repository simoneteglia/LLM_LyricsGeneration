[Verse 1]
Black shadow hanging over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison running through your veins
[Chorus]
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
[Verse 2]
Black widow weaving evil notion
Dark secrets being spun in your web
Good men going down in your ocean
They can't swim 'cause they're tied to your bed
[Chorus]
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
[Post-Chorus]
You just cry wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom, haha
Oh, black widow
[Bridge]
Come on, weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got him tied to your bed
With your dark, dark secrets
And your green, green eyes
You black widow
[Chorus]
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
[Outro]
Evil sleeps beside you (Evil talks)
Evil talks around you (Yeah, evil walks)
Evil walks behind you
Evil walks
You're so bad
