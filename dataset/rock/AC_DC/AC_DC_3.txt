[Verse 1]
I was caught in the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round and I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced and I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew there was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums beating in my heart
The thunder of guns tore me apart
[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck
[Verse 2]
Went down the highway,
broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls, some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds
[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind
[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah
[Bridge 1]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow
[Solo]
[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said
[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine
[Chorus]
Thunderstruck, yeah-yeah-yeah
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
You've been thunderstruck
