[Verse 1]
I got a stereo and plenty of noise
I got twenty bucks in silver coins
I got a beer and a couple of joints
Now I just wanna hear Bon and Brian's voice
[Chorus]
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
Play it twice a day, seven days a week
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
The second-greatest band in history
[Verse 2]
I saw you on the shelf at Sanity
You were lookin' hot as
TNT
Took you home,
you shook me all night long
I never knew that rock and roll could be so strong
[Chorus]
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
Play it twice a day, seven days a week
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
The second-greatest band in history
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
Play it twice a day,
eight days a week
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
The second-greatest band in history
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
Play it twice a day, seven days a week
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
Full volume
in my Dad's GT
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
The neighbours hear it from up the street
(AC/DC CD, AC/DC CD)
The second-greatest band in history
[Outro]
And we are first!
