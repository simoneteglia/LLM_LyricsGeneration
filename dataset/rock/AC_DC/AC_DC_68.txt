[Verse 1]
Ah, you're the one I've waited for
I need your love more and more
I don't know what your name is
I don't know what your game is
I wanna take you tonight
Animal appetite
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a love hungry man
Yeah, I'm a love hungry man
[Verse 2]
Don't want no conversation
I need sweet sensation
And all I wanna do
Is make a meal out of you
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a love (love) hungry man
I got to get what I can
'Cause I'm a love (love) love hungry man
I'm tellin' you, yes I am
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Whoa, I'm your love (hungry man) hungry man
Oh baby, you're such a treat
(Love hungry man)
And you know, a man's got to eat
(I'm a love hungry man) You're the one I've waited for
Oh, yes you are
(I'm a love hungry man) I need your lovin' more and more
Yeah I do
'Cause I'm a love (love) love (love) hungry man
Oh, yes I am
I'm a love (love) love (love) hungry man
Just a little bit
Oh, I'm a love (love) love (love) hungry man
Oh oh, I'm a love (love) love (love) hungry man
I'm a love (love) love (love) hungry man
Oh, I'm a love (love) love (love) hungry man
Yes I am, ow
