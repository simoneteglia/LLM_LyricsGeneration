[Verse 1]
Loading up the battery, raise enough insanity
Beating out the old-time blues
Crawling up the walls, sleeping on a waterfall
Melting off that dew
[Pre-Chorus]
Strike one, strike two
Set your guns ablaze
Strike three, call emergency
You're gonna play it safe
[Verse 2]
Speeding up the road, tearing up the Highway Code
Ain’t gonna slow me down
No need to hesitate, ain't comin' up late
And hit the brakes
Don’t mess with fate
[Pre-Chorus]
Hot fight, rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, fire bright
Fire in the night
[Chorus]
Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Ooh, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red
[Interlude 1]
Now pay attention
[Verse 3]
Reputation on your mind, enemy within your sight
Fire up, fire straight, fire free
Situation on your mind in the pale moonlight
Run quick, run silent, run deep
[Pre-Chorus]
Hot fight, rough night
Dead in your sight
Fire light, oh fire bright
Fire in the night
[Chorus]
Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red
[Interlude 2]
Hey!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Station to station
Yeah, code red
Battle stations
Code, code red
Weapons ready
Code red
Fire one, fire two
Code red
[Outro]
Hey, code red
Code red
Hey
