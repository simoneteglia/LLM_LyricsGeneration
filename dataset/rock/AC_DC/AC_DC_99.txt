Trapped
You got trapped
Gone down a peg, said yes
[Verse 1]
You can dance through the night
Rock-roll music, itching to fight
Making love, drunk or stoned
Looking for dollars, get broken-boned
It's a game
His tongue is too tough to tame
Ends up the same, sweating in the rain
[Chorus]
I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out
There's a fly on the wall
[Verse 2]
Take a chance, take a bite
Rock-roll devil take me tonight
Like a bitch making heat
Beatin' on my chest, licking at my feet
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ending up the same, sweating in the rain
So watch out, there's a fly on the wall
[Chorus]
I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Yeah, I was trapped
[Solo]
[Chorus]
I was trapped like a fly on the wall
I was caged like a zoo animal
No escape from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
I was trapped (Like a fly on the wall)
I was caged (Like a zoo animal)
Enraged (From the fate that you make)
You're a snake, and I've had all I can take
There's a fly on the wall
