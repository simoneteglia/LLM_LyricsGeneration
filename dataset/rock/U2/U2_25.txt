[Verse 1]
Morning
Your toast, your tea and sugar
Read about the politician's lover
Go through the day like knife through butter
Why don't you?
[Verse 2]
You dress
In the colours of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair
[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone else's suicide
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
[Verse 3]
Dreams
It's a dirty business, dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where there's no daylight, there's no healing
No, no
[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
[Verse 4]
Hope
Hope is where the door is
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one else's pain
[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird, your dreams take flight
Like St. Francis covered in light
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
[Verse 1]
