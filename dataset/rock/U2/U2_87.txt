[Verse 1: The Edge]
Don't move
Don't talk out-a time
Don't think
Don't worry, everything's just fine
Just fine
Don't grab
Don't clutch
Don't hope for too much
Don't breathe
Don't achieve
Don't grieve without leave
Don't check, just balance on the fence
Don't answer
Don't ask
Don't try and make sense
Don't whisper
Don't talk
Don't run if you can walk
Don't cheat, compete
Don't miss the one beat
Don't travel by train
Don't eat
Don't spill
Don't piss in the drain
Don't make a will
Don't fill out any forms
Don't compensate
Don't cower
Don't crawl
Don't come around late
Don't hover at the gate
Don't take it on board
Don't fall on your sword
Just play another chord
If you feel you're getting bored
[Chorus: Bono]
I feel numb
I feel numb
Too much is not enough
[Verse 2: The Edge and
Bono
]
Don't change your brand
Gimme what you got
Don't listen to the band
Don't gape
Gimme what I don't get
Don't ape
Don't change your shape
Gimme some more
Have another grape
Too much is not enough
I feel numb
[Interlude: Bono]
Gimme some more
A piece of me, baby
I feel numb
[Verse 3: The Edge and
Bono
]
Don't plead
Don't bridle
Don't shackle
Don't grind
Gimme some more
Don't curve
Don't swerve
I feel numb
Lie, die, serve
Gimme some more
I feel numb
Don't theorize, realise, polarise
I feel numb
Chance, dance, dismiss, apologise
Gimme some more
Too much is not enough
Don't spy
Don't lie
Don't try
Imply
Detain
Explain
Start again
I feel numb
I feel numb
Don't triumph
Don't coax
Don't cling
Don't hoax
Don't freak
Peak
Don't leak
Don't speak
I feel numb
I feel numb
Don't project
Don't connect
Protect
Don't expect

I feel numb

I feel numb
Don't struggle

Don't borrow
Too much is not enough
Don't break
I feel numb
Don't fence
Don't steal
Don't pass
Don't press
Don't try
Don't feel
Gimme some more
I feel numb
Don't touch
Don't dive
Don't suffer
Don't rhyme
Don't fantasize
