[Verse 1]
Ice, your only rivers run cold
These city lights, they shine as silver and gold
Dug from the night, your eyes as black as coal
[Bridge]
Walk on by, walk on through
Walk till you run and don't look back
For here I am
[Verse 2]
Carnival, the wheels fly and the colours spin through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face in a dry and waterless place
[Chorus 1]
Walk on by, walk on through
So sad to besiege your love so head-on
Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking, but I, I think you know
Come on take me away, come on take me away
Come on take me home, home again
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 2]
And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no not I
Stay this time
,
stay tonight in a lie
Ever after is lovin' time
And if you save your love, save your sweet love
Don't push me too far, don't push me too far
Tonight, tonight, tonight
[Verse 1]
Ice, your only rivers run cold
These city lights, they shine as silver and gold
Dug from the night, your eyes as black as coal
[Bridge]
Walk on by, walk on through
Walk till you run and don't look back
For here I am
[Verse 2]
Carnival, the wheels fly and the colours spin through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face in a dry and waterless place
[Chorus 1]
Walk on by, walk on through
So sad to besiege your love so head-on
Stay this time, stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking, but I, I think you know
Come on take me away, come on take me away
Come on take me home, home again
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 2]
And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no not I
Stay this time
,
stay tonight in a lie
Ever after is lovin' time
And if you save your love, save your sweet love
Don't push me too far, don't push me too far
Tonight, tonight, tonight
