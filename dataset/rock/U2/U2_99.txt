[Verse 1]
Six o'clock in the morning
You're the last to hear the warning
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
You been falling off the sidewalk
Your lips move but you can't talk
Tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[Chorus]
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Be still
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman, I will (Oh)
[Verse 2]
Sunrise like a nosebleed
Your head hurts and you can't breathe
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
How far are you gonna go
Before you lose your way back home?
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[Chorus]
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman, be still
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman, I will
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I dreamed that I saw Dali
With a supermarket trolley
He was tryin' to throw his arms around a girl
He took an open-top beetle
Through the eye of a needle
He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world
[Chorus]
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman, be still
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman, I will
(Oh, and you just gotta, you just gotta [?])
[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
[Verse 4]
Nothing much to say, I guess
Just the same as all the rest
Been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
And a woman needs a man
Like a fish needs a bicycle
When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[Chorus]
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman, be still
Woman, be still
Be still
Woman, be still
Woman, I will
[Verse 1]
Six o'clock in the morning
You're the last to hear the warning
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world
You been falling off the sidewalk
Your lips move but you can't talk
Tryin' to throw your arms around the world
[Chorus]
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Be still
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman, I will (Oh)
[Verse 2]
Sunrise like a nosebleed
Your head hurts and you can't breathe
You been tryin' to throw your arms around the world

[Chorus]
Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you

Gonna run to you, run to you, run to you

Be still
Woman, be still
Woman, I will
