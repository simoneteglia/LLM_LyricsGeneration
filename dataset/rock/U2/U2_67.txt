[Verse 1]
In a little while surely you'll be mine
In a little while I'll be there
In a little while this hurt will hurt no more
I'll be home, love
[Verse 2]
When the night takes a deep breath
And the daylight has no air
If I crawl, if I come crawling home
Will you be there?
[Chorus]
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Oh hoo hoo hoo
[Verse 3]
In a little while I won't be blown by every breeze
Friday night running to Sunday on my knees
That girl, that girl she's mine
Well, I've known her since, since she was
[Verse 4]
A little girl with Spanish eyes
Oh, when I saw her in a pram they pushed her by
Ooh hoo, my how you've grown
Well it's been, been, it's been a little while
[Chorus]
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Slow down my beating heart
[Bridge]
A man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies
He lives on a star that's dying in the night
And follows in the trail the scatter of light
[Verse 5]
Turn it on
Turn it on, you turn me on (Mmm, yeah)
[Chorus]
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Slow down my beating heart
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Slowly, slowly love
[Outro]
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
[Verse 1]
In a little while surely you'll be mine
In a little while I'll be there
In a little while this hurt will hurt no more
I'll be home, love
[Verse 2]
When the night takes a deep breath
And the daylight has no air
If I crawl, if I come crawling home
Will you be there?
[Chorus]
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Oh hoo hoo hoo
[Verse 3]
In a little while I won't be blown by every breeze
Friday night running to Sunday on my knees
That girl, that girl she's mine
Well, I've known her since, since she was
[Verse 4]
A little girl with Spanish eyes
Oh, when I saw her in a pram they pushed her by
Ooh hoo, my how you've grown
Well it's been, been, it's been a little while
[Chorus]
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Slow down my beating heart
[Bridge]
A man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies
He lives on a star that's dying in the night
And follows in the trail the scatter of light
[Verse 5]
Turn it on
Turn it on, you turn me on (Mmm, yeah)
[Chorus]
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Slow down my beating heart
Oh hoo hoo hoo
Slowly, slowly love
[Outro]
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love
