[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control
[Verse 1: Bono]
You think it's easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think it's easier
To know your own tricks
Well, it's the hardest thing you'll ever do
[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you're not my troubles anymore
[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control
[Verse 2: Bono]
You think it's easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
And you think it's easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to
[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me then, and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you're not my troubles anymore
[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control (Someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control
[Bridge: Bono & Lykke Li]
God knows it's not easy
Taking on the shape of someone else's pain
God, now you can see me
I'm naked and I'm not afraid
My body's sacred and I'm not ashamed
[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control (Someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control (Someone else is in control)
[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control
[Verse 1: Bono]
You think it's easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think it's easier
To know your own tricks
Well, it's the hardest thing you'll ever do
[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you're not my troubles anymore
[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control
[Verse 2: Bono]
You think it's easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
And you think it's easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to
[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]

[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control (Someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (Oh no)
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control
[Bridge: Bono & Lykke Li]
