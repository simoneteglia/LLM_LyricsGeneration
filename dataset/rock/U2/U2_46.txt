[Verse 1]
Nothing to stop this being the best day ever
Nothing to keep us from where we should be
I wanted the world but you knew better
And that all we have is immortality
(There is a light)
[Chorus]
Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left (There is a light)
Love and love
is all we have left
You argue 'cause you can’t accept
Love is all we have left
[Verse 2]
Now you’re at the other end of a telescope
Seven billion stars in her eyes
So many stars, so many ways of seeing
Hey, this is no time not to be alive (There is a light)
[Chorus]
Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left (There is a light)
Love and love is all we have left
The only thing that can be kept
Love is all we have left
[Verse 1]
Nothing to stop this being the best day ever
Nothing to keep us from where we should be
I wanted the world but you knew better
And that all we have is immortality
(There is a light)
[Chorus]
Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left (There is a light)
Love and love
is all we have left
You argue 'cause you can’t accept
Love is all we have left
[Verse 2]
Now you’re at the other end of a telescope
Seven billion stars in her eyes
So many stars, so many ways of seeing
Hey, this is no time not to be alive (There is a light)
[Chorus]
Love and love is all we have left
A baby cries on a doorstep
Love is all we have left (There is a light)
Love and love is all we have left
The only thing that can be kept
Love is all we have left
