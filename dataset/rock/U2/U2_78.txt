[Verse 1]
October and the trees are stripped bare
Of all they wear
What do I care?
[Verse 2]
October and kingdoms rise
And kingdoms fall
But you go on
And on
[Verse 1]
October and the trees are stripped bare
Of all they wear
What do I care?
[Verse 2]
October and kingdoms rise
And kingdoms fall
But you go on
And on
