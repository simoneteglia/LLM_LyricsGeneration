[Intro]
This is a song called "Party Girl"
[Verse 1]
I know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
And she won't tell me her name
Oh no, not me
[Verse 2]
I know a boy
A boy called Trash, Trash Can
I know he does all that he can, wham bam
And she won't tell me his name
Oh no, not me
[Guitar Solo]
It's our hero
[Verse 3]
When I was three
I thought the world revolved around me
I was wrong
And so I sing along
And if you dance
Then dance with me
[Verse 4]
I know a girl
A girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
I know a boy
A boy called Trampoline
You know what I mean
[Outro]
I think I know what he wants
I think I know what he wants
I think I know what you want
I think I know what you want
I think I know what you want
I think I know what you want
I think I know what he wants
Well, thank you
