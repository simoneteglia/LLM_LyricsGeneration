[Verse 1]
We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
As the day begs the night for mercy, love
[Verse 2]
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows
Only scars carved into stone on the face of earth
[Verse 3]
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes
[Chorus]
You run like a river on at the sea
You run like a river runs to the sea
[Verse 4]
And in the world, a heart of darkness, a fire-zone
Where poets speak their heart then bleed for it
[Verse 5]
Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love
You know his blood still cries from the ground
[Chorus]
It runs like a river runs to the sea
It runs like a river to the sea
[Verse 6]
I don't believe in fancy roses or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful
[Verse 7]
I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill
[Chorus]
We run like a river runs to the sea
We run like a river to the sea
[Post-Chorus]
And when it's rainin', rainin' hard
That's when the rain will break the heart
Rainin', rainin' hard
Rainin' in your heart
Rainin', rain into
Rainin', rainin', rainin'
Rain into your
Rainin', ooh, ooh, yeah
Feel it
[Outro]
Oh, great ocean
Oh, great sea
Run to the ocean
Run to the sea
[Verse 1]
We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
As the day begs the night for mercy, love
[Verse 2]
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows
Only scars carved into stone on the face of earth
[Verse 3]
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes
[Chorus]
You run like a river on at the sea
You run like a river runs to the sea
[Verse 4]
And in the world, a heart of darkness, a fire-zone
Where poets speak their heart then bleed for it
[Verse 5]
Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love
You know his blood still cries from the ground
[Chorus]
It runs like a river runs to the sea
It runs like a river to the sea
[Verse 6]
I don't believe in fancy roses or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful
[Verse 7]
I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill
[Chorus]
We run like a river runs to the sea
We run like a river to the sea
[Post-Chorus]
And when it's rainin', rainin' hard
That's when the rain will break the heart
Rainin', rainin' hard
Rainin' in your heart
Rainin', rain into
Rainin', rainin', rainin'
Rain into your
Rainin', ooh, ooh, yeah
Feel it
[Outro]
Oh, great ocean
Oh, great sea
Run to the ocean
Run to the sea
