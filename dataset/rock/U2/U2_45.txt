[Verse 1]
Tough, you think you've got the stuff
You're telling me and anyone
You're hard enough
You don't have to put up a fight
You don't have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone
[Chorus]
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
[Verse 2]
We fight all the time
You and I, that's alright
We're the same soul
I don't need, I don't need to hear you say
That if we weren't so alike
You'd like me a whole lot more
[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone
[Chorus]
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
[Bridge]
I know that we don't talk
I'm sick of it all
Can you hear me when I sing
You're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in me...
[Pre-Chorus]
Where are we now?
Still got to let you know
A house doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone...
[Chorus]
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you that makes it hard to let go
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
Sometimes you can't make it
Best you can do is to fake it
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
[Verse 1]
Tough, you think you've got the stuff
You're telling me and anyone
You're hard enough
You don't have to put up a fight
You don't have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone
[Chorus]
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
[Verse 2]
We fight all the time
You and I, that's alright
We're the same soul
I don't need, I don't need to hear you say
That if we weren't so alike
You'd like me a whole lot more
[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone
[Chorus]
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
[Bridge]
I know that we don't talk
I'm sick of it all
Can you hear me when I sing
You're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in me...
[Pre-Chorus]
Where are we now?
Still got to let you know
A house doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone...
[Chorus]
And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you that makes it hard to let go
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
Sometimes you can't make it
Best you can do is to fake it
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
