[Verse 1]
You're dangerous 'cause you're honest
You're dangerous, you don't know what you want
Well, you left my heart empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt
Hey hey, sha-la-la
Hey hey
[Verse 2]
You're an accident waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass left there on the beach
Well, you tell me things I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me just out of reach
Hey hey, sha-la-la
Hey hey, sha-la-la
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?
[Verse 3]
Well, you stole it 'cause I needed the cash
And you killed it 'cause I wanted revenge
Well, you lied to me 'cause I asked you to
Baby, can we still be friends?
Hey hey, sha la la
Hey hey, sha la la
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?
[Bridge]
Ah, the deeper I spin
Ah, the hunter will sin for your ivory skin
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees, the river laughing at you and me
Hallelujah, heaven's white rose
The doors you open I just can't close
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
Your gypsy heart
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
And don't look back
Come on now love
Don't you look back
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses?
Who's gonna take the place of me?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who could tame the heart of thee?
[Verse 1]
You're dangerous 'cause you're honest
You're dangerous, you don't know what you want
Well, you left my heart empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt
Hey hey, sha-la-la
Hey hey
[Verse 2]
You're an accident waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass left there on the beach
Well, you tell me things I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me just out of reach
Hey hey, sha-la-la
Hey hey, sha-la-la
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?
[Verse 3]
Well, you stole it 'cause I needed the cash
And you killed it 'cause I wanted revenge
Well, you lied to me 'cause I asked you to
Baby, can we still be friends?
Hey hey, sha la la
Hey hey, sha la la
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?
[Bridge]
Ah, the deeper I spin
Ah, the hunter will sin for your ivory skin
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees, the river laughing at you and me
Hallelujah, heaven's white rose
The doors you open I just can't close
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
Your gypsy heart
Don't turn around
Don't turn around again
Don't turn around
And don't look back
Come on now love
Don't you look back
[Chorus]
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses?
Who's gonna take the place of me?
Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
Who could tame the heart of thee?
