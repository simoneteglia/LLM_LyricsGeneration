[Intro]
Unos, dos, tres, catorce!
(Turn it up loud, captain)
[Verse 1]
Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head, can't rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than a thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul, it can't be bought
Your mind can wander
[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel
Feel
[Verse 2]
The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel
Feel
[Post-Chorus]
Checkmated!
Just fun!
She made it in, yeah!
[Bridge]
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no one gets hurt
[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
We're at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel
Kneel
[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
