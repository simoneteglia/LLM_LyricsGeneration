[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness
[Verse 1]
In a parked car in a crowded street
You see your love made complete
Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness
[Verse 2]
Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness
[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness
[Bridge]
A little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense
[Verse 3]
Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets and no one to tell
Take the money, honey
Blindness
[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness
[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness
[Verse 1]
In a parked car in a crowded street
You see your love made complete
Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness
[Verse 2]
Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness
[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness
[Bridge]
A little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense
[Verse 3]
Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets and no one to tell
Take the money, honey
Blindness
[Chorus]
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness
