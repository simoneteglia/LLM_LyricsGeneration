[Verse 1]
And so she woke up
Woke up from where she was lyin' still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're goin'
Step on a steam train
Step out of the drivin' rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night
[Chorus]
Singing ah, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
[Verse 2]
Sweet the sin
Bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here
[Chorus]
Singing, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
[Bridge]
Ooh hoo
Ooh hoo
Ooh hoo
[Verse 3]
She runs through the streets
With eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea
She is raging, she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
[Chorus]
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 1]
And so she woke up
Woke up from where she was lyin' still
Said I gotta do something
About where we're goin'
Step on a steam train
Step out of the drivin' rain, maybe
Run from the darkness in the night
[Chorus]
Singing ah, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
[Verse 2]
Sweet the sin
Bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers
But I only see one way out
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here
[Chorus]
Singing, ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
Ah la la la de day
[Bridge]
Ooh hoo
Ooh hoo
Ooh hoo
[Verse 3]
She runs through the streets
With eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway
She brings me white golden pearls
Stolen from the sea
She is raging, she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
[Chorus]
She will suffer the needle chill
She's running to stand still
