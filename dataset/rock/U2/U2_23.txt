[Verse 1]
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
[Verse 2]
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
[Verse 3]
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name
[Pre-Chorus]
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
[Bridge]
We can hear you (Hear you)
We can hear you
We can hear you (Hear you, ooh)
[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will someday be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
[Outro]
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
[Verse 1]
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
[Verse 2]
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
[Verse 3]
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name
[Pre-Chorus]
I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way
[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
[Bridge]
We can hear you (Hear you)
We can hear you
We can hear you (Hear you, ooh)
[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will someday be returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard
[Outro]
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
