[Verse 1]
From father to son
The blood runs thin
Ooh, see the faces frozen still
Against the wind
[Verse 2]
The seam is split
The coal-face cracked
The lines are long
There's no going back
[Verse 3]
Through hands of steel
And heart of stone
Our labour day
Has come and gone
[Pre-Chorus]
They leave me holdin' on
In Red Hill Town
See the lights go down on
[Chorus]
Hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
[Verse 4]
The glass is cut
The bottle run dry
Our love runs cold
In the caverns of the night
[Verse 5]
We're wounded by fear
Injured in doubt
I can lose myself
You I can't live without
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you keep me holdin' on
In Red Hill Town
See the lights go down on
[Chorus]
I’m hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
Hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
On to
[Bridge]
We scorch the earth
Set fire to the sky
And we stooped so low
To reach so high
[Verse 6]
A link is lost
The chain undone
We wait all day
For night to come
And it comes
(Like a hunter, child)
[Chorus]
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
Love, slowly stripped away
Love has seen its better day
Hangin' on
Lights go out on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill Town
Lights go down on Red Hill
[Verse 1]
From father to son
The blood runs thin
Ooh, see the faces frozen still
Against the wind
[Verse 2]
The seam is split
The coal-face cracked
The lines are long
There's no going back
[Verse 3]
Through hands of steel
And heart of stone
Our labour day
Has come and gone
[Pre-Chorus]
They leave me holdin' on
In Red Hill Town
See the lights go down on
[Chorus]
Hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
[Verse 4]
The glass is cut
The bottle run dry
Our love runs cold
In the caverns of the night
[Verse 5]
We're wounded by fear
Injured in doubt
I can lose myself
You I can't live without
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you keep me holdin' on
In Red Hill Town
See the lights go down on
[Chorus]
I’m hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
Hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
On to
[Bridge]
We scorch the earth
Set fire to the sky
And we stooped so low
To reach so high
[Verse 6]
A link is lost
The chain undone
We wait all day
For night to come

(Like a hunter, child)
[Chorus]
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm still waiting
I'm hangin' on
You're all that's left to hold on to
Love, slowly stripped away
Love has seen its better day
Hangin' on
Lights go out on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill
The lights go down on Red Hill Town
Lights go down on Red Hill
