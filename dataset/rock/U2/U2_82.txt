[Verse 1]
Give me one more chance and you'll be satisfied
Give me two more chances, you won't be denied
Well, my heart is where it's always been
My head is somewhere in between
Give me one more chance, let me be your lover tonight
[Chorus]
You're the real thing
Yeah, the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing
[Verse 2]
Give me one last chance and I'm gonna make you sing
Give me half a chance to ride on the waves that you bring
You're honey child to a swarm of bees
Gonna blow right through ya like a breeze
Give me one last dance, we'll slide down the surface of things
[Chorus]
You're the real thing
Yeah, the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing
[Bridge]
We're free to fly the crimson sky
The sun won't melt our wings tonight
Oh now, oh yeah, here she comes
Take me higher, take me higher
You take me higher, you take me higher
[Chorus]
You're the real thing
Yeah, the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
[Verse 1]
Give me one more chance and you'll be satisfied
Give me two more chances, you won't be denied
Well, my heart is where it's always been
My head is somewhere in between
Give me one more chance, let me be your lover tonight
[Chorus]
You're the real thing
Yeah, the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing
[Verse 2]
Give me one last chance and I'm gonna make you sing
Give me half a chance to ride on the waves that you bring
You're honey child to a swarm of bees
Gonna blow right through ya like a breeze
Give me one last dance, we'll slide down the surface of things
[Chorus]
You're the real thing
Yeah, the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing
[Bridge]
We're free to fly the crimson sky
The sun won't melt our wings tonight
Oh now, oh yeah, here she comes
Take me higher, take me higher
You take me higher, you take me higher
[Chorus]
You're the real thing
Yeah, the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
Even better than the real thing
