[Verse 1]
Midnight, our sons and daughters
Were cut down and taken from us
Hear their heartbeat
We hear their heartbeat
[Verse 2]
In the wind we hear their laughter
In the rain we see their tears
Hear their heartbeat
We hear their heartbeat
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 3]
Night hangs like a prisoner
Stretched over black and blue
Hear their heartbeats
We hear their heartbeats
[Verse 4]
In the trees our sons stand naked
Through the walls our daughters cry
See their tears
In the rainfall
[Verse 1]
Midnight, our sons and daughters
Were cut down and taken from us
Hear their heartbeat
We hear their heartbeat
[Verse 2]
In the wind we hear their laughter
In the rain we see their tears
Hear their heartbeat
We hear their heartbeat
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 3]
Night hangs like a prisoner
Stretched over black and blue
Hear their heartbeats
We hear their heartbeats
[Verse 4]
In the trees our sons stand naked
Through the walls our daughters cry
See their tears
In the rainfall
