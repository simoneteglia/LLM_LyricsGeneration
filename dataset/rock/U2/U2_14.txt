[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
[Chorus]
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
[Verse 2]
Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, says
[Pre-Chorus]
Say it's true, it's true
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one
[Chorus]
I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh, oh-oh-oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight
[Chorus]
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
[Verse 3]
And so we're told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes New Year's Day
[Outro]
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
[Chorus]
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
[Verse 2]
Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, says
[Pre-Chorus]
Say it's true, it's true
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one
[Chorus]
I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh, oh-oh-oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight
[Chorus]
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
[Verse 3]
And so we're told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Nothing changes New Year's Day
[Outro]
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
On New Year's Day
