[Verse 1]
Face down on a broken street
There's a man in the corner in a pool of misery
I'm in a white van
As a red sea covers the ground
[Verse 2]
Metal crash, I can't tell what it is
But I take a look, and now I'm sorry I did
5:30 on a Friday night
Thirty-three good people cut down
[Refrain]
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
[Verse 3]
Face down on a pillow of shame
There's some girls with a needle trying to spell my name
My body's not a canvas
My body's now a toilet wall
[Refrain]
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
[Chorus]
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
[Verse 4]
Boy sees his father crushed under the weight
Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate
Blue mink Ford
I’m gonna detonate and you're dead
[Verse 5]
Blood in the house
Blood on the street
The worst things in the world are justified by belief
Registration one three eight five W Z
[Refrain]
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
[Chorus]
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear
[Verse 1]
Face down on a broken street
There's a man in the corner in a pool of misery
I'm in a white van
As a red sea covers the ground
[Verse 2]
Metal crash, I can't tell what it is
But I take a look, and now I'm sorry I did
5:30 on a Friday night
Thirty-three good people cut down
[Refrain]
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
[Verse 3]
Face down on a pillow of shame
There's some girls with a needle trying to spell my name
My body's not a canvas
My body's now a toilet wall
[Refrain]
I don't believe anymore
I don't believe anymore
[Chorus]
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
Raised by wolves
We were raised by wolves
Raised by wolves
Stronger than fear
If I open my eyes
You disappear

Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate
