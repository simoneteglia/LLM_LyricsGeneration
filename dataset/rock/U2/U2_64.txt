[Verse 1: Bono]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life (One life)
It's one need in the night (In the night)
One love (One love), we get to share it (Oh)
Leaves you darlin', if you don't care for it
Mary
[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without?
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
[Bridge: Bono & Mary J Blige]
One, one
One, one
One, one
One, one
[Verse 3: Mary J Blige]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
Well, did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
See, we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got
'Cause all you got is hurt
[Verse 4: Bono & Mary J Blige]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters and my brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
[Post-Chorus]
One, one
One, one
One, one
[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
One love, one love
[Verse 1: Bono]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now
You got someone to blame?
You say one love, one life (One life)
It's one need in the night (In the night)
One love (One love), we get to share it (Oh)
Leaves you darlin', if you don't care for it
