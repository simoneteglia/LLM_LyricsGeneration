[Verse 1]
In the howlin' wind
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below
[Chorus]
Whoo, whooo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
[Verse 2]
In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher
[Chorus]
Whoo, whooo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue, oh
Bullet the blue, oh
[Verse 3]
So this guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
Slappin' 'em down
One hundred, two hundred
And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
[Verse 4]
Across the mud huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
And take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you can hear the city groan
Outside, it's America
Outside, it's America
America
[Guitar solo]
[Outro]
See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howling the women and children
Who run into the arms
Of America
[Verse 1]
In the howlin' wind
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below
[Chorus]
Whoo, whooo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue
[Verse 2]
In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher
[Chorus]
Whoo, whooo
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue, oh
Bullet the blue, oh
[Verse 3]
So this guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills

And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
[Verse 4]

Through the alleys of a quiet city street
And take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
