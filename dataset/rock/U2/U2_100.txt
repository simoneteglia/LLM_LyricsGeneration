[Verse 1]
I tied myself with wire
To let the horses run free
Playing with the fire
Until the fire played with me, mmm
[Verse 2]
The stone was semi-precious
And we were barely conscious
Two souls too smart to be
In the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day
[Verse 3]
We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
It's not if I believe in love
If love believes in me
Oh, believe in me
[Chorus]
At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me
[Verse 4]
I've been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
My body's now a begging bowl
That's begging to get back, begging to get back
To my heart
To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control
[Chorus]
I was punching in the numbers
At the ATM machine
I could see in the reflection
A face staring back at me
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I was speeding on the subway
Through the stations of the cross
Every eye looking every other way
Counting down till the pain will stop
At the moment of surrender
Of vision over visibility
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me
[Outro]
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
[Verse 1]
I tied myself with wire
To let the horses run free
Playing with the fire
Until the fire played with me, mmm
[Verse 2]
The stone was semi-precious
And we were barely conscious
Two souls too smart to be
In the realm of certainty
Even on our wedding day
[Verse 3]
We set ourselves on fire
Oh God, do not deny her
It's not if I believe in love
If love believes in me
Oh, believe in me
[Chorus]
At the moment of surrender
I folded to my knees
I did not notice the passers-by
And they did not notice me
[Verse 4]
I've been in every black hole
At the altar of the dark star
My body's now a begging bowl
That's begging to get back, begging to get back

To the rhythm of my soul
To the rhythm of my unconsciousness
To the rhythm that yearns
To be released from control

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
