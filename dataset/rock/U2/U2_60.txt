[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Lover, I'm off the streets
I'm gonna go where the bright lights and the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire
Desire
[Verse 2]
She's the candle burnin' in my room
Yeah, I'm like the needle, the needle and spoon
Over the counter with a shotgun
Pretty soon everybody's got one
[Chorus]
And the fever when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire
(Ready)
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
And the fever gettin' higher
Desire
Desire
[Post-Chorus]
(Burning, burning)
[Verse 3]
She's the dollars, she's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise in the year of election
Oh sister, I can't let you go
I'm like a preacher stealin' hearts at a travellin' show
For love or money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
[Chorus]
And the fever gettin' higher
Desire
Desire
Desire
Desire
(Okay)
[Harmonica Solo]
[Outro]
Desire
Desire
(Alright)
