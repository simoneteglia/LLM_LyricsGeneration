[Verse 1]
I went out walkin' through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walkin' under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye
[Chorus]
Yeah, I went with nothin'
Nothin' but the thought of you
I went wandering
[Verse 2]
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it
I went out riding, down that ol' eight-lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name
[Chorus]
I went with nothin'
But the thought you'd be there, too
Lookin' for you
[Interlude]
I went out there in search of experience
To taste and to touch and to feel as much
As a man can before he repents
[Verse 3]
I went out searching, looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking with a Bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up, Jesus I'll be home soon
Yeah, I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon
[Outro]
Yeah, I left with nothin'
But the thought you'd be there, too
Lookin' for you
Yeah, I left with nothin'
Nothin' but the thought of you
I went wandering
[Verse 1]
I went out walkin' through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walkin' under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye
[Chorus]
Yeah, I went with nothin'
Nothin' but the thought of you
I went wandering
[Verse 2]
I went drifting through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it
I went out riding, down that ol' eight-lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name
[Chorus]
I went with nothin'
But the thought you'd be there, too
Lookin' for you
[Interlude]
