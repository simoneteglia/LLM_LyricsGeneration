[Intro]
Gloria, Gloria
Two, three, four
[Verse 1]
I try to sing this song
I, I try to stand up
But I can't find my feet
I try, I try to speak up
But only in you, I'm complete
[Chorus]
Gloria
In te Domine
Gloria
Exultate
Gloria
Gloria
Oh, Lord, loosen my lips
[Verse 2]
I try to sing this song
I, I try to get in
But I can't find the door
The door is open
You're standing there, you let me in
[Chorus]
Gloria
In te Domine
Gloria
Exultate
Oh, Lord
If I had anything
Anything at all
I'd give it to you
I'd give it to you
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Gloria
In te Domine
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
In te Domine
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
In te Domine
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
In te Domine
