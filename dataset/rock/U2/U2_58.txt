[Verse 1]
I am made of all that I'm afraid of
Most afraid of losing you
Hell's the season
You're the reason that I even dreamt of getting through
[Pre-Chorus]
I, I can feel your body shakin'
I, I will meet you where the waves are breakin'
[Chorus]
Baby, it's a red flag day
Oh baby, let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before
Baby, it's a red flag day (A red flag day)
Baby, let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place (A red flag day)
You can't see when it's yours
(Red flag day, hey)
(Red flag day, hey)
[Verse 2]
Sun comes here and oceanic feeling
Sky will soon be clear
Today we can't afford to be afraid of what we fear
[Pre-Chorus]
I, I can feel your body shaking
I, I will meet you where the waves are breaking
[Chorus]
Baby, it's a red flag day
Baby, let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before
Baby, it's a red flag day (A red flag day)
Baby, let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place (A red flag day)
You can't see when it's yours
(Red flag day, hey)
Baby, it's a red flag day
(Red flag day, hey)
[Bridge]
Not even news today
So many lost in the sea last night
The one word that the sea can’t say
Is no, no, no, no
[Outro]
Baby, it's a red flag day (Red flag day, red flag day)
Baby, it's a red flag day (Red flag day, red flag day)
Ah (Red flag day, red flag day)
Ah (Red flag day, red flag day)
Baby, let's get in the water
[Verse 1]
I am made of all that I'm afraid of
Most afraid of losing you
Hell's the season
You're the reason that I even dreamt of getting through
[Pre-Chorus]
I, I can feel your body shakin'
I, I will meet you where the waves are breakin'
[Chorus]
Baby, it's a red flag day
Oh baby, let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before
Baby, it's a red flag day (A red flag day)
Baby, let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place (A red flag day)
You can't see when it's yours
(Red flag day, hey)
(Red flag day, hey)
[Verse 2]
Sun comes here and oceanic feeling
Sky will soon be clear
Today we can't afford to be afraid of what we fear
[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Baby, it's a red flag day
Baby, let's get in the water
Taken out by a wave
Where we've never been before
Baby, it's a red flag day (A red flag day)
Baby, let's go a bit further
Paradise is a place (A red flag day)
You can't see when it's yours
(Red flag day, hey)
Baby, it's a red flag day
(Red flag day, hey)

Baby, it's a red flag day (Red flag day, red flag day)
Baby, it's a red flag day (Red flag day, red flag day)
Ah (Red flag day, red flag day)
Ah (Red flag day, red flag day)
Baby, let's get in the water
