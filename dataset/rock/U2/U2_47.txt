[Verse 1]
The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin' to hold on
To what you used to be
I'm so glad the past is all gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?
[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
[Verse 2]
Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you don't see so well
The future's gonna land on you
[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?
[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
You're on a piece of ground above a volcano
[Bridge]
You were alone
And now you're not alone
You were alone
You are rock 'n' roll
You and I are rock 'n' roll
You are rock 'n' roll
You and I are rock 'n' roll
[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
You're on a piece of ground above a volcano
[Verse 1]
The world is spinning fast tonight
You can hurt yourself tryin' to hold on
To what you used to be
I'm so glad the past is all gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?
[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
[Verse 2]
Your eyes were like landing lights
They used to be the clearest blue
Now you don't see so well
The future's gonna land on you
[Pre-Chorus]
Been out in the wild
Been out in the night
Been out of your mind
Do you live here or is this a vacation?
[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
You're on a piece of ground above a volcano
[Bridge]
You were alone
And now you're not alone
You were alone
You are rock 'n' roll
You and I are rock 'n' roll
You are rock 'n' roll
You and I are rock 'n' roll
[Chorus]
Oh, volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
Volcano
Something in you wants to blow
Volcano
You don't wanna, you don't wanna know
You're on a piece of ground above a volcano
