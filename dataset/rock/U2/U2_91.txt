[Intro]
What do you want?
What do you want?
[Verse 1]
Zooropa:
Vorsprung durch Technik
Zooropa:
be all that you can be
Be a winner
Eat to get slimmer
[Verse 2]
Zooropa:
a bluer kind of white
Zooropa:
it could be yours tonight
We're mild and green
And squeaky clean
[Interlude]
What do you want?
What do you want?
[Verse 3]
Zooropa:
better by design
Zooropa:
fly the friendly skies
Through appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence
[Pre-Chorus]
And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I have no reasons
No reasons to get back
And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we've got
[Chorus]
(Zooropa)
Don't worry baby, it'll be alright
(Zooropa)
You got the right shoes
(Zooropa)
To get you through the night
(Zooropa)
It's cold outside, but brightly lit
(Zooropa)
Skip the subway
(Zooropa)
Let's go to the overground
Get your head out of the mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby
Overground
[Post-Chorus]
No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from?
[Chorus]
(Zooropa)
Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright
(Zooropa)
Uncertainty can be a guiding light
(Zooropa)
I hear voices, ridiculous voices
(Zooropa)
I'm in the slipstream
(Zooropa)
Let's go, let's go overground
(Zooropa)
Take your head out of the mud baby
[Outro]
She's gonna dream up
The world she wants to live in
She's gonna dream out loud
She's gonna dream out loud
Dream out loud
