[Verse 1]
Heaven on Earth
We need it now
I'm sick of all of this
Hanging around
Sick of sorrow
Sick of the pain
Sick of hearing again and again
That there's gonna be
Peace on Earth
[Verse 2]
Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies
They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's already gone too far
Who said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt?
[Chorus]
Jesus, can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line?
Peace on Earth
Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
No whos or whys
No one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth
She never got to say goodbye
To see the colour in his eyes
Now he's in the dirt
Peace on Earth
[Verse 3]
They're reading names out
Over the radio
All the folks, the rest of us
Won't get to know
Sean and Julia
Gareth, Ann and Breda
Their lives are bigger than
Any big idea
[Chorus]
Jesus, can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line?
Peace on Earth
To tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
Jesus, in the song you wrote
The words are sticking in my throat
Peace on Earth
Hear it every Christmas time
But hope and history won't rhyme
So what's it worth?
This peace on Earth
[Outro]
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
[Verse 1]
Heaven on Earth
We need it now
I'm sick of all of this
Hanging around
Sick of sorrow
Sick of the pain
Sick of hearing again and again
That there's gonna be
Peace on Earth
[Verse 2]
Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies
They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's already gone too far
Who said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt?
[Chorus]
Jesus, can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line?
Peace on Earth
Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
No whos or whys
No one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth
She never got to say goodbye
To see the colour in his eyes
Now he's in the dirt
Peace on Earth

[Outro]
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
