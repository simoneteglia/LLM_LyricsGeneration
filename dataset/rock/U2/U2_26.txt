[Verse 1]
The winter doesn't want you, it haunts you
Summer serenading's a long way from this frozen place, your face
Our teacher, our preacher, it's nature
And like flowers growing in a bomb crater
From nothing, a rose, it grows
[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We've one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love (Summer of love)
Summer of love (Summer of love)
[Verse 2]
Freezing, we're leaving, believing
That all we need's ahead of us somewhere
In a summer to come
So we run
[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We've one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love (Summer of love)
A summer of love (Summer of love)
[Bridge]
Oh, and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh, the same oceans crossed
For some it's pleasure, for some it's pain
[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
In the rubble of Aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love
A summer of love
[Verse 1]
The winter doesn't want you, it haunts you
Summer serenading's a long way from this frozen place, your face
Our teacher, our preacher, it's nature
And like flowers growing in a bomb crater
From nothing, a rose, it grows
[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We've one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love (Summer of love)
Summer of love (Summer of love)
[Verse 2]
Freezing, we're leaving, believing
That all we need's ahead of us somewhere
In a summer to come
So we run
[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We've one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love (Summer of love)
A summer of love (Summer of love)
[Bridge]
Oh, and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh, the same oceans crossed
For some it's pleasure, for some it's pain
[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
In the rubble of Aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love
A summer of love
