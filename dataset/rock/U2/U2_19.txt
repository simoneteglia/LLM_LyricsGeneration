[Verse 1]
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again
I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones
[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
[Verse 2]
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
For years, I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away
[Chorus]
'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
[Bridge]
Are we tough enough for ordinary love?
[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
[Verse 1]
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again
I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones
[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
[Verse 2]
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
For years, I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away
[Chorus]
'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
[Bridge]
Are we tough enough for ordinary love?
[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
