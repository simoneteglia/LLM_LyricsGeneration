[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you
[Verse 3]
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
[Verse 4]
My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live
With or without you
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you
[Outro]
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you
[Verse 3]
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
[Verse 4]
My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live
With or without you
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you
[Outro]
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
