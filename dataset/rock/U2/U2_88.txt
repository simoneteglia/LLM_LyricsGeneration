[Verse 1]
And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning
Lights in the distance
[Verse 2]
And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, desire time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight, a high road
A high road out from here
[Verse 3]
The city walls are all gone down
The dust, a smokescreen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance
[Verse 4]
And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill as the valley explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of its own
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, some away, oh come away, oh come
Oh come away, say I
Oh come away, oh come away, oh come
Oh come away, say I
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run
And still we run
We run and don't look back
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight
Tonight
[Bridge]
I'll be there tonight
I believe
I'll be there, so high
I'll be there tonight
Tonight
Oh come away and say, you say, oh come
Oh come away, oh, you say
[Verse 5]
The wind will crack in wintertime
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words
Just a scream, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Tonight we'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again
Tonight
[Verse 6]
And your heart beats so slow
Through the rain and falling snow
Across the fields of mourning
Lights in the distance
[Verse 7]
Ah, don't sorrow, no, don't weep
For tonight at last
I am coming home
I am coming home
[Verse 1]
And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning
Lights in the distance
[Verse 2]
And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, desire time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight, a high road
A high road out from here
[Verse 3]
The city walls are all gone down
The dust, a smokescreen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance
[Verse 4]
And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill as the valley explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of its own
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, some away, oh come away, oh come
Oh come away, say I
Oh come away, oh come away, oh come
Oh come away, say I
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
On borderland we run
And still we run
We run and don't look back
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight
Tonight
[Bridge]
I'll be there tonight
I believe
I'll be there, so high
I'll be there tonight
Tonight
Oh come away and say, you say, oh come
Oh come away, oh, you say
[Verse 5]
The wind will crack in wintertime
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words
Just a scream, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

I am coming home
I am coming home
