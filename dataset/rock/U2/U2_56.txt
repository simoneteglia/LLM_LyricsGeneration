[Verse 1]
Roam
The phone is where I live till I get home
And when the doorbell rings
You tell me that I have a key
I ask you how you know it's me
[Verse 2]
The road
No road without a turn and if there was
The road would be too long
What keeps us standing in this view
Is the view that we can be brand new
[Chorus]
The landlady takes me up in the air
I go, I go where I would not dare
The landlady shows me the stars up there
I'm weightless
Weightless when she is there
And I'll never know
Never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke
It was you that always paid the rent
(Oh yeah, oh)
[Verse 3]
Space
Her place is where I found my parking space
And when I'm losing ground
You know she gives it back to me
She whispers, "Don't do, just be"
[Chorus]
The landlady takes me up in the air
I go, I go where I would not dare
The landlady shows me the stars up there
I'm weightless
Weightless when she is there
And I'll never know
Never know what starving poets meant
'Cause when I was broke
It was you that always paid the rent
[Outro]
Every wave that broke me
Every song that wrote me
Every dawn that woke me
Was to get me home to you, see
Every soul that left me
Every heart that kept me
The strangers that protected me
To bring me back to you
Every magic potion
Every false emotion
How unswerving our devotion
To the lies we know are almost true
Every sweet confusion
Every grand illusion
I will win and call it losing
If the prize is not for you
[Verse 1]
