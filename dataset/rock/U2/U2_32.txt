[Verse 1]
California, then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well, that's what took me where I need to be
Which is here
Out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California, at the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does
[Chorus]
Woah, all I know
And all I need to know
Is there is no
Yeah, there is no end to love
[Verse 2]
I didn't call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyone's a star in our town
It's just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom
In a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California, blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
I've seen for myself
There's no end to grief
That's how I know
[Chorus]
Woah, that's how I know
And why I need to know
That there is no
Yeah, there is no end to love
Woah, all I know and all I need to know
Is there is no
Yeah, there is no end to love
(There is no end to love)
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Woah, all I know
And all I need to know
Is there is no
Yeah, there is no end to love
Woah, we come and go
Stolen days you don't give back
Stolen days are just enough
