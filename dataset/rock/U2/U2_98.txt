[Verse 1]
Was a Monday morning
'Bout a quarter past four
You were busy dreaming
So what did you wake up  for
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you a stranger in your own life?
What are you hiding behind those eyes?
Is no one looking for you there?
[Chorus]
You know your song saved my life
I don't sing it, just so I can get by
Won't you hear me when I tell you, darlin'
I sing it to survive
[Verse 2]
You're looking for a miracle
The kind that science can't explain
The man you carry in your heart
Is only comfortable when he's in pain
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you a stranger in your own life?
What are you hiding behind those eyеs?
Can anyone find you there
Or just mе?
[Chorus]
You know your song saved my life
I don't sing it, just so I can get by
Won't you hear me when I tell you, darlin'
I sing it to survive
[Outro]
Your song saved my life
The worst and the best days of my life
I was broken, now I'm open, your love keeps me alive
It keeps me alive
Your song saved my life
The worst and the best days of my life
Your song saved my life
Song saved my, song saved my
Your song saved my life
Your song got me through tonight
Your song saved my life
Song saved my, song saved my life
[Verse 1]
Was a Monday morning
'Bout a quarter past four
You were busy dreaming
So what did you wake up  for
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you a stranger in your own life?
What are you hiding behind those eyes?
Is no one looking for you there?
[Chorus]
You know your song saved my life
I don't sing it, just so I can get by
Won't you hear me when I tell you, darlin'

The worst and the best days of my life
Your song saved my life
Song saved my, song saved my
Your song saved my life
Your song got me through tonight
Your song saved my life
Song saved my, song saved my life
