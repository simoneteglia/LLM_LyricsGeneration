[Intro]
One two three four
I will follow
[Verse 1]
I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
And I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see
[Verse 2]
A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?
[Chorus]
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
[Verse 3]
I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found
[Chorus]
Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
[Bridge]
Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes
Your, your, your eyes
Your eyes, just give me
Your, your, your eyes
[Chorus]
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
[Outro]
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
Follow
