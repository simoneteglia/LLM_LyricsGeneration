[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy
God, I know I'm one
[Verse 1: Bono]
I cried to my daddy on the telephone: "How long now"?
Until the clouds unroll and you come down, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I cried to my daddy on the telephone: "How long now"?
Until the clouds unroll and you come home, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent
[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, cha, hey!
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Bono]
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
[Verse 3: Bono]
A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now?
Until a weather change condemns belief, how long now?
When the night watchman lets in the thief, what's wrong now?
[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, cha, hey!
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Bono]
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
