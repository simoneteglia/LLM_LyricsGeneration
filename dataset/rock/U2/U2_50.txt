[Verse 1]
A dinosaur wonders why it still walks the earth, yeah
A meteor promises it's not gonna hurt, yeah
Earthquakes always happen when you're in bed, Fred
The house shakes, maybe it was something I said, Ned
[Pre-Chorus]
Go easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go easy on me, easy on me, brother
[Chorus]
When the lights go out
And you throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out
Don’t you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
[Verse 2]
Statues fall, democracy is flat on its back, Jack
We had it all and what we had is not coming back, Zac
A big mouth says the people, they don't wanna be free for free
The blackout, is this an extinction event we see?
[Pre-Chorus]
Go easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go easy on me, easy on me, now
[Chorus]
When the lights go out
And you throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out
Don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
[Post-Chorus]
When the lights go out (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
When the lights go out (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
[Bridge]
Blackout
It's clear
Who you are will appear
Blackout
No fear
So glad that we are all still here (Here)
When the lights go out (Oh)
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
[Chorus]
When the lights go out
And you throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out
Don't you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
[Post-Chorus]
When the lights go out (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
When the lights go out (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
[Verse 1]
A dinosaur wonders why it still walks the earth, yeah
A meteor promises it's not gonna hurt, yeah
Earthquakes always happen when you're in bed, Fred
The house shakes, maybe it was something I said, Ned
[Pre-Chorus]
Go easy on me, easy on me, brother
Go easy on me, easy on me, brother
[Chorus]
When the lights go out
And you throw yourself about
In the darkness where you learn to see
When the lights go out
Don’t you ever doubt
The light that we can really be
[Verse 2]

When the lights go out (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
When the lights go out
When the lights go out

When the lights go out (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
When the lights go out
