[Verse 1]
And if the terrors of the night
Come creeping into your days
And the world comes stealing children from your room
Guard your innocence from hallucination
And know that darkness always gathers around the light
[Chorus]
There is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
[Verse 2]
When the wind screams and shouts
And the sea is a dragon's tail
And the ship that stole your heart away sets sail
When all you've left is leaving
And all you got is grieving
And all you know is needing
(Da da da da, ah da da da, da da)
[Chorus]
If there is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause this is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
[Verse 3]
I know the world is dumb
But you don't have to be
I've got a question for the child in you before it leaves
Are you tough enough to be kind?
Do you know your heart has its own mind?
Darkness gathers around the light
Hold on, hold on
[Chorus]
There is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
[Post-Chorus]
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
[Verse 1]
And if the terrors of the night
Come creeping into your days
And the world comes stealing children from your room
Guard your innocence from hallucination
And know that darkness always gathers around the light
[Chorus]
There is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
[Verse 2]
When the wind screams and shouts
And the sea is a dragon's tail
And the ship that stole your heart away sets sail
When all you've left is leaving
And all you got is grieving
And all you know is needing
(Da da da da, ah da da da, da da)
[Chorus]
If there is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause this is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
[Verse 3]
I know the world is dumb
But you don't have to be
I've got a question for the child in you before it leaves
Are you tough enough to be kind?
Do you know your heart has its own mind?
Darkness gathers around the light
Hold on, hold on
[Chorus]
There is a light we can't always see
If there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out
[Post-Chorus]
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
