[Verse 1]
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y'know I don't see you when she walks in the room
[Verse 2]
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child
[Chorus]
Love, we shine like a burning star
A man will beg, a man will crawl
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
On the sheer face of love like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all
[Verse 3]
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief
For love
[Chorus]
Love, we shine like a burning star
A man will rise, a man will fall
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
From the sheer face of love like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
[Chorus]
Love, we shine like a burning star
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
Love, we shine like a burning star
A man will rise, a man will fall
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
From the sheer face of love like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
[Verse 4]
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploding 'cause of one man's lie
Look I gotta go, yeah, I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrange
[Verse 1]
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y'know I don't see you when she walks in the room
[Verse 2]
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child
[Chorus]
Love, we shine like a burning star
A man will beg, a man will crawl
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
On the sheer face of love like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all
[Verse 3]
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief
For love
[Chorus]
Love, we shine like a burning star
A man will rise, a man will fall
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
From the sheer face of love like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
[Chorus]
Love, we shine like a burning star
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
Love, we shine like a burning star
A man will rise, a man will fall
We're fallin' from the sky tonight
From the sheer face of love like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all
[Verse 4]
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
The universe exploding 'cause of one man's lie
Look I gotta go, yeah, I'm running outta change
There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrange
