[Intro]
Sometimes I feel like I don't know
Sometimes I feel like checking out
I wanna get it wrong
Can't always be strong
And love, it won't be long...
[Verse 1]
Oh, sugar, don't you cry
Oh, child, wipe the tears from your eye
You know I need you to be strong
And the day it as dark as the night is long
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, light my way (Alright now)
Baby, baby, baby, light my way
[Verse 2]
You bury your treasure
Where it can't be found
But your love is like a secret
That's been passed around
There is a silence that comes to a house
Where no one can sleep
I guess it's the price of love
I know it's not cheap
[Chorus]
Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way
Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
Baby, baby, baby,
light my way
[Verse 3]
I remember
When we could sleep on stones
Now we lie together
In whispers and moans
When I was all messed up
And I heard opera in my head
Your love was a light bulb
Hanging over my bed
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, light my way (Oh, come on)
Baby, baby, baby, light my way
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, light my way, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, light my way
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, light my way
Baby, baby, baby, light my way
