[Verse 1]
I'm ready
I'm ready for the laughing gas
I'm
ready
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready to duck
I'm ready to dive
I'm ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
I'm ready for the push, uh huh
[Pre-Chorus]
In the cool of the night
In the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling around
On my hands and knees
[Chorus]
She's just down the line (Zoo Station)
Got to make it on time (Zoo Station)
[Verse 2]
I'm ready
I'm ready for the gridlock
I'm ready
To take it to the street
I'm ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go
Of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush
[Chorus]
She's just down the line (Zoo Station)
Got to make it on time (Zoo Station)
[Bridge]
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby
It's alright
It's alright
[Pre-Chorus]
Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass
[Chorus]
I'm just down the line from your love (Zoo Station)
Under the sign of your love (Zoo Station)
I'm gonna make it on time, make it on time (Zoo Station)
I'm gonna be there (Zoo Station)
It's alright (Zoo Station)
Just two stops down the line (Zoo Station)
Just a stop down the line
[Verse 1]
I'm ready
I'm ready for the laughing gas
I'm
ready
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready to duck
I'm ready to dive
I'm ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
I'm ready for the push, uh huh
[Pre-Chorus]
In the cool of the night
In the warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling around
On my hands and knees
[Chorus]
She's just down the line (Zoo Station)
Got to make it on time (Zoo Station)
[Verse 2]
I'm ready
I'm ready for the gridlock
I'm ready
To take it to the street
I'm ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go
Of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush
[Chorus]
She's just down the line (Zoo Station)
Got to make it on time (Zoo Station)
[Bridge]
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby
It's alright
It's alright
[Pre-Chorus]
Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass
[Chorus]
I'm just down the line from your love (Zoo Station)
Under the sign of your love (Zoo Station)
I'm gonna make it on time, make it on time (Zoo Station)
I'm gonna be there (Zoo Station)
It's alright (Zoo Station)
Just two stops down the line (Zoo Station)
Just a stop down the line
