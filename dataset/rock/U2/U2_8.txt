[Verse 1]
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls that hold me inside
I wanna reach out and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name
(Ah, ah, ah)
[Verse 2]
I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name, yeah (Oh, huh)
[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
[Verse 3]
The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
I'll show you a place high on a
desert plain
(Yeah)
Where the streets have no name (Ah, ha)
[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
[Outro]
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh, and I see love
See our love turn to rust
Ah, we're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh, when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
[Verse 1]
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls that hold me inside
I wanna reach out and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name
(Ah, ah, ah)
[Verse 2]
I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name, yeah (Oh, huh)
[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
[Verse 3]
The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
I'll show you a place high on a
desert plain
(Yeah)
Where the streets have no name (Ah, ha)
[Chorus]
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
[Outro]
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh, and I see love
See our love turn to rust
Ah, we're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh, when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
