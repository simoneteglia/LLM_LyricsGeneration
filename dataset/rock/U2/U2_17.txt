[Verse 1]
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold
[Chorus]
But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
[Verse 2]
You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night
[Verse 3]
You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
[Chorus]
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
[Verse 4]
You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
[Verse 5]
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
[Chorus]
All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
[Outro]
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You
[Verse 1]
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold
[Chorus]
But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
[Verse 2]
You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night
[Verse 3]
You say you'll give me
Eyes in the moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
[Chorus]
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
[Verse 4]
You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last with me through the night
[Verse 5]
You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
[Chorus]
All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
[Outro]
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You
