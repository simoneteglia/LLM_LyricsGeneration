[Verse 1]
High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse, you elevate my soul
[Chorus]
I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down,
excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
[Verse 2]
A star, lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation
[Chorus]
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Now going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
[Bridge]
Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you
[Chorus]
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
[Outro]
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
[Verse 1]
High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse, you elevate my soul
[Chorus]
I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down,
excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
[Verse 2]
A star, lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing but I've got soul
The goal is elevation
[Chorus]
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Now going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
[Bridge]
Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you
[Chorus]
A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation
[Outro]
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
Elevation...
