[Verse 1]
Baby's crying 'cause it's born to sing
Singers cry about everything
Still in the playground falling off a swing
But you know that I know
[Verse 2]
Walk through the room like a birthday cake
When I am all lit up, I can't make a mistake
And there's a level of shallow that you just can't fake
But you know that I know
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you don't care
But you know I'm there
[Chorus]
You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
Look so good
That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
[Post-Chorus]
You know you're chasing the sunlight
That's why I'm stayin' up all night
[Chorus]
You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
A little more
[Verse 3]
It is what it is but it's not what it seems
This screwed up stuff is the stuff of dreams
I got just enough low self-esteem
To get me where I wanna go, oh
[Verse 4]
The showman gives you front row to his heart
The showman prays his heartache will chart
Making a spectacle of falling apart
Is just the start of the show, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you don't care
But you know I'm there
[Chorus]
You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
Look so good
That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
[Post-Chorus]
I'll be chasing the sunlight
That's why I'm staying up all night
I lie for a living, I love to let on
But you make it true when you sing along
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
Look so good
That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
You think you look so good
A little more better
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
Look so good
That's what's gonna get you
Look so good
Just a little more, little more
[Verse 1]
