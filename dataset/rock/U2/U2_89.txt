[Verse 1]
Right, right at the start
You put this into words
How you think we should proceed
Yeah
[Verse 2]
You wanted me alone
With the pictures that you've seen
Of where you haven't been
But where you wanna go
[Pre-Chorus]
Ask the leaf and ask the bird
Not to sing or speak a word
We are not fictitious characters
We don't belong to this world
[Chorus]
The book
The book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
In the book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in
The book of your heart
[Verse 3]
You can change your name
Or even who you are
That's the beauty of the scar
That is the contract of the heart
[Pre-Chorus]
This is our wedding day
This is the promise that we'll stay
Through the long descriptive passages
Where we don't know what to say
[Chorus]
The book
The book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
The book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in
The book of your heart
[Outro]
Babe, I don't belong to you
Love is what we choose to do
Babe, you don't belong to me
It's not that easy
[Verse 1]
Right, right at the start
You put this into words
How you think we should proceed
Yeah
[Verse 2]
You wanted me alone
With the pictures that you've seen
Of where you haven't been
But where you wanna go
[Pre-Chorus]
Ask the leaf and ask the bird
Not to sing or speak a word
We are not fictitious characters
We don't belong to this world
[Chorus]
The book
The book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
In the book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in
The book of your heart
[Verse 3]
You can change your name
Or even who you are
That's the beauty of the scar
That is the contract of the heart
[Pre-Chorus]
This is our wedding day
This is the promise that we'll stay
Through the long descriptive passages
Where we don't know what to say
[Chorus]
The book
The book of your heart
One tiny mark, an entry
The book of your heart
It's written on skin
To even be in
The book of your heart
[Outro]
Babe, I don't belong to you
Love is what we choose to do
Babe, you don't belong to me
It's not that easy
