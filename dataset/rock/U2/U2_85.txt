[Verse 1]
It was a cold and wet December day
When we touched the ground at JFK
The snow was melting on the ground
On BLS I heard the sound
Of an angel
New York like a Christmas tree
Tonight this city belongs to me
Angel
[Chorus]
Soul love
Well, this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem
[Verse 2]
Birdland on Fifty-Three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and
A Love Supreme
Miles says she's got to be an angel
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies
Angel
[Chorus]
Soul love
Well, this love won't let me go
So long
Angel of Harlem
Angel of Harlem, yeah
[Bridge]
She says it's heart, heart and soul
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, right now
[Verse 3]
Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
Empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee-sting
Blinded, you lost your way
In the side streets and the alleyways
Like a star exploding in the night
Falling to the city in broad daylight
[Chorus]
Angel in devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah, yeah
Angel of Harlem
[Outro]
Angel, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem
Angel, angel of Harlem
(Alright, that's alright, that's alright)
(Angel of Harlem)
