Verse
1]
Come all you stars falling out of the sky
Come all you angels forgetting to fly
Come all who feel we're not on our own
All UFOs come on your way home
Alone, that's no way to be carrying on
Come on, we're betting on a future that's long
Gone, in look of a song
You just have to be right one more time then you're wrong
[Refrain]
Atomic City (Atomic)
Oh, oh
Atomic City (Atomic)
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
I'm free
Where you are is where I'll be
I'm free
So unexpectedly
[Verse 2]
Come all who serve above and below
Come all believers and all who don't know
Come quick, come soon,
comme ci, comme ça
Then you dive into your eyes and blah blah blah
Guitars, she pulls th
e strings et cetera
Sinatra swings
, a choir sings
Love is god and god is love
And if your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough
[Refrain]
Atomic City (Atomic)
Oh, oh
Atomic City
Atomic Sun for everyone
For everyone
[Bridge]
Roll the dice
That's roulette
The beat has not stopped
Speeding yet
[Chorus]
I'm free
Where you are is where I'll be
I'm free
So unexpectedly
[Outro]
I'm free
I see what's in front of me
And your freedom is contagious
What you've got I wanna be
I'm free
It took me my whole life
I got the keys to the cages
I'm ready for bright lights
I'm free
I came here for the fight
I'm front row in Las Vegas
And there's a big one on tonight
