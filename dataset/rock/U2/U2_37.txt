[Intro]
And love is not the easy thing
The only baggage that you can bring
Love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind
[Verse 1]
And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
And for a second you turn back
Oh no, be strong
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, walk on, walk on
What you got they can't steal it
No, they can't even feel it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight
[Verse 2]
You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been
A place that has to be believed to be seen
You could have flown away
A singing bird in an open cage
Who will only fly, only fly for freedom
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, walk on, walk on
What you've got they can't deny it
Can't sell it or buy it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight
And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on
Walk on
[Bridge]
Home, hard to know what it is if you've never had one
Home, I can't say where it is but I know I'm going home
That's where the heart is
[Chorus]
And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
And you can only take so much
Walk on (Ooh)
Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind
[Outro]
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you feel
All this you can leave behind
All that you reason
All that you care
It's only time
And I'll never fill up all my mind
All that you sense
All that you speak
All you dress up
And all that you scheme
All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate
[Intro]
And love is not the easy thing
The only baggage that you can bring
Love is not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind
[Verse 1]
And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
And for a second you turn back
Oh no, be strong
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, walk on, walk on
What you got they can't steal it
No, they can't even feel it
Walk on, walk on
Stay safe tonight

You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been
A place that has to be believed to be seen

Oh, oh, walk on, walk on
What you've got they can't deny it
Can't sell it or buy it
Walk on, walk on

And you can only take so much
Walk on
Walk on
[Bridge]
Home, hard to know what it is if you've never had one
