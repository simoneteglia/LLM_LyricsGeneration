[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Desert sky, dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run, but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose, dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren she calls to me
[Chorus]
Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Set me alight, we'll punch a hole right through the night
Every day the dreamers die to see what's on the other side
She is liberty, and she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold
[Chorus]
Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country
Yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Naked flame, she stands with naked flame
I stand with sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love
Love, love
[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Desert sky, dream beneath the desert sky
The rivers run, but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose, dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren she calls to me
[Chorus]
Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Set me alight, we'll punch a hole right through the night
Every day the dreamers die to see what's on the other side
She is liberty, and she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold
[Chorus]
Sleep comes like a drug in God's country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses, in God's country
Yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Naked flame, she stands with naked flame
I stand with sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love
Love, love
