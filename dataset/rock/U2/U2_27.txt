[Verse 1]
Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
You've been living underground, eating from a can
You've been running away from what you don't understand, love
[Pre-Chorus]
She's slippy, you're sliding down
She'll be there when you hit the ground
[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
[Verse 2]
Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you wanna kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy
[Pre-Chorus]
She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child, yeah
[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, yeah
It's alright, it's alright, alright
Lift my days, light up my nights
, oh
[Bridge]
One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling
[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
[Outro]
Love (It's alright, it's alright, alright)
Oh love, love love
Oh, oh (We move through miracle days)
Oh love love
Move you (It's alright, it's alright, alright)
Spirits move
Let it move (
Spirit moves in mysterious ways
)
Does it move you?
Oh, ah
Does it move you? (It's alright, it's alright, alright)
She moves me
Lift my days, light up my nights, oh
[Verse 1]
Johnny, take a walk with your sister the moon

[Pre-Chorus]

She'll be there when you hit the ground
[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh

Oh love, love love
Oh, oh (We move through miracle days)

Does it move you?
Oh, ah
Does it move you? (It's alright, it's alright, alright)
She moves me
Lift my days, light up my nights, oh
