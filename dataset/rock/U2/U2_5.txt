[Verse 1]
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come, he to justify
One man to overthrow
[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
[Verse 2]
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man, he resist
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss
[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
[Instrumental Break 01:40-02:26]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Early morning, April four
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride
[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
[Instrumental Outro w/ Vocal Harmonies]
[Verse 1]
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come, he to justify
One man to overthrow
[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
[Verse 2]
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man, he resist
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss
[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love

Early morning, April four
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky

In the name of love
What more in the name of love
In the name of love
What more in the name of love
