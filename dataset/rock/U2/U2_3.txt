[Verse 1]
I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
[Verse 2]
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
[Verse 3]
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
I believe in Kingdom Come
Then all the colours bleed into one
Bleed into one
But, yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds
And loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
[Outro]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
[Verse 1]
I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
[Verse 2]
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
[Verse 3]
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
I believe in Kingdom Come
Then all the colours bleed into one
Bleed into one
But, yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds
And loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
[Outro]
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
