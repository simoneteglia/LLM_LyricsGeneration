[Verse 1]
How does he do it? How do they do it? Uncanny and immutable
This is such a happening tailpipe of a party
Like sugar, the guests are so refined
A confidence man, but why so beleaguered?
He's not a leader, he's a Texas leaguer
Swinging for the fence, got lucky with a strike
Drilling for fear, makes the job simple
Born on third, thinks he got a triple
[Pre-Chorus]
Blackout weaves its way through the cities
Blackout weaves its way through the cities
Blackout weaves its way
[Chorus]
I remember when you sang
That song about today
Now it's tomorrow and
Everything has changed
[Verse 2]
A think tank of aloof multiplication
A nicotine wish and a Columbus decanter
Retrenchment and hoggishness
The aristocrat choir sings "What's the ruckus?"
The haves have not a clue
The immenseness of suffering and the odd negotiation, a rarity
With onionskin plausibility of life
And a keyboard reaffirmation
[Pre-Chorus]
Blackout weaves its way through the cities
Blackout weaves its way through the cities
Blackout weaves its way
[Chorus]
I remember when you sang
That song about today
Now it's tomorrow and
Everything has changed
I remember when you sang
That song about today
Now it's tomorrow and
Everything has changed
[Outro]
Changed, changed... (changed, changed, changed)
