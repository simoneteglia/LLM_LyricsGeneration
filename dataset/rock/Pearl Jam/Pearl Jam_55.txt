[Verse 1]
I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules
I undeciphered tricks at the bar
But now you're gone, I haven't figured out why
I've come up with riddles and jokes about war
I've figured out numbers and what they're for
I've understood feelings and I've understood words
But how could you be taken away?
[Chorus 1]
And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go
It don't seem fair
Today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now
Reflected from afar
We were but stones
Your light made us stars
[Verse 2]
With heavy breath, awakened regrets
Back pages and days alone that could have been spent
Together, but we were miles apart
Every inch between us becomes light years now
No time to be void or save up on life
Oh, you got to spend it all
[Chorus 2]
And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go
It don't seem fair
You seemed to like it here
Your light's reflected now
Reflected from afar
We were but stones
Your light made us stars
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus 1]
And wherever you've gone
And wherever we might go
It don't seem fair
Today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now
Reflected from afar
We were but stones
Your light made us stars
