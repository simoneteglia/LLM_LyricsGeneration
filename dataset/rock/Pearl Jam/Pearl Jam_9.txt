[Verse 1]
I seem to recognize your face
Haunting familiar, yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
[Pre-Chorus]
All these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me
[Chorus]
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
[Verse 2]
I swear I recognize your breath
Memories, like fingerprints, are slowly raising
Me you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
[Bridge]
I just want to scream, "Hello
My god, it's been so long, never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are, and here I am"
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
[Chorus]
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they
fade...
