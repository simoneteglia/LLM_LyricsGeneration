[Verse 1]
He won the lottery when he was born
Took his mother's white breast to his tongue
Trained like dogs, color and smell
Walks by me to get to him
Police man
Police man
(All my pieces)
(All my pieces)
[Verse 2]
He won the lottery by being born
Big hand slapped the
white male American
[Pre-Chorus]
Do no wrong, so clean cut
Dirty his hands, it comes right off
Police man
Police man
[Chorus]
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man
Police man
[Bridge]
Jesus greets me, looks just like me
[Pre-Chorus]
Do no wrong, so clean cut
Dirty his hands, it comes right off
Police man, police man
Police man
[Chorus]
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man, police man
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police stopped my brother again
Police man, police man
Police man
[Break]
Hey-um, hey-um, hey-um
Hey-um, hey-um, hey-um
Hey-um, hey-um, hey-um
Hey-um, hey-um, hey-um
[Outro]
(All my pieces set me free) all my pieces set me free
(All my pieces set me free) all my pieces set me free
(Human devices set me free) human devices set me free
(All my pieces set me free) all my pieces set me free
(Human devices set me free) human devices set me free
