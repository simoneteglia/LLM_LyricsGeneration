[Verse 1]
Can't know what's high
Until you been down so low
The future's bright
Lit up with no where to go
[Chorus]
To and fro the pendulum throws
[Verse 2]
We are here and then we go
My shadow left me long ago
Understand what we don't know
This might pass, this might last, this may grow
Easy come easy go
Easy left me a long time ago
I'm in the fire, but I'm still cold
Nothing works, works for me anymore
[Chorus]
To and fro the pendulum throws
[Outro]
To and fro
To and fro
