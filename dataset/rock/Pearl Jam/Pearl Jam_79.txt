[Verse 1]
It's not all been said, been said and done
I've never slept in Satan's bed
Although I must admit, still visits my place
Uninvited, as you know he don't wait
[Verse 2]
Funny how he always seems to fit in
Funny how I always want to give in
Sundays, Fridays, Tuesdays, Thursdays the same
Sometimes this special guest he don't like to leave
[Chorus]
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already
[Verse 3]
Who made, who made up, made up the myth
That we were born to be covered in bliss?
Who set the standard? Born to be rich
Such fine examples, skinny little bitch
[Verse 4]
Model, role model, roll some models in blood
Get some flesh to stick so they look like us
I shit and I stink, I'm real, join the club
I'd stop and talk but I'm already in love
[Chorus]
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already (in love)
[Bridge]
Torture follows reward
Follows torture
Follows reward
Oh my word
[Verse 5]
Never shook Satan's hand, look, see for yourself
You'd know it if I had, that shit don't come off
I'll rise and fall, let me take credit for both
Jump off a cliff don't need your help so back off
[Verse 6]
I'll never suck Satan's dick
Again you'd see it, you know, right round the lips
I'll wait for an angel but I won't hold my breath
Imagine they're busy, think I'm doing okay
[Chorus]
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
Already in love
