[Verse 1]
State of love and trust as I busted down the pretext
Sin still plays and preaches, but to have an empty court, uh huh
And the signs are passin', grip the wheel, can't read it
Sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands, hands, yeah
[Chorus]
And I listen for the voice inside my head
Nothin', I'll do this one myself
[Verse 2]
Lay her down as priest does, should the Lord be accountin'
Will be in my honor, make it pain, painfully quick, uh huh
Promises are whispered in the age of darkness
Want to be enlightened like I want to be told the end, end, yeah
[Chorus]
And the barrel shakes aimed a directly at my head
Oh, help me, help me from myself
And I listen from both sides of a friend
Nothin', I'll do this one myself
Myself, myself
[Bridge]
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Hey, na na na na, hey that's something
Wanna back, back it away, yeah
[Chorus]
And I listen, yeah, for the voice inside my head
Nothin', I'll do this one myself
Oh, ah, and the barrel waits, trigger shakes
Aimed right at my head, won't you help me
Help me from myself
[Outro]
Mm, state of love and trust
In a state of love and trust
In a state of love and trust
In a state of love and, yeah, yeah
