[Verse 1]
Spin me round
Roll me over
Fucking circus
Stab it down
One way needle
Pulled so slowly
[Verse 2]
Drains and spills
Soaks the pages
Fills their sponges
[Chorus]
It's my blood
It's my blood
[Bridge]
Paint Ed big
Turn Ed into
One of his enemies
[Chorus]
It's my blood
It's my blood
It's my blood
[Outro]
Stab it down
Fill the pages
Suck my life out
Maker of my enemies
Take
My
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!
