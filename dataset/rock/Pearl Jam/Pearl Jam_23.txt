[Verse 1]
Once divided, nothing left to subtract
Some words when spoken can't be taken back
Walks on his own with thoughts he can't help thinking
Future's above, but in the past he's slow and sinking
[Pre-Chorus]
Caught a bolt of lightning
Cursed the day he let it go
[Chorus]
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something, nothingman
[Verse 2]
She once believed in every story he had to tell
One day she stiffened, took the other side
Empty stares from each corner of a shared prison cell
One just escapes, one's left inside the well
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And he who forgets
Will be destined to remember, oh, oh, ohh
[Chorus]
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something, nothingman
[Bridge]
Ooh, she don't want him (she don't want him)
Oh, she won't feed him after he's flown away
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Oh, into the sun
Ah, into the sun
Burn (burn), burn, burn
[Chorus]
Nothingman
Nothingman
Isn't it something, nothingman
[Outro]
Nothingman
Nothingman
Coulda been something, nothingman
Uh, uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh oh
