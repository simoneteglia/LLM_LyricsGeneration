[Verse 1]
Restless soul, enjoy your youth
Like Muhammad hits the truth
Can't escape from the common rule
If you hate something, don't you do it too (too)
[Verse 2]
Small, my table, sits just two
Got so crowded, I can't make room
Oh, where did they come from? Stormed my room!
And you dare say it belongs to you, to you
[Chorus 1]
This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you, not you
[Bridge]
Scream, my friends don't call me
Friends, no, they don't scream
My friends don't call, my friends don't
[Verse 3]
All that's sacred comes from youth
Dedication, na√Øve and true
With no power, nothing to do
I still remember, why don't you, don't you?
[Chorus 2]
This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, never was for you, fuck you
[Refrain]
This is not for you
Oh, this is not for you, yeah, you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you, oh, you
[Instrumental Outro]
