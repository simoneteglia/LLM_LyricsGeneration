[Verse 1]
I shut and locked the front door
No way in or out
I turned and walked the hallway
And pulled the curtains down
I knelt and emptied the mouth of every plug around
But nothing's sound, nothing's sound
[Verse 2]
I'd stay but my last cab left me
Ignored all my rounds
Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls
They were upside down
[Pre-Chorus]
I swallow my words to keep from lying
I swallow my face just to keep from biting, I, I
I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, diving
I surfaced when all of my being was enlightened
[Chorus]
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
[Verse 3]
It's been about three days now
Since I've been aground
No longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now
It's funny when things change so much
It's all state of mind
[Pre-Chorus]
I swallow my words to keep from lying
I swallow my face just to keep from biting, I, I
I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, diving
I surfaced when all of my being was enlightened
[Chorus]
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
