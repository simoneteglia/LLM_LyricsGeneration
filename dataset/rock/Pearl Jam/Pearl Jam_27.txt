[Verse 1]
Oh, please don't go out on me, don't go on me now
Never acted up before, don't go on me now
I swear I never took it for granted, just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you, just passing it on
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Go
Fuck
[Verse 2]
Once fastened, servile, now you're getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly with such disarm
I pulled the covers over him, should have pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis, a fool, not a fucking god
[Pre-Chorus 2]
No
Time
Suck
My
[Chorus 1]
Please, don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please... no, oh!
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Suck blood
Touch, please
Tunnel vision
Tuck, time
See
[Chorus 2]
Please, please, please
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please, don't you want me?
Don't go on me
Please, don't go on me
