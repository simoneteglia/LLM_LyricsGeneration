[Intro]
(She don't wander in here, don't wander in here, she)
(She don't wander in here, don't wander in here, she)
[Verse 1]
The direction of the eye, so misleading
The deflection of the soul, nauseously quick
I don't question our existence
I just question our modern needs
[Pre-Chorus]
(She don't wander in here, don't wander in here, she)
(She don't wander in here)
[Chorus]
I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face, blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone
[Verse 2]
After all is done and we're still alone
I won't be taken, yet
[Chorus]
I'll go with my hands bound
I will walk with my face, blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone
[Bridge]
I don't show, I don't share
I don't need, yeah, what you have to give
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face, blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of
[Outro]
I will walk with my hands, bound
I will walk, into your garden
Garden of stone!
I don't know, I don't care
I don't need you for me to live! Yeah yeah yeah
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh...
