[Verse 1]
All the photographs were peeling, and colors turned to gray
He stayed in his room with memories for days
He faced an undertow of futures laid to waste
Embraced by the loss of what he could not replace
[Pre-Chorus 1]
There is no reason that she passed
And there is no god with a plan
[Chorus]
It's sad, and his loneliness is proof
It's sad, he could only love you
It's sad
[Verse 2]
The door swings to a passing fable, a fate we may delay
We say, holding on, to live within our embrace
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Eleven nights, he laid in bed
Hoping that dreams would bring her back
[Chorus]
It's sad, and his loneliness is proof
It's sad, he could only love you
It's sad
[Bridge]
Holding his last breath
Believing he'll make his way, but she's not forgotten
He's haunted, he's searching for escape
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus 3]
If just one wish could bring her back
[Chorus]
It's sad, and his loneliness is proof
It's sad, he will always love you
It's sad
