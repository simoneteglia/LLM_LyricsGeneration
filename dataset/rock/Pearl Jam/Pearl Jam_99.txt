[Verse 1]
Wide awake and he shakes in a panic
Never woke up alone ever before
Had his woman long as he can remember
Tries to forget but he can't, he can't
Out of bed and he dreams in the shower
She's standing naked and apologizing
Reaches for her till his mind becomes blood hot
Woken up to be burned, burned again
[Chorus]
Go it alone
You got it so it goes
Gonna breathe and I said
"I can't take it any other way"
[Verse 2]
On the streets he's walking wounded
Doesn't smile for the child at play
Thoughts of suicide and alleviation
Anything to get his heart off of the coals
Does he fly away or just talk about it?
Like a seagull born to cry in the wind
Own experiences lead to a younger
All alone you will meet the one who lies in wait
[Chorus]
Go it alone
You got it so it goes
Try to breathe while you can
You can't take it any other way, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself, myself
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself, myself
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself don't talk to me
I can help myself, myself
[Outro]
Wide awake and he shakes in a panic
Never woke up alone ever before
Had his woman long as he can remember
Tries to forget but
He can't, he can't, he can't, he can't
I can help myself don't talk to me
