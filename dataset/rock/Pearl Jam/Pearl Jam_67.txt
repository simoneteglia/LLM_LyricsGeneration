[Verse 1]
Everyone's a critic looking back up the river
Every boat is leaking in this town
Everybody's thinking that they'll all be delivered
Sitting in a box like lost and found
But I found my place and it's alright
We all searching for our better way
Got yours off my plate, it's alright
I got my own way to believe
Find a lighthouse in the dark stormy weather
We all could use a sedative right now
Holy rollers sitting with their backs to the middle
All hands on deck, sinking is the bow
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And if you wanna have to pray, it's alright
We all be thinking with our different brains
Get yours off my plate, it's alright
I got my own way to believe
[Chorus 1]
It's ok
Sometimes you find yourself
Having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine, and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway
[Verse 2]
Science says we're making love like the lizards
Try and say that fossils ain't profound
Simon says that we are not allowed to consider
Simon says "Stand-up. Sit-down. You're out!"
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I found my place, and it's alright
Bearing witness to some stranger days
Get yours off my plate, it's alright
I got my own ways to believe
[Chorus 2]
It's ok
Sometimes you find yourself being told to change your ways
There's no way
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 1]
It's ok
Sometimes you find yourself
Having to put all your faith
In no faith
Mine is mine, and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway
[Chorus 3]
It's ok
Sometime you find yourself
Being told to change your ways
For Gods sake
Mine is mine and yours won't take its place
Now make your getaway
