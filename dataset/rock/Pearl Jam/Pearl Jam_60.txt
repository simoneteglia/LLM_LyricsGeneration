[Verse 1]
My lips are shaking, my nails are bit off
Been a month since I heard myself talk
All the advantage this life's got on me
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I fight back in my mind
Never lets me be right
I got memories, I got shit
So much it don't show
[Chorus 1]
I walked the line
When you held me in that night
I walked the line
When you held my hand that night
[Verse 2]
An empty shell seems so easy to crack
Got all these questions, don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream
Where I'm not ugly and you're looking at me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I'll stay in a bed
Oh, blue eyes, I've seen him
If just once, I could feel loved
Oh, stare back at me
[Chorus 1]
Lord, I walked the line
When you held me in that night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held my hand that night
[Chorus 2]
Oh, I walked the lie
When you held me close that night
I paid the price
Never held you in real life
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
My lips are shaking...
