[Verse 1]
Troubled souls unite
We got ourselves tonight
C'mon
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I am fuel, you are friends
We got the means to make amends
I am lost, I'm no guide
But I'm by your side
I am right by your side
[Verse 2]
Young lover I stand
It was their idea, I proved to be a man
Take my fucking hand
It was their idea, I proved to be a man
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Will myself to find a home
A home within myself
We will find a way
We will find our place
[Chorus]
Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta' my fuckin'...
Drop the leash, (face) drop the leash
Drop the leash, we are young
Drop the leash, we are young
Get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash
Get outta' my, my...
Drop the leash, drop the leash
[Outro]
Delight, delight, delight in our youth
(Ahhh)
Get outta' my fuckin' face
(Woah)
