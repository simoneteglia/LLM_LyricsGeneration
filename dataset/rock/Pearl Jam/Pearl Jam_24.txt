[Verse 1]
Vacate is the word, vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find the comfort in this world
Artificial tear, vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers?
Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere
[Chorus 1]
A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on
But there's a trapdoor in the sun
Immortality
[Verse 2]
As privileged as a whore, victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than thou (how?), surrendered, executed anyhow
Scrawl dissolved,
cigar box on the floor
[Chorus 2]
A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on to
But saw the trapdoor in the sun
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
Immortality
[Bridge]
Cannot stop the thought of running in the dark
Coming up a which way sign
All good truants must decide
[Verse 3]
Oh, stripped and sold mom, an auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink,
truants move on
Cannot stay long
Some die just to live
