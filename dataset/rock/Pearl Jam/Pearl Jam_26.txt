[Verse 1]
I will light the match this morning so I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent for soon night will be gone
Oh, I will stand arms outstretched, pretend I'm free to roam
Oh, I will make my way through one more day in hell
[Chorus]
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
[Verse 2]
I will hold the candle 'til it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep taking punches until their will grows tired
Oh, I will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction and I won't change my mind
[Chorus]
How much difference does it make?
Mmm how much difference does it make?
[Verse 3]
I'll swallow poison until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out 'til it fills this room
[Chorus]
How much difference
How much difference
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
[Outro]
(Ooh)
