[Verse 1]
I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off
I wish I was a sacrifice but somehow still lived on
I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on
The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top
[Hook 1]
I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds
For fifty million hands upraised and open toward the sky
[Verse 2]
I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me
I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me
[Hook 2]
I wish I was a messenger, and all the news was good
I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 3]
I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun
I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on
[Hook 3]
I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on
I wish I was the verb to trust and never let you down
[Outro]
I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up
I wish
[Fade out]
