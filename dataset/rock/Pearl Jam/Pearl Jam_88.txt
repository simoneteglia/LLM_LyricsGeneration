[Verse 1]
Here's a token of my openness
Of my need to not disappear
How I'm feeling, so revealing to me
I found my mind too clear
[Refrain]
I just need someone to be there for me
I just want someone to be there for me
[Verse 2]
All the static in my attic-a
Shoots down my sciatic nerve
To the ocean of my platitudes
Longitudes, latitudes, it's so absurd
[Refrain]
I just need someone to be there for...
I just want someone to be there for, someone to be there for me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference
I'm not trying to make a difference
I'll stop trying to make a difference
No way
I'll stop trying to make a difference
I'm not trying to make a difference
I'll stop trying to make a difference
No way
[Bridge]
Ooh, let's call in an angel
Ooh, let's call in an angel
Ooh, let's call in an angel
[Chorus]
'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference
I'm not trying to make a difference
I'll stop trying to make a difference
No way
'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference
I'm not trying to make a difference
I'll stop trying to make a difference
No way
[Outro]
No way
No way
Ooh, let's call in an angel
Ooh, let's call in an angel
