[Verse 1]
Lives opened and trashed "Look ma, watch me crash"
No time to question why'd nothing last
Grasp and hold on, we're dyin' fast
Soon be over and I will relent
[Chorus 1]
Let the ocean swell, dissolve 'way my past
Three days, and maybe longer
Won't even know I've left
[Verse 2]
Under your tongue, I'm like a tab
I will give you what you're not supposed to have
Under my breath, I swear by sin
For better or for worse, a-best we began
[Chorus 2]
Let the sun climb, oh, burn 'way my mask
Three days, and maybe longer
Shed my skin at last
Shed
Shed
[Chorus 3]
Let the sun shine, burn away my mask
Three days, and maybe longer
Won't ever find me here
[Chorus 4]
Let the ocean dissolve 'way my past
Four days, and not much longer
[Outro]
Let my spirit pass, ooh
This is, this is
This is, this is
This is, this is
My (last exit)
