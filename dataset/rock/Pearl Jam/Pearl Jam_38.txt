[Verse 1]
The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithin' and hopin' to buy themselves time
Me, I figure, as each breath goes by
I only own my mind
[Verse 2]
North is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in-between is mine
I am mine
[Chorus 1]
And the feeling, it gets left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
[Verse 3]
The ocean is full 'cause everyone's cryin'
The full moon is lookin' for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind
I am mine
[Chorus 2]
And the meaning that gets left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
Significant, behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
[Interlude]
Whoo!
[Chorus 3]
And the feelings that get left behind
All the innocents broken with lies
Significance between the lines
We may need to hide
[Chorus 4]
And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocents lost at one time
We're all different behind the eyes
There's no need to hide, yeah
