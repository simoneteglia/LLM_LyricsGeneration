[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey!
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
[Verse 1]
When something's dark, let me shed a little light on it
When something's cold, let me put a little fire on it
If something's old, I wanna put a bit of shine on it
When something's gone, I wanna fight to get it back again
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
When something's broke, I wanna put a bit of fixing on it
When something's bored, I wanna put a little exciting on it
If something's low, I wanna put a little high on it
When something's lost, I wanna fight to get it back again
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
When signals cross, I wanna put a little straight on it
If there's no love, I wanna try to love again
[Bridge]
I'll say your prayers, I'll take your side
I'll find us a way to make light
I'll dig your grave, we'll dance and sing
What's saved could be one last lifetime
[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey!
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
