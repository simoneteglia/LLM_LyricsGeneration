[Verse 1]
Oh, tonight began with anything
Shaft of light, a warm breath and a scream, ah, yeah
Oh, tamper if you like between the doors, oh yeah, uh, huh
Oh, can't expect to go out, to go out with anything, anything more
[Chorus]
Oh reach the door, a breath and a scr-
Oh reach the door, and a na na na na yeah
Life ain't what it's worth, a breath and a scr-
Oh reach the door
[Verse 2]
All these reaching hands out grabbing things, grabbing me
Day in, day out accumulating, ah yeah
Whoa, I suggest you step out on your porch, oh yeah, huh, huh, huh huh, yeah
Run away, my son, see it all. Oh, see the
world
[Chorus]
Oh reach the door, a breath and a scr-
Oh reach the door, and a na na na na yeah
Life ain't what it's worth, a breath and a scr-
Oh reach the door
[Bridge]
Come, here it comes, there it goes, when it comes, where it goes, where it comes
Can't see through the faith, woah
Ooh, come, here it comes, there it goes, grasp what you can
Don't you know there's something inside your head? yeah
[Outro]
Oh, if I knew where it was
I would take you there
But there's much more than
this
Ooh, whoa, much more than this
Oh, see the world
Much more than
Oh, much more than
Why?
