[Verse 1]
I'm going to save you fucker, not going to lose you
Feeling cocky and strong, can't let you go
Too important to me
Too important to us, we'd be lost without you
Baby, let yourself fall, I'm right below you now
[Chorus 1]
And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear, fuck me
And fuck if you only hear what you want to hear
Fuck me if I care, but I'm not leaving here
[Verse 2]
You helped me when I was down, I'll help when you're down
Why are you hitting yourself, come on hit me instead
Let's pick up your will, it's grown fat and lazy
I'm sympathetic as well,
don't go on me now
[Chorus 2]
And I'm not living this life without you, I'm selfish and clear
And you're not leaving here without me, I don't want to be without
My best friend, wake up to see you could have it all, all
[Verse 3]
Because there is but you, and something within you
It's taken control, let's beat it, get up, let's go
Oh, you're in your own world, let's see the whole world
Let's pick up your soul
[Chorus 3]
And fuck me if I say something you don't want to hear, fuck me, fuck me
And fuck me if you only hear the treble in your head
Please help me to help you help yourself
[Outro]
Help me help yourself
Please want me to, please let me to
Help you
