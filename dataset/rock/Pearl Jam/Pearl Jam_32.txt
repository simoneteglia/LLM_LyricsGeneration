[Verse 1]
On the edge, a windowsill
Ponders his maker, ponders his will
To the street below, he just ain't nothing
But he's got a great view
And he sinks the needle deep, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, can't touch the bottom
In too deep, yeah
Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom
[Verse 2]
Oh, on the edge of a know-nothing town
Feeling quite superior, the age had come
To the sky above, he just ain't nothing
But he's got a great view
And he sinks the burning knife deep, yeah
[Chorus]
Can't touch the bottom
In too deep, yeah
Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom
In too deep
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Bridge]
On the edge of a Christmas-clean love
Young virgin down from heaven visiting hell
To the man above her, she just ain't nothing
And she doesn't like the view, she doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view, but he sinks himself deep
[Chorus]
Oh, can't touch the bottom
In too deep, yeah
Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom
Can't touch the bottom, deep, yeah
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, the bottom (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (yeah)
Oh-oh
