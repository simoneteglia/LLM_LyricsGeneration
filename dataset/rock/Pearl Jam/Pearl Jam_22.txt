[Verse 1]
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards you
Know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
[Hook 1]
Of the next time we touch, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
You don't have to stray
Though oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
[Hook 2]
I will be, I will be there once more, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
