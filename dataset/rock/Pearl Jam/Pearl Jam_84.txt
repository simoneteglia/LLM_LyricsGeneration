[Verse]
Large fingers pushing paint
You're God and you've got big hands
Colors blend
The challenges you give man
Seek my part, devote myself
My small self
Like a book amongst the many on a shelf
Sometimes I know, sometimes I rise
Sometimes I fall, sometimes I don't
Sometimes I cringe, sometimes I live
Sometimes I walk, sometimes I kneel
Sometimes I speak of nothing at all
Sometimes I reach to myself, hear God
