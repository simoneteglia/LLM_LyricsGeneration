[Verse 1]
You got me through these feelings
That separate me from you
I put myself through a beating
I need you to pull me through
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll break through these feelings
I'll break through the ceiling
[Chorus]
I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you
I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you
[Verse 2]
Now's the time to resurface
Take back me and you
The hammer will fall on purpose
Our time, our truth
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll break through these feelings
I'll break through the ceiling
[Chorus]
I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you
I always take the long way
The long way
I always take the long way
That leads me back to you
[Outro]
Plant a seed in your mind
What's yours is mine
Show me how to live divine
What's yours is mine
Back to a moment in your mind
Go back in time
Show me how to live divine
What's yours is mine
