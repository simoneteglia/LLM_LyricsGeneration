[Verse 1]
Winded is the sailor
Drifting by the storm
Wounded is the organ
He left all bloodied on the shore
[Verse 2]
Gorgeous was his savior
Sees her drowning in his wake
Daily tastes the salt of her tears
But a chance blamed fate
[Chorus]
Little secrets, tremors
Turned to quake
The smallest oceans still get
Big, big waves
[Verse 2]
Ransom paid the devil
He whispers pleasing words
Triumphant are the angels
If they can get there first
[Chorus]
Little secrets, tremors
Turned to quake
The smallest oceans still get
Big big waves
[Bridge]
I'll decide, take the dive
Take my time, not my life
Wait for signs, believe in lies
To get by,
it's divine, whoa
You know what it's like?
[Outro]
Turns the bow back
Tows and drops the line
Puts his faith in love
And Tremor Christ
