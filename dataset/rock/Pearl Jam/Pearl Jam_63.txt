[Verse 1]
Don't feel like home, he's a little out
And all these words alone is nothing like your poem
Putting in and putting in don't feel like methadone
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone
[Chorus 1]
It's nothing as it seems, the little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees is nothing he concedes
It's home
[Verse 2]
One uninvited chromosome
, a blanket like the ozone
[Chorus 2]
It's nothing as it seems, all that he needs
It's home
The little that he frees is nothing he believes
[Verse 3]
Saving up a sunny day, something maybe two tone
Anything of his own, a chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding? Rainy day, a one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown, whisper through a megaphone
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus 1]
It's nothing as it seems, the little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees is nothing he concedes
It's home
[Outro]
And all that he frees, a little bittersweet
It's home
It's nothing as it seems, the little that you see
It's home
