[Verse 1]
The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here, and I'm a mess
I take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head
[Chorus 1]
I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run, but I can't walk
Guess I'll lie alone just like before
[Verse 2]
I'll take the varmint's path
Oh, and I must refuse your test
A-push me, and I will resist
This behavior's not unique
[Chorus 2]
I don't want to hear from those who know
They can buy but can't put on my clothes
I don't want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before
[Chorus 3]
I don't want to be held in your debt
I'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed
I'm already cut up and half dead
I'll end up alone like I began
[Bridge]
Everything has chains
Absolutely nothing's changed
Take my hand, not my picture
Spilled my tincture
[Chorus 4]
I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your breast
All the things that others want for me
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't be what you want because I...
[Verse 3]
Why ain't it supposed to be just fun?
Oh, to live and die, let it be done
I figure I'll be damned
All alone like I began
[Outro]
It's your move now
I thought you were a friend, but I guess I...
I guess I hate you
