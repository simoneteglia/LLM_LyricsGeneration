[Verse 1]
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness
Crashed and on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions; others walked away
A snowflake falls in may
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out
[Chorus]
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now
[Verse 2]
Nature has its own religion; gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend
And the sky breaks at dawn; shedding light upon this town
They'll all come around
[Chorus]
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now
[Verse 3]
And the road
The old man paved
The broken seams along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me
He was guiding me, love, his own way
[Chorus]
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
As the curtain comes down
I feel that this is just g'bye for now
