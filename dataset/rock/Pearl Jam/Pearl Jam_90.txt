[Verse 1]
Why deny all the troubles
When combined with the missing links
It don't feel like home now
That you're gone, all the trouble suddenly explained
Infinitum, you're always wishing and never here at home, you...
All the dreams we shared and lights we turned on
But the house is getting dark
And I don't want to know your past
But together, share the dawn
[Chorus 1]
And I won't need nothing else
'Cause when we're dead, we would have had it all
And died, I would've fallen from the sky to you
Parachutes have opened now
[Verse 2]
Heaven knows if there's a ceiling
Come so low with the kneeling
Please know that I got
All the friends I'm needing
Before my light goes out
As the doors are closing now
And far away will be my home
And to grasp this, I don't know
[Chorus 2]
But I don't need, further back and forth
A wave will break on me today
And love? Wish the world could go again with love
One can't seem to have enough
And war? Break the sky and tell me what it's for
I'll travel there on my own
And love? What a different life
Had I not found this love with you
