[Verse 1]
What the fuck is this world running to?
You didn't leave a message
At least I could have learned your voice one last time
Daily minefield, this could be my time by you
Would you hit me? Would you hit me?
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, aw
[Verse 2]
All the bills go by and initiatives are taken up
By the middle; there ain't gonna be any middle anymore
And the cross I'm bearing home ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch, left the porch
Oh, oh-oh
[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Hear my name, take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand, walk beside me
I just need to say
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Hear my name, take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand, lie beside me
I just need to say
[Outro]
I could not take, oh, just one day
I know when I would not ever
Touch you, hold you, feel you in my arms
Never again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
