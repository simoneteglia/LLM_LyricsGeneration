[Verse 1]
What were all those dreams we shared those many years ago?
What were all those plans we made now left beside the road?
Behind us in the road
"More than friends," I always pledged 'cause friends, they come and go
People change, as does everything, I wanted to grow old
I just want to grow old
[Chorus 1]
Slide up next to me, I'm just a human being
I will take the blame, but just the same, this is not me
You see? Believe
I'm better than this
Don't leave me so cold or buried beneath the stones
I just want to hold on and know I'm worth your love
Enough, I don't think
There's such a thing
[Verse 2]
It's my fault now, I been caught a sickness in my bones
How it pains to leave you here with the kids on your own
Just don't let me go
[Chorus 2]
Help me see myself, 'cause I can no longer tell
Lookin' out from the inside of the bottom of a well
It's hell, I yell
But no one hears
Before I disappear, whisper in my ear
Give me something to echo in my unknown future's ear
My dear, the end
Comes near, I'm here
But not much longer
