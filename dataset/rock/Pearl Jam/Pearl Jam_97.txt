[Chorus]
Lay down your arms and surrender to me
Oh lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yea
Use your arms for squeezing and pleasing the one that loves you so
[Verse 1]
Oh there ain't no reason for you to declare war on the one who loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield
[Chorus]
Lay down your arms and surrender to me
Oh lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yea
Use your arms for squeezing and pleasing the one that loves you so
[Verse 2]
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
But someday you're going to retreat
Cause my love baby is the truest you've ever had
I'm a soldier of love that's hard to beat
[Chorus]
Lay down your arms and surrender to me
Oh lay down your arms and love me peacefully. Yea
Use your arms for squeezing and pleasing the one that loves you so
[Outro]
Oh baby, lay down your arms. [x7]
Oh baby, lay down your arms
Oh baby, lay down your arms
Oh baby, lay down your arms
Oh baby, lay down your arms
Oh baby, lay down your arms
Oh baby, lay down your arms
Please baby lay down your arms
