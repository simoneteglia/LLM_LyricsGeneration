[Verse]
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make you smile?
When the sun don't shine, (It don't shine at all)
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make me smile? Yeah
When the sun don't shine
It don't shine at all, yeah
Don't it make me smile?
I miss you already
I miss you always
I miss you already, yeah
I miss you all day
This is how I feel
I miss you already, yeah
I miss you always
Three crooked hearts
Swirls all around, yeah
I miss you all day
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make you smile?
Three crooked hearts
Swirls all around
Don't it make you smile?
