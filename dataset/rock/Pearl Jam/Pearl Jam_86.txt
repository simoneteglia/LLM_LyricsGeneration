[Verse 1]
Oh please let it rain today
This city's so filthy, like my mind in ways
And oh, it was the time, like a clean new taste
Smiling eyes before me, inches from my face
[Chorus]
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
[Verse 2]
Sin for sale, buying just a need
Oh, who planted all the devils seeds?
And what's the truth, and the truth that lies at home?
It's on the inside and I can't get it off, yeah
[Chorus]
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
[Verse 3]
What's clean is pure, but hey, I'm white on the outside
Though I stray
What she don't know today might kill us both tomorrow
Bring it back someday
Bring it back, bring it back, back to, to the clean form, to the pure form
[Chorus]
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
