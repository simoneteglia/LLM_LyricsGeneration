[Verse 1]
Come to send, not condescend
Transcendent to consequences
To transcend where we are
Who are we? Who we are
[Verse 2]
Trampled moss on your souls
Changes, all you're a part
Seen it all, not at all
Can't defend fucked up men
[Hook 1]
Take me for a ride before we leave
[Verse 3]
Avalanche falling fast
A driving wind, happenstance
Off the track, in the mud
That's the moss in the aforementioned verse
[Bridge]
And a little... Wow... And a little...
[Hook 2]
Just a little time before we leave
[Verse 4]
Stop light plays its part
So I would say you've got a part
What's your part? Who you are
You are who, who you are
[Instrumental Outro]
