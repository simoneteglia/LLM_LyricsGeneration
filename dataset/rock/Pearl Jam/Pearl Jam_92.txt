[Verse 1]
I come from a genius and I am my father’s son
Yeah, too bad he was a psychopath and now I’m the next in line
Then there's dear mother, yeah surely she’s a work of art
Never got top dollar, but she gave us all our start
[Chorus 1]
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool drowning me
Can I beg a release?
I'm a volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fail
I call on DNA
Why such betrayal
Got me tooth and nail
[Verse 2]
Yeah, how’s about one conversation with nothing else left to be had
With this your young long lost son, and his never had dear old dad
I forget the insemination and for that I’m s’posed to be glad?
What a pity you left us so soon to climb your mountain of regret
[Chorus 2]
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool dark and deep
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fell
I called on DNA
Why such betrayal?
Oh I gotta set sail
[Bridge]
All real bright light shining as you’re trying to breathe in thin air
Cannot forget you’re hiding collected wounds left unhealed
When every thought you’re thinking sinks you darker than the new moon sky
The far away lights rising in the whites of your eyes
[Vese 3]
Now father you’re dead and gone and I’m finally free to be me
Thanks for all your fucked-up gifts for which I’ve got no sympathy
I’m living in a war torn place, hear the bombs, a 5th symphony
Thanks for this and thanks for that, I gotta let go legacy
[Chorus 3]
Can I get a reprieve?
This gene pool drowning me
Can I beg a release?
Can I volunteer amputee?
From the moment I fell
I called on DNA
Why such betrayal
Oh I gotta set sail
