[Verse 1]
Ah, is there room for both of us?
Both of us apart?
Are we bound out of obligation?
Is that all we've got?
I get the words and then I get to thinking
I don't want to think, I want to feel
And how do I feel?
And how do I
[Chorus]
If you're the only one
Will I never be enough? Yeah
Hail, hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah
[Verse 2]
Oh, I swear I'll love you until the day I die
Ah, and beyond
Are we going to the same place?
If so can I come?
It's egg rolling thick and heavy
All the past you carry
Oh, I could be new
You underestimate me
[Chorus]
If you're the only one
Will I never be enough? Yeah
Hail, hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah
[Bridge]
I sometimes realize
I could only be as good as you'll let me
Are you woman enough to be my man?
Bandaged hand in hand
[Outro]
I find it on the run
In a race that can't be won, yeah
All hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah
If you're my only one
So could you only one?
I want to be your one
Enough
Your one: your one...your one...
