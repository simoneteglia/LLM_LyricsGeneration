[Verse 1]
I felt the earth on Monday
It moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper
Laid out for me to see
Saw his face in a corner picture
I recognized the name
Could not stop staring at the
Face I'd never see again
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday in a hell man made
What can be saved, and who will be left to hold her?
[Chorus]
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
[Verse 2]
Medals on a wooden mantle
Next to a handsome face
That the president took for granted
Writing checks that others pay
And in all the madness
Thought becomes numb and na√Øve
So much to talk about, yeah
Nothing for to say
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's the same everyday, the wave won't break
Tell you to pray while the devil's on their shoulder
Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save
Does not equate and the truth's already out there
[Chorus]
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
[Bridge]
Looking in the eyes of the fallen
You got to know there's another
Another, another, another, another way
[Pre-Chorus 3]
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday and the wave won't break
Tell you to pray while the devil's on their shoulder
[Chorus]
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide
The whole world, world over
It's a world wide suicide, yeah
