[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:29]
[Verse]
Unsealed on a porch a letter sat
Then you said I wanna leave it again
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave it again, yeah
On a weekend wanna wish it all away
And they called and I said that I want what I said
And then I call out again
And the reason oughta leave her calm, I know
I said, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag
[Chorus]
Oh yeah, can you see them
Out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them
'Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know, I don't wanna stay
[Post-Chorus]
Make me cry
[Instrumental Break 01:49-02:37]
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I see
I don't know, there's something else
I wanna drum it all away
Oh, I said I don't,
I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag
[Chorus]
Oh yeah, can you see them
Out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them
'Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know, I don't wanna stay, oh
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay, oh, no
Yeah
[Outro]
Ohh, oh-oh-oh
Ohhh, oh-oh-oh
