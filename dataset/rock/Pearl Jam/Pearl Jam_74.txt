[Verse 1]
Who's got the brain of JFK?
What's it mean to us now?
Oh, it's sound insurance
But I can tell you, this is no lie
[Chorus]
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
[Verse 2]
You, you've been taught
Whipped into shape, now they got you in line
Stand behind the stripes
There will be order, so give it a good mind
[Chorus]
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
[Bridge]
And by name
The name they gave me
The name I'm letting go
[Chorus]
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
The whole world will be relieved
The whole world will be different soon
Soon...
