[Verse 1]
I admit it, what's to say?
I'll relive it, without pain
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hm, back-street lover on the side of the road
I gotta bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes
,
I play
[Chorus]
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah
[Verse 2]
Oh, try and mimic, what's insane
I am in it, where do I stand?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hm, Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a back street lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet, I pray
[Chorus]
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
You think I got my eyes closed
But I've been looking at you the whole fucking time
[Chorus]
Once upon a time I could control myself
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah
[Outro]
Once upon a time I could love myself, yeah
Once upon a time I could love you, yeah, yeah
Once! Once! Once! Once! Yeah
Once! Once! Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh once!
