[Verse 1]
She lived on the curve in the road
In an old tar paper shack
On the south side of the town
On the wrong side of the tracks
Sometimes on the way into town
We'd say, "Mama can we stop and give her a ride?"
Sometimes we did
But her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed crazy Mary
[Verse 2]
Down the long dirt road
Past the Parson's place
That old blue car
We used to race
Little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said 'NO L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G ALLOWED.'
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd
[Chorus]
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, drink it... pass it around, pass it a...
A-take a bottle drink it down, pass it... pass it a... pass it around
[Verse 3]
One night thunder cracked
Mercy backed outside my windowsill
Dreamed I was flying
High above the trees, over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb hung, newspaper covered walls
And Mary rising up above it all
Oh... oh... oh...
[Verse 4]
Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve
Through the fields
Into the house of Mary
[Pre-Chorus]
That what you fear the most could meet you halfway
That what you fear the most could meet you halfway
[Chorus]
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it... pass it around, pass it a...
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it... pass it a... pass it around
Oh, pass it a... pass it arround, pass it a... pass it a... pass it a...
Oh yeah
