[Verse 1]
I got blood
Blood on my hands
The stain of
Of a human
I finally awoke
To my mother's wrath
Call lights
Bed sores and sponge baths
[Pre-Chorus]
Firstly do no harm
Then put your seatbelt on
[Chorus]
Buckle up
Buckle up
[Verse 2]
The drapes pull back
Reveal her wound
Her boy on her lap
A murderer groomed
[Verse 3]
Antiquities lost
Lost to the Nile
A sudden slip
A fall on the tile
[Pre-Chorus]
Firstly do no harm
Then put your seatbelt on
[Chorus]
Buckle up
Buckle up
Buckle up
Buckle up
