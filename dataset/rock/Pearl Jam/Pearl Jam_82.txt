[Verse 1]
Up here in my tree, yeah
Newspapers matter not to me, yeah
No, no more crowbars to my head, yeah
I'm trading stories with the leaves instead, yeah
I wave to all my friends, yeah
They don't seem to notice me, no
All their eyes trained on the street, yo, oh
Sidewalks cigarettes and seams, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Up here so high, I start to shake
Up here so high, the sky I scrape
I'm so high I hold just one breath deep within my chest
Just like innocence
[Bridge]
(Eddie's down in his home)
(Oh, the blue sky, it's his home)
(Eddie's blue sky home)
(Oh, the blue sky, it's his home)
[Verse 2]
I remember when, yeah
I swore I knew everything, oh yeah
They say knowledge is a tree, yeah
It's growing up just like me, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm so light, the wind he shakes
I'm so high, the sky I scrape
Yeah, I'm so high I hold just one breath to go back to my nest
To sleep with innocence
Up here so high the boughs they break
Up here so high the sky I scrape
And my eyes feel both wide open
And I got a glimpse of my inner sense
Got back my innocence
Still got it, still got it
