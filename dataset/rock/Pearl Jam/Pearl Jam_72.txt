[Verse 1]
All the thoughts you never see, you are always thinking
Brain is wide, the brain is deep, oh, are you sinking?
Feel the path of every day, which road you taking?
Breathing hard, making hay, yeah, this is living
[Verse 2]
Look for love in evidence that you're worth keeping
Swallowed whole in negatives, it's so sad and sickening
Feel the air up above, oh, pool of blue sky
Fill the air up with love, all black with starlight
[Chorus 1]
Feel the sky blanket you with gems and rhinestones
See the path cut by the moon for you to walk on
For you to walk on
[Bridge]
Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing here
Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing left
Nothing left, nothing left, nothing there, nothing here
Not here
[Verse 3]
See the path cut by the moon for you to walk on
See the waves on distant shores awaiting your arrival
[Chorus 2]
Dream the dreams of other men, you'll be no one's rival
Dream the dreams of others, then you will be no one's rival
You will be no one's rival
[Outro]
A distant time, a distant space, that's where we're livin'
A distant time, a distant place, so what ya givin'?
What ya givin'?
