[Verse 1]
Clouds roll by
Reeling is what they say
Or is it just my way?
Wind blows by
[Chorus]
Low light
Side-tracked
Low light
Can't see my tracks, your scent-way back
[Verse 2]
Can I be here all alone?
Clear a path to my home
Blood runs dry
Books and jealousy tell me wrong
I will feel calm
Voice blows by
[Chorus]
Low light
Car crash
Low light
Can't wear my mask, your first, my last
[Solo]
[Verse 3]
Voice goes by
Two birds is what they'll see
Getting lost upon their way
Wind rolls by
[Chorus]
Low light
Eye sight
Low light
[Outro]
I need the light
I'll find my way from wrong, what's real?
The dream I see
