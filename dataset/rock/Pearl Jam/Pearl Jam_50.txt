[Verse 1]
She comes on like a stone
But you don't know where from she was thrown
Like a burning meteor from miles high
Looking for a place to land
She said, "Have you got yourself some sand?"
And whatever you replied, she took as yes
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now she comes after thee
With her newly planted seeds and soon
You're prone down on your knees and there you dig
And then before you know
The weeds are obesely overgrown
With all the wild seed she sows in your sleep
[Chorus]
You gotta know you'll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
[Verse 2]
Always something and never nothing
Isn't that the way we're taught to be? To be
Flipping through the worn out pages
And stages when you knew not who to be, yeah yeah
Till the lightning strike sets you free, yeah
[Chorus]
You gotta know you'll never let her go
She's a lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
Lightning bolt
[Bridge]
Crashing stormy waves erode her
Shoreline everyday until the
Castle of her ways turns to sand
She holds her lovely breast
As her birds fall from the nest
Flying towards the great northwest, yeah yeah yeah
And with no repair in sight
There is no God with such might
As to open her world wide with subterfuge
And your death will soon arrive
As she finally decides
That all her problems, they won't die with you
[Interlude]
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
Hey yeah
[Outro]
And when I let her go
I'm a lightning bolt
She's a lightning bolt
And when I let her go
She's true
She's a lightning bolt
Uncontrollable
Like you
