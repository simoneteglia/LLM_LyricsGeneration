[Verse 1]
I'm wishing you all well
Mind at peace within your cell
Covers up I cast you off
I'll be watching as you breathe
I lie still,
you move, I send
you off around the bend
[Verse 2]
I hold your head deep in my arms
My fingertips they close your eyes
Off you dream my little child
There's a sun around the bend
There's a sun around the bend
[Verse 3]
All evenings close like this
All these moments that I've missed
Please forgive me, won't you dear?
Please forgive and let me share with you around the bend
[Outro]
You're an angel when you sleep
How I want your soul to keep on, and on, around the bend
