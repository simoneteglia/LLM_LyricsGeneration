[Verse 1]
Outta my way, outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one, into not one
Into your step
but out of time
Headstrong, what's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
[Pre-Chorus]
You arrived
But now it's
time to kiss your ass goodbye
[Chorus]
Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch, ah!
Yeah, it ain't my bitch
Oh
[Verse 2]
Down on the sun, down and no fun
Down and out where the hell ya been?
Damn it all down, damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again
Stand tall, can't fall
Never even bend at all before
[Pre-Chorus]
You arrived
But now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
[Chorus]
Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless, yeah
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch, ah!
[Bridge]
Oh, outta my way!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Outta my way, outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one, into not one
Into your step but out of time
Headstrong, what's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
[Pre-Chorus]
You arrived
But now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
(And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye)
(And now it's time to kiss ass)
[Chorus]
Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless, yeah
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch, ah!
No way but down
Why you're around?
No foolin', yeah
It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch, oh, it ain't mine
[Bridge]
Ain't mine, your kind
You're steppin' out of time
Ain't mine, your kind
You're steppin' out of time
[Chorus]
Dragging me down
Why you around?
No foolin'
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my, ooh, bitch
[Outro]
You ain't mine
