[Verse 1]
Thunder and lightning, the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
[Chorus]
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
[Verse 2]
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Ironclad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
[Chorus]
Metal militia
Metal militia, oh!
[Guitar Solo]
[Instrumental Break]
Oh
!
[Verse 3]
We are as one; yes, we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, through the mist and the madness
We're trying to get the message to you
[Chorus]
Metal militia
Metal militia
[Outro]
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia
