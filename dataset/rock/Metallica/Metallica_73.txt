[Verse 1]
All that is, was, and will be
Universe, much too big to see
Time and space, never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitation of human understanding
Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
(Twisting, turning, through the never)
[Chorus]
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever, twisting, turning
Through the never
[Verse 2]
In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of
truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to
the breeze of the heavens
On a quest, meaning, reason
Come to be, how it begun
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
(Twisting, turning, through the never)
[Chorus]
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever, twisting, turning
Through the never
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
On through the never
We must go
On through the never
Out to the
Edge of forever
We must go
On through the never
Then never comes
[Pre-Chorus]
(Twisting, turning, through the never)
[Chorus]
All that is, ever, ever was
Will be ever, twisting, turning
Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning, through the never
[Outro]
Never
