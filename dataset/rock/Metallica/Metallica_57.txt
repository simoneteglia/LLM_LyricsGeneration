[Verse 1]
Obey, obey
Come won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears
Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed
[Chorus]
Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Allure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside
Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Obey, obey
Just don't turn away
[Chorus]
Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire
[Bridge]
Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender
Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection
[Bridge]
Too dark to sleep
Can't slip away
Open or close
My eyes betray
Beyond the black
Come won't you stay
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
[Guitar Solo]
