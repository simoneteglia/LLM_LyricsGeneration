[Verse 1]
There is a devil waiting outside your door (How much longer?)
There is a devil waiting outside your door (How much longer?)
And he is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor (How much longer?)
And he is howling with pain, crawling up the walls (How much longer?)
There is a devil waiting outside your door (How much longer?)
And he is weak with evil and broken by the world (How much longer?)
And he is shouting your name and asking for more (How much longer?)
There is a devil waiting outside your door (How much longer?)
[Pre-Chorus]
Loverman! Since the world began
Forever, amen, untill the end of time
Take off that dress
I'm coming down
I'm your loverman
Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
[Chorus]
L is for LOVE, baby
O is for ONLY you that I do
V is for loving VIRTUALLY everything that you are
E is for loving almost EVERYTHING that you do
R is for RAPE me
M is for MURDER me
A is for ANSWERING all of my prayers
N is for KNOWING your loverman is going to be the answer to all of yours
[Post-Chorus]
Loverman! Till the bitter end
While the empires burn down
Forever and ever and ever, ever, amen
I'm your loverman
So help me, baby
So help me, baby
Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
I'm your loverman
[Verse 2]
There is a devil crawling along your floor (How much longer?)
There is a devil crawling along your floor (How much longer?)
With a trembling heart, he is coming through your door (How much longer?)
With his straining sex in his jumping paw (How much longer?)
There is a devil crawling along your floor (How much longer?)
And he's old and he's stupid and he's hungry and he's sore
And he is blind and he's lame and he is dirty and he's poor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more, gimme more (How much longer?)
There is a devil crawling along your floor
[Pre-Chorus]
Loverman! Haha! And here I stand
Forever, amen
Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
Forgive me, baby
My hands are tied
And I got no choice, no, no,no,no
I got no choice, no choice at all
I will say it again
[Chorus]
L is for LOVE, baby
O is for OH yes I do
V is for VIRTUE, so I ain't going to hurt you
E is for EVEN if you want me to
R is for RENDER unto me, baby
M is for that which is MINE
A is for ANY old how, darling
N is for ANY old time
[Post-Chorus]
Loverman! Yeah, yeah, yeah! I got the masterplan
To take off your dress
And be your man, be your man
Seize the throne
Seize the mantle
Seize that crown
Because I am what I am what I am what I am plus I am
I'm your loverman
[Verse 3]
There's a devil laying by your side (How much longer?)
There's a devil laying by your side (How much longer?)
You might think he's asleep, but take a look at his eyes (How much longer?)
And he wants you, darling, to be his bride (How much longer?)
Yeah, there's a devil laying by your side (How much longer?)
[Outro]
Loverman! Loverman! Loverman!
I'll be your loverman
Till the end of the time
Till the empires burn down
Forever, amen
I'll be your loverman
I'll be your loverman
I'm your loverman
I'm your loverman
Yeah, I'm your loverman
I'm your loverman
Loverman
