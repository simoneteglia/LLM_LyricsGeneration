[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
(And the road becomes my bride)
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
[Pre-Chorus]
Roamer, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
[Verse 2]
(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one
And my ties are severed clean
The less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
[Pre-Chorus]
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
Yeah, you will
[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And Iâ€™ll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah-yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my time anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
[Post-Chorus]
Carved upon my stone
My body lies, but still I roam, yeah-yeah
[Outro]
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, yeah
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam
Yeah-yeah, wherever I may roam
Yeah-yeah, wherever I may roam
