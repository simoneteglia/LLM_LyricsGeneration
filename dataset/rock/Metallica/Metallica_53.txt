[Verse 1]
Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Not the word, not the love
Not what you thought from above
[Pre-Chorus]
It feeds (It feeds)
It grows (It grows)
It clouds all you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you believe
[Chorus]
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
[Verse 2]
Find your peace, find your say
Find the smooth road on your way
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave
[Pre-Chorus]
It feeds (It feeds)
It grows (It grows)
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you believe
[Chorus]
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I see faith in your eyes
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
[Verse 3]
Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave
[Chorus]
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
[Outro]
Follow the god that failed, yeah
Broken is the promise
Betrayal, betrayal, yeah
