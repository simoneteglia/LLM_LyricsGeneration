[Intro: Lars Ulrich]
One, two
One, two, three, four, one
[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Please, please, spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees, knees, falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will
[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah
[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Chain, chain, join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
, infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power
, we see
[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah
[Bridge: James Hetfield]
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie
