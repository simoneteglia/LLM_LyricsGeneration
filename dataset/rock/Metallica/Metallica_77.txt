[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you
I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here, I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground
[Chorus]
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you, revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
[Verse 2]
I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you
Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands that lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul
[Chorus]
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, just set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you, revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you, revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
[Post-Chorus]
Sweet revenge
[Instrumental Outro]
