[Verse 1]
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engine's moanin' out his one-note song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through
[Chorus]
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
[Verse 2]
So you walk into this restaurant, all strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: "Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Make your stand
[Chorus]
Ah, here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
[Verse 3]
Oh, out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try and give away
And the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
What she said
[Instrumental Break]
Yeah!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Yeah, here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on that stage
And here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page
[Outro]
There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go
There I go
And I'm gone
