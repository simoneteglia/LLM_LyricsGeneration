[Spoken Intro]
"Fuckin' coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Oh shit, oh fuck!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!"
[Instrumental Intro (0:19 - 1:46)]
[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
[Refrain]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me
[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
[Refrain]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, help me
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine, has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell
[Instrumental Outro]
[Guitar Solo]
