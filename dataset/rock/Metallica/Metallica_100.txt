[Last Caress]
[Verse 1]
I got somethin' to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead
[Verse 2]
I got somethin' to say
I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as she's spread
[Chorus]
Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress
Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress
[Verse 1]
I got somethin' to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead
[Chorus]
Ooh, lovely death is waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress
Last caress, sweet death
Yo
Yo
[Green Hell]
[Verse 3]
Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell
[Chorus]
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
[Verse 4]
We are going to burn in hell - Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green - Green hell
Try let me get back up there -
Green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal - Green hell
Throw your fucking friends inside - Green hell
Got to fucking pay and you must stay - Green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death - Green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood - Green hell
Got to burn it all, green hell
[Chorus]
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
[Chorus]
Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it, green hell
[Chorus]
You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from me
I bet you thought you really could
[Outro]
You have come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Going to bring green hell
Green hell
