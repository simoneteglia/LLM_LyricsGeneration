[Intro]
One, two
One, two
Luck runs out
[Verse 1]
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel and burn
Still life, incarnation
Still life, infamy
Hallucination
,
heresy
Still, you run, what's to come? What's to be?
[Chorus]
'Cause we
hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
[Post-Chorus]
Luck runs out
[Verse 2]
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life, immolation
Still life, infamy
Hallucination,
heresy
Still, you run, what's to come? What's to be?
[Chorus]
'Cause we
hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
[Bridge]
Then you crawl back in, into your obsession
Never to return, this is your confession
[Chorus]
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
[Outro]
Your luck runs out
