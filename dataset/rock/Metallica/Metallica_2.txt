[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
[Verse 4]
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 5]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
[Verse 6]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah, yeah
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 7]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters
[Instrumental Outro]
