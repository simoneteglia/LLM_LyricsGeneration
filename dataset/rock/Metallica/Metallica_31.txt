[Intro]
Don't tread on me
I said, "Don't tread on me"
[Verse 1]
Liberty or death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail
Never begins it
Never, but once engaged
Never surrenders
Showing the fangs of rage
I said, "Don't tread on me"
[Chorus]
So be it
, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore, hey
Don't tread on me
[Verse 2]
Love it or leave it
She with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue
Forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance
(
The eyes, they never close
)
Emblem of vigilance
Ooh, no, no, no
Said, "Don't tread on me"
[Chorus]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore
Don't tread on me
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
[Verse 3]
Liberty or death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail
[Chorus]
So be it, threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it, settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore
Don't tread on me
