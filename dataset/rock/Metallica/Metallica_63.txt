[Verse 1]
I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better
I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better
Woah
Woah, yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted
This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
Ooh, it tears me and I bleed, yeah
And I bleed, oh yeah, yeah
Yeah
[Chorus]
Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
, woah
Ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
Oh, the bleeding of me, yeah
Ooh, of me, yeah
The bleeding of me
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, woah
Ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Woah, the bleeding of me
[Bridge]
Yeah
I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under
[Chorus]
Caught under wheel's roll
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
Oh, I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
Oh, oh, the bleeding of me, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
Ooh, come on, baby
[Verse 3]
I'm, yeah
I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better
I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better
[Outro]
With something better
