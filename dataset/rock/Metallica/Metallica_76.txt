[Verse 1]
One crown
Shines on through the sound
One crown
Born to lose
One man
Does not give a damn
One man
No excuse
[Refrain]
Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces 'til you die
[Pre-Chorus]
White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on
[Chorus]
Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win
[Verse 2]
One fist
Hammers through the mist
One fist
Steady on
One heart
Diehard from the start
One heart
Beats its song
[Refrain]
Murder all
Murder one
Give me murder
Second class to none
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Headlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on
[Chorus]
Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
I still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse
[Outro]
'Til the end
Been living to win
Been living to win
