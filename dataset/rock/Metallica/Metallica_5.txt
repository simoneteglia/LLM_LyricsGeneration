[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time, the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow onto his own, that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah
[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
[Verse 2]
They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
That old man here is me, yeah
[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven, oh-woah
[Outro]
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
