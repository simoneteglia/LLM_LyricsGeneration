[Verse 1]
And it feels right this time
On this crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy
Says it feels right this time
Turned around and found the right line
"Good day to be alive, Sir
Good day to be alive," he said, yeah
[Chorus]
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way, yeah
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way, yeah
[Verse 2]
Don't it feel right like this?
All the pieces fall to his wish
"Suck up for that quick reward, boy
Suck up for that quick reward," they said
[Chorus]
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way, yeah
It's coming your way
It's coming your way, yeah yeah
Here it comes
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Yeah, then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Then it comes to be, yeah yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah yeah
Then it comes to be, yeah
[Outro]
Yeah
