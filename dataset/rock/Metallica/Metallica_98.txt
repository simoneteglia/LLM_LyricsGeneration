[Intro]
There's no light
[Verse 1]
Ooh, down and out as darkness falls
So much more than he can take
Oh, shakes the cage in deep withdrawals
Come on, give the boy a break
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, he will break
He's no mistake
[Chorus]
Chase that light, lean on me!
Face that fight, lean on me!
Catch your fall, lean on me!
End it all, lean on me!
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light
[Verse 2]
Ooh, lost his way through wicked streets
But he is someone's little boy
Oh, all the love a young one needs
Thoughtless еlders have destroyеd
[Pre-Chorus]
It is destroyed
He's just a boy
[Chorus]
Chase that light, lean on me!
Face that fight, lean on me!
Catch your fall, lean on me!
End it all, lean on me!
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light
[Bridge]
One step down
Block it all from view
One step down
With apathy, look straight through
One step down
Turn so you won't see
One step down
He's just like you and me
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Chase that light, lean on me!
Face that fight, lean on me!
Catch your fall, lean on me!
End it all, lean on me!
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light
[Outro]
There's no light
