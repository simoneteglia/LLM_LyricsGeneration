[Verse 1]
Anticipation
In domination
A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light
[Pre-Chorus]
Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing
[Chorus]
Lux æterna
Lux æterna, yeah
[Verse 2]
Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life
[Pre-Chorus]
Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing
[Chorus]
Lux æterna
Lux æterna, yeah
[Bridge]
Lux æterna
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Emancipation
Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike
Amplification
Lightning the nation
Never alive more than right here tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing
[Chorus]
Lux æterna
Lux ætеrna, yeah
[Outro]
Light it
