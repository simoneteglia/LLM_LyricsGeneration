[Intro]
Ah
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes
I will be seeing you again
I will be seeing you, in hell
[Chorus]
So don't cry to me oh baby
Your future is in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it coming on
Don't cry to me oh baby
Had to know it was in your card
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end soul for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me oh baby
And now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I will be seeing you again
I will be seeing you, in hell
[Chorus]
So don't cry to me oh baby
Your future is in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it coming on
Don't cry to me oh baby
Had to know it was in your card
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end soul for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me oh baby
And now your life drains on the floor
Don't cry to me oh baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I will be seeing you again
I will be seeing you, in hell
[Outro]
Die-die-die
Die-die-die
Die-die-die
Die
