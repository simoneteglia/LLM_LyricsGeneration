[Verse 1]
Sound starts ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of
leather
on your lips
[Chorus]
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall on to your knees for the phantom lord
[Verse 2]
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
[Chorus]
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall on to your knees for the phantom lord
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
The leathered armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising-volume metal sound
[Chorus]
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall on to your knees for the phantom lord
[Outro]
Fall to your knees
And bow to the phantom lord!
