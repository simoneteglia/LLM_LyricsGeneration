[Verse 1]
Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it, oh, so bad
[Chorus]
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!
[Verse 2]
Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
with your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight
[Chorus]
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!
[Verse 3]
Here on stage, the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
'Cause this is what we choose
[Chorus]
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
[Instrumental Break]
Here we go!
[Guitar Solo]
Whiplash!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again, we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica
[Chorus]
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
[Outro]
Whoa, whoa
