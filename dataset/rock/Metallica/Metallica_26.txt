[Verse 1]
My life suffocates, planting the seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate, trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take this life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
, you've turned this lie to truth
[Pre-Chorus]
Anger, misery you'll suffer unto me
[Chorus]
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
[Verse 2]
Pure black looking clear, my work is done soon here
Try getting back to me, get back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in, let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain,
your loss becomes my gain
[Pre-Chorus]
Anger, misery you'll suffer unto me
[Chorus]
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
All have said their prayers, invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes, you'll find where murder lies
Infanticide
[Chorus]
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
[Outro]
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
