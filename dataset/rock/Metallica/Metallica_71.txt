[Verse 1]
He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath
[Verse 2]
He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving Earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive
[Pre-Chorus]
And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all
[Chorus]
You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
[Post-Chorus]
Cthulhu, awaken
[Verse 3]
He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all
[Chorus]
You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
[Post-Chorus]
Cthulhu, awaken
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
[Bridge]
Sanity taken
Seething damnation
Cthulhu awaken
(Wake) Winged Salvation
Death by creation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
[Outro]
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
