[Verse 1]
I'll take it out of the wishing well! I'm thinking I have a plan!
Go on with your bad self! What do you see in yourself?!
You think you're losing, it's time to stop accusing
You're never gonna take a hit on the head!
Now, if you don't care, take a ride somewhere!
[Chorus]
Hey! It has something you want to try and buy yourself
Hey! It has something, it goes 'round and 'round again
Go! Go! You should've never wasted your lung!
Go! Go! And the ride was shared!
[Post-Chorus]
Go, Limo!
Go, Limo!
[Verse 2]
I guess you're stuck in the Habitrail, you gotta love this shit!
Way out on a back shelf, you'll never know what you did!
Look what you're doing, now Mama said it's ruined
You had a mollusk in the palm of your hand!
So, it's a bad smell! Your ass won't win!
[Chorus]
Hey! It has something you wanna try and buy yourself
Hey! It has something, it goes 'round and 'round and 'round again
Go! Go! You never have been away so long!
Go! Go! And the ride was shared!
Go! Go! Whatever happened to DayGlo thongs?!
Go! Go! And the ride was shared!
[Post-Chorus]
Go, Limo!
Go, Limo!
Yeah! Alright!
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro]
Whoa!
