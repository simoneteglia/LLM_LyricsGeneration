[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Oh mirror mirror, you're comin' in clear
I'm finally somewhere in between
I'm impressed, what a beautiful chest
I never meant to make a big scene
Will you resign to the latest design?
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams
One more for hire, a wonderful liar
I think it's time we all should come clean
[Pre-Chorus]
Stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards, all I want is the truth
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we won?
Hey, hey, now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blonde
[Verse 2]
God bless, what a sensitive mess
Yeah, but things aren't always what they seem
Your teary eyes, your famous disguise
Never knowin' who to believe
See through, yeah, but what do you do?
When you're just another agin' drag queen
[Pre-Chorus]
Stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards, all I want is the truth
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we won?
Hey, hey, now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blonde
[Bridge]
Stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
Line up all the bastards, all I want is the truth
Stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
Line up all the bastards,
and we cry when they all die blonde
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, now can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we won?
Hey, hey, now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blonde
[Outro]
Stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards, all I want is the truth
Stack dead actors, stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards,
cry when they all die blonde
