[Intro]
Yes or no, what is truth?
But a dirty black cloud comin' out of the blue?
I was wrong, I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night
[Verse 1]
Break my bones, I don't care
All I ever wanted was a body to share
Heart's gone cold, brush ran dry
Satellite searchin' for a sign of life
[Pre-Chorus]
Like you-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Somewhere, are you there?
[Chorus]
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time
[Verse 2]
Listen close, I can't hide
I'm a page torn from a broken spine
Sun gets low, I get high
Satellite searchin' for a sign of life
[Pre-Chorus]
Like you-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Somewhere, are you there?
[Chorus]
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you there, are you there?
[Chorus]
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time, oh
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
[Outro]
Yes or no, what is truth?
But a dirty black cloud comin' out of the blue
I was wrong, I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night
