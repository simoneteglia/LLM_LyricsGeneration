[Verse 1]
Took the high dive into your brain
And you made your lonely calls
You just might wear your welcome out
If you don’t let it go
There’s nothing that you couldn’t say
'Cause you’ve said it all before
I think it’s time you walked this lonely road
All on your own
[Chorus]
It’s your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
[Verse 2]
I wish I could take it away
And save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head like no one else
Looking for someone to blame?
Did you blame me all along?
You’ll take the heat
But you would never take the fall
[Chorus]
It’s your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
[Bridge]
You’re so afraid that you are the only one
You are the only one
You know
Don’t be afraid because you’re not the only one
You’re not the only one
I know
[Chorus]
It’s your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
It’s your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
