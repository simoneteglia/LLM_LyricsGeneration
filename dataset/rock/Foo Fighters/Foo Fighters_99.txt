[Verse 1]
Leadin' everything along
Never far from bein' wrong
Never mind these things at all
It's nothin'
Couldn't find a way to you
Seems that's all I ever do
Turnin' up in black and blue
Rewarded
[Hook]
All the static
We all left
[Instrument Break]
[Verse 2]
Wait until the time has come
Figure that's where time comes from
Leavin' all my senses numb
Is heaven
Lifted up the fay to see
Anything could never be
Anything but play to me
In order
[Hook]
All the static
We all left
[Instrument Break]
[Verse 3]
Take it back for them to keep
Fallen into somethin' deep
Not that I had made that leap
Anointed
[Hook]
All the static
We all left
[Verse 4]
Where have all the wishes gone?
Now that all of that is done
Wish I would've felt I'd won
For once
