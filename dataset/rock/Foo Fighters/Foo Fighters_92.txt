[Verse 1]
Let's change the subject to someone else
You know lately, I've been subject to change
Normally, I reel in the strange
Hangover, I'm older
You're one to talk, the heart is a clock
Just like a bomb that keeps on tickin' away
Counting down to detonate
You will need an army disarmin' me
[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh-ooh-ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you
[Chorus]
It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind, before, before
It's just a matter of time
[Verse 2]
My past is getting us nowhere fast
I was never one for takin' things slow
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go
Come over and over
Doin' my time for line after line
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?
Prisoners to share a cell with
I'm holdin', still holdin', holdin' you in
[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh-ooh-ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you
[Chorus]
It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind, before, before
It's just a matter of time
[Bridge]
Where the hell were
You, ooh-ooh-ooh
Where the hell were
You, ooh-ooh-ooh
Where the hell were you?
[Chorus]
It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind, before, before
It's just a matter of time
[Outro]
What does it matter now? What does it matter now?
What does it matter now? What does it matter now?
It's just a matter of time
Time!
