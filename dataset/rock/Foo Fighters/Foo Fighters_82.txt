[Verse 1]
You're a real short ride, wow right
They're the big stuff anyway, that's right
You're a teacher's pet, wow right
Still a bleach one anyway, that's right
Wow right
[Chorus]
Colour and the shape
Colour and the shape
[Verse 2]
No sweat yeah, wow right
You're a retard anyway, that's right
Stand to beat your hands away, wow right
Said a river boy runaway, that's right
Wow right
[Chorus]
Colour and the shape
Colour and the shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, hey
[Verse 3]
You're a retard anyway, that's right
Stand to beat your hands away, wow right
Said a river boy runaway, that's right
Wow right
[Chorus]
Colour and the shape
Colour and the shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape
