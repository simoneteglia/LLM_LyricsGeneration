[Verse]
The sun went down on another perfect day
Busy countin' shadows on the wall
The weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
Roses in the whiskey jar, blood on the thorns
Drink until the taste is gone
Cracks in the floorboard are deep from dancin'
To the sound of candles burnin' out
Heavy from writin' your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes, blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your Shangri-La now?
Where is your Shangri-La now?
Countin' down to zero hour
[Chorus]
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, countin' down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, countin' down to zero hour
[Instrumental Bridge with Vocalizations]
[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your Shangri-La now? (Where's your Shangri-La?)
Where is your Shangri-La now? (Where's your Shangri-La?)
Countin' down to zero hour
[Chorus]
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, countin' down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after, countin' down to zero hour
