[Verse 1]
Tonight I'm tangled in my blanket of clouds
Dreaming aloud
Things just won't do without you
Matter of fact
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-oh, I'm on your back
I'm on your back
Oh-woah-woah-oh, I'm on your back
[Chorus]
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
[Verse 2]
If you'd accept surrender, I'll give up some more
Weren't you adored
I cannot be without you
Matter of fact
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-oh, I'm on your back
I'm on your back
Oh-woah-woah-oh, I'm on your back
[Chorus]
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
[Bridge]
Another heart is cracked
In two
I'm on your back, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 3]
I cannot be without you
Matter of fact
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah-oh, I'm on your back
[Chorus]
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
[Outro]
Another heart is cracked
In two
I'm on your back, oh-oh-oh
