[Verse 1]
They knew all along
They're not dumb, they were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now, call when I'm done
Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist
[Chorus]
Head is on, I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome,
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
[Verse 2]
Crazy TV dreams
Might be true, not what it seems
Food and cavities
Chewing words, tear at the seams
He don't feel so good
Don't feel bad, not that he should
I don't feel so good
Don't feel bad, not that I should
[Chorus]
Head is on, I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome,
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Head is on, I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome,
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
[Bridge]
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out
[Chorus]
Head is on, I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome,
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Head is on, I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome,
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
[Outro]
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Did you ever listen?
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out, get out
Get out, get out
