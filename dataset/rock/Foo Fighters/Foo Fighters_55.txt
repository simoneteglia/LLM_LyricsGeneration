[Verse 1]
Seems like only yesterday life belonged to runaways
Nothin' here to see, no lookin' back
Every sound monotone, every color monochrome
Life began to fade into the black
Such a simple animal,
sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore
Desperate, meaningless, all filled up with emptiness
Felt like everythin' was said and done
[Chorus]
I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
[Verse 2]
Still, I tried to find my way, spinnin' hours into days
Burnin' like a flame behind my eyes
Drown it out, drink it in, crown the king of sufferin'
Prisoner, a slave to the disguise
Disappeared the only thing, bittersweet surrenderin'
Knew that it was time to say goodbye
[Chorus]
And I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
No reason left me to survive
You saved me the day you came alive
[Post-Chorus]
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
[Chorus]
I lay there in the dark and I closed my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
[Post-Chorus]
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive! Come alive!
Come alive! Come alive! Come alive!
[Bridge]
Nothin' more to give
I can finally live, come alive
Your life into me
I can finally breathe, come alive
[Chorus]
I lay there in the dark, open my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive
[Outro]
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive, come alive, come alive
Come alive! Come alive! Come alive!
