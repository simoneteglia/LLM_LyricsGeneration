[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be king
I just wanna sing a love song
Pretend there's nothing wrong
You can sing along with me
And I don't wanna be queen
Just tryin' to keep my t-shirt clean
[Verse 2]
There's one thing that I have learned
If it gets much better, it's gonna get worse
And you get what you deserve
[Outro]
And you get what you deserve
