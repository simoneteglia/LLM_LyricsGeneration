[Verse 1]
Woe is me
The end is near, thought you'd never leave
Heart and teeth
Just to taste bittersweet
One last stain to get beneath the skin
Beneath the skin
[Pre-Chorus]
The wish is drawn inside
The never-ending sigh
[Chorus 1]
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
No one lets everyone in
[Verse 2]
Me and you
Draw the line, now it's time to move
Face to face!
Damn the luck, blessed be
Heaven, what's come over me?
[Pre-Chorus]
The wish is drawn inside
The never-ending sigh
[Chorus 2]
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on, let everyone in
No one lets everyone in
In
In
In
[Chorus 2]
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on, let everyone in
No one lets everyone in
In
In
In
