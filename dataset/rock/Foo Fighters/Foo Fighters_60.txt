[Verse 1]
I'm molasses!
Hung in rent!
Read a sponsor!
One shot, no post-show!
[Chorus 1]
Tear it off, but not a lot
It's not enough to debate
[Verse 2]
As if you blame!
Real and stagnate!
Real and stagnate!
Big shit, no shit!
[Chorus 2]
Tear it off, but not a lot
Only so much you can take
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Some try that hit!
Beast and mud lead!
Beast and mud lead!
Big shit, no shit!
[Chorus 2]
Tear it off, but not a lot
Only so much you can take
[Verse 2]
As if you blame!
Real and stagnate!
Real and stagnate!
Big shit, no duh!
[Chorus 1]
Tear it off, but not a lot
It's not enough to debate
[Interlude]
Right?
[Verse 1]
I'm molasses!
Hung in rent!
Read a sponsor!
One shot, no post-show!
[Chorus 2]
Tear it off, but not a lot
Only so much you can take
[Outro]
One shot, nothing!
One shot, nothing!
One shot, nothing!
One shot, nothing!
One shot, nothing!
One shot, nothing!
One shot, nothing!
