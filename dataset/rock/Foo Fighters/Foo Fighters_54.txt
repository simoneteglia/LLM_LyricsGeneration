[Verse 1]
Lately I'm getting better
Wish I could stay sick with you
But there's too many egos left to bruise
Call it sin, you can call it whatever
Eating deep inside of you
Well, if it were me, it's all I'd ever do
[Verse 2]
Steal me now and forever
I'll steal something good for you
The criminal in me is no one new
'Til you find something better
When there's nothing left to use
And everything starts goin' down on you
[Chorus]
I'm the generator, firin' whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is
You go out and it's on
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one that started it
[Verse 3]
Send me out on a tether
Swing it 'round, I'll spin your noose
You let it down,
I'll hang around with you
'Til you find someone better
When there's no one left to use
And everyone keeps goin' down
[Chorus]
I'm the generator, firin' whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is
You go out and it's on
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one that started it
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
I'm the generator, firin' whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is
You go out and it's on
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one that started it
[Outro]
I'm the generator, I'm the generator
I'm the generator, I'm the generator
I'm the generator, I'm the generator, you're on
Yeah, can't you hear my motored heart?
You're the one that started it
