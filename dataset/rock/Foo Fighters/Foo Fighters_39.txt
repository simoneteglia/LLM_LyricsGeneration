[Verse 1]
He needs a quiet room
With a lock to keep him in
It's just a quiet room
And he's there
[Verse 2]
He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friend's guitar
That he played
[Interlude]
Mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mm-mmm-mmm
Mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mm-mmm
[Verse 3]
He's never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He says, "Nevermind"
And no one speaks
[Verse 4]
He thinks he drinks too much
'Cause when he tells his two best friends
"I think I drink too much"
No one speaks
No one speaks
No one speaks
[Interlude]
Mm-mm-mmm-mmm
Mm-mm-mmm
Mm-mm-mmm
[Verse 2]
He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friend's guitar
That he played
[Outro]
When he plays
No one speaks
No one speaks
When he plays
No one speaks
("I can't let you guys get off without screaming a couple of minutes
This one goes out to my sister Lisa")
