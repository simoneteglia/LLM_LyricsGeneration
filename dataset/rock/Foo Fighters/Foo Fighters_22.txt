[Verse 1]
You believe there's something else
To relieve your emptiness
And you dream about yourself, and you bleed and breathe the air
And it's on and on and on and on and on
[Interlude]
I just kinda died for you
You just kinda stared at me
We will always have that chance
We can do this one more time
[Pre-Chorus]
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
[Chorus]
Take me now
We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
[Verse 2]
You believe there's somewhere else
Where it's easier than this
And you see outside yourself,
and you buy the hole you'll fill
But still it's on and on and on and on and on
[Pre-Chorus]
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember Aurora
[Chorus]
Take me now
We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
[Bridge]
On and on and on, Aurora, wait for everyone
Wait 'til the last one's done
On and on and on, Aurora, wait for everyone
Wait 'til the last one's done
[Chorus]
Take me now
We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we'll turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
[Outro]
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
