[Verse 1]
Real life is so hard
We hide in the stars
That's where our heads are
My head and your heart
[Chorus]
This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I wanna detonate
[Verse 2]
When you are so far
I'm fallin' apart
Lose all my sonar
You jam my radar
[Chorus]
This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I wanna detonate
[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel I'm gettin' stuck!
Between the handshake and the fuck!
[Verse 3]
You've got me on guard
I've got my head start
My head and your heart
The same in the stars
[Chorus]
This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I wanna detonate
[Outro]
Sometimes I wish that I could change!
I can't save you from my poor brain! Ready!
Ready! Ready, okay
