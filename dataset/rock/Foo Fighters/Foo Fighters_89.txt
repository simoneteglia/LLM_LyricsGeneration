[Verse 1]
Where you off to with that head of yours?
Is there somewhere you should be?
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
And told you it's not you, it's only me?
Maybe
[Chorus: Dave Grohl,
Taylor Hawkins
]
Don't take what I don't need
(
Give me back my peace of mind
)
Don't say what I don't mean
(
Give me back my precious time
)
No way you'll silence me
You'll see
[Verse 2]
What you up to now your mirror's gone?
Is there someone you should be?
Did you think I was just foolin' 'round with you?
But, honestly
But, honestly
But, honestly
[Chorus: Dave Grohl,
Taylor Hawkins
]
Don't take what I don't need
(
Give me back my peace of mind
)
Don't say what I don't mean
(
Give me back my precious time
)
No way you'll silence me
(
Give me back my peace and quiet
)
Nowhere to hide from me
You'll see
[Bridge]
And tonight I thank the stars, as I count my lucky scars
For everything you've given me
And all the wants I gave to you, something borrowed, something blue
If you want them back
I'll give it to you, give it to you
Give it to you, I'll give it to you
Give it to you, give it to you
Give it to you, I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you, give it to you
Give it to you, I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you, give it to you
I'll give it to you, I'll give it to you
[Outro]
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you!
