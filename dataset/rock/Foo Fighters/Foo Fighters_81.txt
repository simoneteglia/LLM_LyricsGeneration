[Verse 1]
Big baby, run and hide
Hope it don't sting when the feeling dies
I got sweet dreams tucked in tight
Silver screen sister in a suit and tie
Two lovers, sick and tired
Standin' in the mirror, it's my good side
Match made in heaven, show me the light
Burn me right down like a house on fire
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Burn me right down like a house on fire
Cloudspotter, cloudspotter
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Callin' on someone else's dime
Put your two cents where the sun don't shine
[Chorus]
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Swingin' from the left to the right
Bang! Bang! Bang! You're so mean
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang! Bang! Bang! Know what I mean?
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Cloudspotter
[Verse 2]
Head ringin' in the dead of night
Just a pair of lovesick parasites
Put me on hold, hold on tight
Everything's wrong when you've got no right
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Everything's wrong when you've got no right
Cloudspotter, cloudspotter
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I need to know, but I don't ask why
Refuse me while I kiss the sky
[Chorus]
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Swingin' from the left to the right
Bang! Bang! Bang! You're so mean
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang! Bang! Bang! Know what I mean?
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter!
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I need to know, but I don't ask why
Refuse me while I kiss the sky!
[Chorus]
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Swingin' from the left to the right
Bang! Bang! Bang! You're so mean
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang! Bang! Bang! Know what I mean?
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter!
