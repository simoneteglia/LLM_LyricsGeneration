[Verse 1]
Say a prayer and close the light, thumb upon the scale
The pillow is cold, and that ship has sailed
Time has run the river dry, dry as a twisted trail
Into the bone, I'm into it
[Pre-Chorus]
Ever get the feelin' nothin' else will do?
I could hear you singin', pink turned to blue
Was it your graffiti? Did you write your name?
On the dirty ceilin', I can't explain
[Chorus]
I need medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight callin', but it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know
I'm yours
[Verse 2]
I remember dancin' hard under the dead moon
Howlin' with you, howlin'!
[Pre-Chorus]
Ever get the feelin' nothin' else will do?
I could hear you singin', I can't explain
[Chorus]
I need medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight, howlin', but it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know
I'm yours
[Bridge]
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
[Chorus]
Medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight, howlin', but it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know
I'm yours
[Outro]
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
