[Verse 1]
She was a friend of mine
, alone on a dead end street
Dancin' through life on the front lines
She led a quiet life, ends, they don't always meet
Years passed her by waitin' to rise
[Pre-Chorus 1]
She had arrows in her eyes, fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
[Chorus 1]
Arrows in her eyes, fear where her heart should be
War in her mind, shame in her cries
Arrows in her eyes,
tears in her arteries
War in her mind, shame as she cries
Fire away
[Verse 2]
Under a silent light, screamin' biology
Queen Gemini, the world in her sights
I want a new life forming inside of me
Blessed and born into this fire
[Pre-Chorus 2]
You had arrows in your eyes, fear where your heart should be
War in your mind
[Chorus 2]
Arrows in your eyes, fear where your heart should be
War in your mind, shame in your cries
Arrows in your eyes,
tears in your arteries
War in your mind, shame as you cry
Fire away, oh!
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus 1]
Arrows in her eyes, fear where her heart should be
War in her mind, shame in her cries
Arrows in her eyes,
tears in her arteries
War in her mind, shame as she cries
Fire away, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
