[Verse 1]
I'm hangin' on
Here until I'm gone
I'm right where I belong
Just hangin' on
[Verse 2]
And even though
Watched you come and go
How was I to know
You'd steal the show?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
One day, I'll have enough to gamble
I'll wait to hear your final call
And bet it all
[Verse 1]
I'm hangin' on
Here until I'm gone
Right where I belong
Just hangin' on
[Verse 3]
Even though
I pass this time alone
Somewhere so unknown
It heals the soul
[Pre-Chorus 2]
You ask for walls, I'll build them higher
We'll lie in the shadows of them all
I'd stand but they're much too tall
And I fall
[Chorus]
February stars
Floatin' in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars
Floatin' in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars
Floatin' in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
