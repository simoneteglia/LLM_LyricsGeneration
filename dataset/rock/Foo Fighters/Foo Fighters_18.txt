[Verse 1]
It came in a flash, it came outta nowhere
It happened so fast, and then it was over
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Is this happenin' now?
Oh, are you feelin' what I'm feelin'?
This is happenin' now
[Chorus]
We're all free to some degree to dance under the lights
I'm just waitin' to be rescued, bring me back to life
Kings and queens and in-betweens, we all deserve the right
I'm just waitin' to be rescued, I'm just waitin' to be rescued
We're all just waitin' to be rescued tonight
[Verse 2]
I fell in a trap,
my hеart's gettin' colder
It's comin' on fast, it's over my shouldеr
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Is this happenin' now?
Oh, are you feelin' what I'm feelin'?
This is happenin' now
[Chorus]
We're all free to some degree to dance under the lights
I'm just waitin' to be rescued, bring me back to life
Kings and queens and in-betweens, we all deserve the right
I'm just waitin' to be rescued, I'm just waitin' to be rescued
We're all just waitin' to be rescued tonight
[Post-Chorus]
To be rescued tonight
Rescue me tonight
Rescue me tonight
[Chorus]
We're all free to some degree to dance under the lights
I'm just waitin' to be rescued, bring me back to life
Kings and queens and in-betweens, we all deserve the right
I'm just waitin' to be rescued, I'm just waitin' to be rescued
We're all just waitin' to be rescued tonight
[Post-Chorus]
To be rescued tonight
Rescue me tonight
Rescue me tonight
