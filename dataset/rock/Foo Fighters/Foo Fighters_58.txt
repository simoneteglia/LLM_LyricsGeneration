[Verse 1]
And I met the seventh son, ​he came for everyone
​
The day he heard the lightning in the field
​I heard him clear his throat, ​
a fork within the road
That night the Tallahatchie took the wheel
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been throwin' knives to see just where they'll land
​
Now my world is in your hands
[Chorus]
Send in the congregation
​
Open your eyes, step in the light
​
A jukebox generation
Just as you were
[Verse 2]
The voice upon the stage is the heart inside a cage
​And it's singin' like a bluebird in the round
​
There's mystery in this wood and ghosts within these roots
​That are tangled deep beneath this southern ground
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've been goin' through life makin' foolish plans
​
Now my world is in your hands
[Chorus]
Send in the congregation
​
Open your eyes, step in the light
​
A jukebox generation
​Just as you were, right!
Just as you were
Just as you were, alright!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And you need blind faith
​No false hope
No false hope
​Do you have blind faith?
​No false hope
No false hope
​Where is your blind faith?
​No false hope
No false hope
​
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
​Step into the light!
​
[Chorus]
Open your eyes, step into the light
​The sound becomes congregation
A congregation
A congregation
Yeah!
[Outro]
And they're singing like a bluebird in the round
