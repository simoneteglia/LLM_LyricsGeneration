[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse]
I was waitin' for something
Maybe flyin' machines
That's when I found Lili
Best I've ever seen
[Pre-Chorus]
Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
[Chorus]
But there never seems
To be enough space! Space
Space! Space
[Verse]
I was waitin' for something
Maybe flyin' machines
That's when I found Lili
Best I've ever seen
[Pre-Chorus]
Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
[Chorus]
But there never seems
To be enough space! Space
Space! Space
Space! Space
Space! Space, woah!
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Space! Space
Space! Space
Space, space
Space, spaâ€”, hey! Hey!
