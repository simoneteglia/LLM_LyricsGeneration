[Verse 1]
Where have you gone?
Walk in circles back to square one
Made it through yesterday
Spilling wine, thinking of the time
Wrote you a melody
Rolling your eyes, I held your hand a while
Need not say anything to me
Hear you loud and clear, loud and clear
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll take care of everything
From now on
[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
[Verse 2]
Wait for the sun
Say hello, maybe it will come
You watched the hummingbirds
Naming evеry one
Do you have a minute for mе?
If you don't mind, I'll be stopping by
Count all the little black clouds
Don't you worry, please don't worry
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll take care of everything
From now on
[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me how? (Who will show me how?)
[Bridge]
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
From now on
[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me how? (Who will show me how?)
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me, who will show me how?
[Outro]
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
