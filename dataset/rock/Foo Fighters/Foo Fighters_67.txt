[Refrain]
Na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
Na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
[Verse 1]
I've been waitin’, elevatin'
Hangin' on the line
Hate to say it, your new favorite’s
Goin' out of style
Threw away those broken heroes
They're just wood and wires
Hallelujah, spread the news, but
Don't believe the hype
Alright
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start
[Chorus]
But if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite, I'm makin' a fire
[Refrain]
Na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
[Verse 2]
I was beggin’ when I said I’d
Never tell a lie
Luck be damned, I took a stand and
Finally hit my stride
Bye, bye
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start
[Chorus]
But if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It’s time to ignite, I'm makin' a fire
[Refrain]
Na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start
Yeah!
[Refrain]
Na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
[Chorus]
So if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It’s down to the wire
This is the last time, I've
Made up my mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite, I'm makin' a fire
[Refrain]
Na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
(Na-na-na-na) Na, na, na-na-na-na na, na
Na-na-na-na na, na, na-na-na-na na
