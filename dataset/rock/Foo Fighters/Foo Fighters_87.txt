[Verse 1]
These notes are marked "return to sender"
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew
[Chorus]
How good it is to see you
See you
See you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm getting further from myself
One thing is always true
[Chorus]
How good it is to see you
See you
See you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Bridge]
I'm done resenting you
You represented me so well
And this I promise you
How could I end up in the hands of someone else?
[Verse 1]
These notes are marked "return to sender"
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew
[Chorus]
How good it is to see you
See you
See you
See you
See you
See you
See you
See you, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
