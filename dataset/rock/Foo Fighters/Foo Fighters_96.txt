[Verse 1]
I think I spoke too soon
It's time to clear the air
It's quiet in my room
The silence is unfair
I've been hearing voices
None of them are you
I've been hearing voices
None of them are you
[Pre-Chorus]
Late at night I tell myself
Nothing this good could last forever
No one cries like you
No one cries like you
[Chorus]
I've been hearing voices
I've been hearing voices now
I've been hearing voices
None of them arе you
None of them are you
Nonе of them are you
None of them are you
[Verse 2]
I've seen you in the moon
I wish that you were here
You promised me your words
A whisper in my ear
[Pre-Chorus]
Every night I tell myself
Nothing like you could last forever
No one cries like you
No one cries like you
No one lies like you
No one lies like you
[Chorus]
I've been hearing voices
I've been hearing voices now
I've been hearing voices
None of them are you
None of them are you
None of them are you
None of them are you
[Outro]
Speak to me, my love
Speak to me, my love
I've been hearing voices
None of them are you
I've been hearing voices
None of them are you
Speak to me, my love
Speak to me, my love
