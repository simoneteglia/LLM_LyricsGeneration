[Verse 1]
I'm called a cow
I'm not about to blow it now for all the cows
For all the cows
It's funny how
Money allows all to browse and be endowed
This wish is true
It falls into pieces new,
the cow is you
The cow is you
[Chorus]
My kind has all run out
As if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everything worn in, everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend
[Verse 2]
I said you're all
A painted doll, and it caused the walls to fall
How far is he?
Impatiently, that's as far as far can be
As far could be
[Chorus]
My kind has all run out
As if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everything worn in, everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend
[Verse 1]
I'm called a cow
I'm not about to blow it now for all the cows
It's funny how
Money allows all to browse and be endowed
And be endowed
[Chorus]
My kind has all run out
As if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everything worn in, everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend
