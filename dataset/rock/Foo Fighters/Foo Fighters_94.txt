[Verse 1]
Can you hear me, hear me screamin'
Breakin' in the muted sky?
This thunder heart, like bombs beatin'
Echoin' a thousand miles
[Chorus]
Mine is yours and yours is mine, there is no divide
In your honor, I would die tonight
Mine is yours and yours is mine, I will sacrifice
In your honor, I would die tonight
For you to feel alive
[Verse 2]
Can you feel me, feel me breathin'?
One last breath before I close my eyes
This sufferin' for receivin'
Deliver me into the other side
[Chorus]
Mine is yours and yours is mine, there is no divide
In your honor, I would die tonight
Mine is yours and yours is mine, I will sacrifice
In your honor, I would die tonight
For you to feel alive
[Outro]
For you to feel alive
For you to feel alive
For you to feel alive
Aaaaahhh!
