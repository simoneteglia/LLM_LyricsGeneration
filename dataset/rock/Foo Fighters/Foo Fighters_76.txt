[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
There is a secret, I found a secret
Behind a SoHo door
There is a reason, I found a reason
Beneath the subway floor
And I found the water, the devil's water
And walked along its shore
[Pre-Chorus]
Is that what you want?
[Verse 2]
Your channel's changin'
,
the heart is racin'
From voices on the wire
The soul is yearnin', the coal is burnin'
The ember starts a fire
Can we recover love for each other?
The measure of your life
[Pre-Chorus]
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?
[Bridge]
A river, a river
A river runnin' underground
A river, a river
[Pre-Chorus]
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?
[Chorus]
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
[Pre-Chorus]
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?
[Chorus]
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
[Chorus]
I am a river
I, I, I am your river
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
