[Verse 1]
There ain't no secrets anymore
My name's been hangin' on the hook outside your door
Just an old eyesore
[Chorus]
I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healin', Saint Cecilia
, carry me home
To your house of
Broken bones
[Verse 2]
You're out of sight, I'm out of mind
Been sittin', watch your pictures dryin' on the line
Just a game of mine
[Chorus]
I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healin', Saint Cecilia
, carry me home
To your house of
Broken bones
[Bridge]
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go, no matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go, no matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healin', Saint Cecilia
, carry me home
To your house of
Broken bones
[Bridge]
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go, no matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go, no matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
[Outro]
I know no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia!)
Days will come and go, no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia!)
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
I know no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia!)
Days will come and go, no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia!)
Nothing's set in stone, no matter what I say
Days go by
