[Verse 1]
Ain't that the way it always starts?
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped you
station to station
Hey
Don't go and turn the other way
Don't say there's nothin' more to say
Come on, hear me out
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hush, hush, settle down,
button up, don't make a sound
Shame, shame, go away, come again some other day
[Chorus]
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God, you gotta make it stop
[Verse 2]
Chase
All of those memories away
Save them all for another day
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you
Wait
I wanna see if you can shake
I wanna keep all I can take
I feel much better now
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Use me up, spit me out,
let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day
[Chorus]
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God, you gotta make it stop
[Post-Chorus]
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arms
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your heart
[Bridge]
Shame, shame go away, come again some other day
Memories keep hauntin' me, help me chase them all away
Hush now, settle down, button up, don't make a sound
Close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground
Come now, take the blame, that's okay, I'll play the game
I don't care, it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day!
[Chorus]
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria?
Oh, God, you gotta make it stop
[Outro]
My sweet Virginia
Oh, God, you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
Oh, God, you gotta make it stop
