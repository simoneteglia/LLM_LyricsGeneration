[Verse 1]
I had a vision of you, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
I found a version of love, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
[Pre-Chorus]
Waitin' for this storm to pass
Waitin' on this side of the glass
But I see my reflection in you, see your reflection in me
How could it be? How could it be?
[Chorus]
There is somethin' between us
Between me and you
There is somethin' between us
I see right through, I see right through
[Verse 2]
I
had a version of home, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
I had a person I loved, and just like that
I was left to live without him, left to live without him
[Pre-Chorus]
Waitin' for the storm to pass
Waitin' on this side of the glass
But I see my reflection in you, see your reflection in me
How can it be? How can it be?
[Chorus]
There is somethin' between us
Between me and you
There is somethin' between us
I see right through, I see right through
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
There is somethin' between us
Between me and you
There is somethin' between us
I see right through, I see right through
[Outro]
I had a vision of you, and just like that
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
Waitin' on this side of the glass
