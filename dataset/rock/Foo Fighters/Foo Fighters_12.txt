[Verse]
When I talk about it,
carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it, Aries or
Treasons all renew
[Chorus]
Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true
[Post-Chorus 1]
Well, I talked about it, carried on
Reasons only knew
But it's you
I fell into
[Verse]
Well, I talked about it, carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it, Aries or
Treasons all renew
[Chorus]
Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true
[Post-Chorus 2]
Well, I talked about it, put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into
[Outro]
Well, I talked about it, put it on
Never was it true
But it's you
I fell into, I fell into
I fell into
