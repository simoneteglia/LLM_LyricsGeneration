[Intro]
Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began
[Verse 1]
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marchin' in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished makin' sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinnin' me, it's never ending, never ending
Same old story
[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
[Verse 2]
In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're temporary, temporary
Same old story
[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender? Oh
[Bridge]
I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrorin' your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
(Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend)
[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
[Outro]
What if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)
You're the pretender (Pretend)
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others? (Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays? (You know they all)
You're the pretender (Pretend)
What if I say I will never surrender?
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
