[Verse 1]
Lately I've been measurin'
Seems my time is growing thin
Wind me up and watch me spin
Watch me spin, watch me spin
[Chorus]
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?
[Post-Chorus]
I'm just skin and bones
[Verse 2]
All worn out and nothing fits
Brenniv√≠n and cigarettes
The more I give the less I get
But I'm all set, I'm all set
[Chorus]
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?
[Post-Chorus]
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
[Verse 3]
Deep within this frame of mind
Heart of hearts, oh Valentine
Tell my mom I'm doin' fine
Doin' fine, doin' fine
[Chorus]
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?
Skin and bones, skin and bones
Skin and bones, don't you know?
[Outro]
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just hey!
