[Verse 1]
If it all ended today
Would you be fine? Would you be fine?
If it all ended this way
Would you still be mine? Would you still be mine?
[Refrain]
Are you well? I can't tell
Do tell, do tell
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything we love must grow old
Or so I'm told, or so I'm told
You must release what you hold dear
Or so I fear, or so I fear
[Chorus]
But it's beyond me
Forever young and free
But it's beyond me
Forever young and free
[Verse 2]
If it all just went away
Would you be kind? Would you be so kind?
[Refrain]
Are you well? I can't tell
Do tell, do tell
[Pre-Chorus]
Evеrything we love must grow old
Or so I'm told, or so I'm told
You must relеase what you hold dear
Or so I fear, or so I fear
[Chorus]
But it's beyond me
Forever young and free
But it's beyond me
Forever young and free
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
But it's beyond me
Forever young and free
But it's beyond me
Forever young and free
