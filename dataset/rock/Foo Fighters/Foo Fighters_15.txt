[Verse 1]
I thought I knew all it took to bother you
Every word I said was true, and that you'll see
How could it be I'm the only one who sees
Your rehearsed insanity, yeah
[Verse 2]
I still refused all the methods you abused
It's alright if you're confused, let me be
I've been around all the pawns you've gagged and bound
They'll come back and knock you down and I'll be free
[Pre-Chorus]
I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade, I'm sure
[Chorus]
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
[Verse 3]
I had no hand in your ever desperate plan
It returns and when it lands, words are due
I should've known we were better off alone
I looked in and I was shown, you were too
[Pre-Chorus]
I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade, I'm sure
[Chorus]
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you anything
[Outro]
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
And learn from all that came from it
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
And learn from all that came from it
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
And learn from all that came from it
I'll stick around, I'll stick around
And learn from all that came from it
Yeah
