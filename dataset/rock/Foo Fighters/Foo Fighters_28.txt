[Verse 1]
I've been waitin' on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
Never really wanted to be number one
Just wanted to love everyone
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this, more to this
More to this than
[Chorus]
Just waitin' on a war?
Just waitin' on a war?
[Verse 2]
Every day waitin' for the sky to fall
Big crash on a world that's so small
Just a boy with nowhere left to go
Fell in love with a voice on the radio
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this, more to this
More to this than
[Chorus]
Just waitin' on a war?
Just waitin' on a war?
[Post-Chorus]
Just waitin' on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waitin' on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
[Interlude]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 3]
I've been waitin' on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there more to this, more to this
More to this than
[Chorus]
Just waitin' on a war?
Just waitin' on a war?
[Post-Chorus]
Just waitin' on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waitin' on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waitin' on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waitin' on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
[Outro]
'Cause I need more
Yeah, I need more
Just waitin' on a war
Just waitin' on a war
Yeah, I need more (For this and that)
(There's got to be more to this than that)
(Just waitin' on a war) Yeah, I need more (For this and that)
(There's got to be more to this than that)
Just waitin' on a war
