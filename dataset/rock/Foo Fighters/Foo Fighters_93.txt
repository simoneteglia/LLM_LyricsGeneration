[Verse 1]
Have you found your way around the down and out?
I know it must seem long, so long
I'm still tryin' to keep this time from runnin' out
Head down, always movin' on and on and on
[Verse 2]
I never heard this warnin', another early mornin'
Takes me, wakes me into
If you could manage me, I'll try to manage you, but
Lately it's all I ever do
[Chorus]
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
[Bridge]
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'
I know these things must bore you
I can't find another way
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'
I love this leash that holds me
When I try to run away
[Chorus]
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
[Chorus]
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared!
[Chorus]
I felt like this on my way home!
I'm not scared!
I pass the boats and the Kingdome!
I'm not scared!
I felt like this on my way home!
I'm not scared!
I pass the boats and the Kingdome!
I'm not scared!
I felt like this on my way home!
I'm not scared!
I pass the boats and the Kingdome!
I'm not scared!
[Outro]
I'm not scared!
I'm not scared!
