[Verse 1]
I have a choice between the bat or the belt
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt
Spare me confession, it's confession you sell
Maybe I'll fall behind, but I don't mind 'cause I'll catch up!
[Chorus]
I want a song that's indelible, like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
[Verse 2]
Will I be happy on the back of the shelf?
Will you be happy when we're sharin' a cell?
Spare me the questions since you know me so well
Someday you'll realize that I get shy and I choke up!
[Chorus]
I want a song that's indelible, like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What's wrong with this animal, I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up
[Bridge]
Farewell my sweet
paramania
Farewell my sweet
paramania
[Verse 3]
My only promise is that I'll never tell!
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt!
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until!
I take it all back anyway, what was I supposed to say?!
[Chorus]
I want a song that's indelible, like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal, I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up
