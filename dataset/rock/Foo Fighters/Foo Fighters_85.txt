[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been
Livin' in my head,
the rest of me is dead
I'm dyin' for truth
Make me believe
No more left and right, come on, take my side
I'm fightin' for you, I'm fightin' for you
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, take my hand
There is no way back from here
Pleased to meet you, say your prayers
There is no way back from here
But I don't care
No way back from here
[Verse 2]
Wake me, I'm ready
Something don't seem right, I was dreamin'
I was talkin' to you
Memory, mend me
Know I've seen my share, things I can't repair
I'm breakin' to you, I'm breakin' to you
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, take my hand
There is no way back from here
Pleased to meet you, say your prayers
There is no way back from here
But I don't care
No way back from
Here, yeah!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, take my hand
There is no way back from here
Pleased to meet you, say your prayers
There is no way back from here
But I don't care
No way back from
Here, oh yeah!
