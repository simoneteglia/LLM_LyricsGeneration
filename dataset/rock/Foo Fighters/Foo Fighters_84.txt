[Verse 1]
I can be your liar
I can be your bearer of bad news
Sick and uninspired by
The diamonds in your fire
Burning like a flame inside of you
But is this just desire or the truth?
[Pre-Chorus]
So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use
[Chorus]
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I'm not gettin' tired
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I'm not gettin' tired
[Verse 2]
Hangin' on this wire
Waiting for the day I have to choose
Cursed by love so dire
One more boy for hire
One more boy to lend a hand to you
But is this just desire or the truth?
[Pre-Chorus]
So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use
[Chorus]
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I'm not gettin' tired
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I'm not gettin' tired
[Post-Chorus]
Of you
Of you, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
I can be your liar
I can be your bearer of bad news
Sick and uninspired by the
Diamonds in your fire
Burning like a flame inside of you
But is this just desire or the truth?
[Pre-Chorus]
So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use
[Chorus]
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I'm not gettin' tired
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I won't go gettin' tired of you
I'm not gettin' tired
Of you
