[Verse 1]
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head, she sang
[Verse 2]
Come down and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
[Verse 3]
Breathe out so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now, I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head, I sang
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you
[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
