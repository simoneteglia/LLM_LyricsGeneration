[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm glad I caught you on the phone
Thirty hours until I'm back home
Been hallucinatin', me and Sean
Time to turn his headlamp on
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, who you runnin' from?
[Verse 2]
Someone left their haircut on the lawn
Twenty hours 'til I'm back home
Been commiseratin', me and Sean
Think your face is gettin' long
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, who you runnin' from?
[Chorus]
(Sean!)
(Sean!)
(Sean!)
(Sean!)
[Bridge]
You've been waitin' in the waves
Waitin' in the waves
[Verse 3]
I've been sippin' poison just for fun
Thirteen hours 'til I'm back home
Been obliterated, me and Sean
Gettin' good at getting gone
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, who you runnin' from?
[Chorus]
(Sean!)
(Sean!)
(Sean!)
(Sean!)
