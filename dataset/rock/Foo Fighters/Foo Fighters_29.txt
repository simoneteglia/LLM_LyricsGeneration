[Verse 1]
Goddamn this dusty room, this hazy afternoon
I'm breathin' in this silence like never before
This feelin' that I get, this one last cigarette
As I lay awake and wait for you to come through that door
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe I can share it with you
I'll behave, I'll behave, I'll behave so I can share it with you
[Chorus]
You are not alone, dear loneliness
You forgot, but I remember this
Oh, stranger, stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
I'm not alone, dear loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
So stranger, stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2]
And I dream about somewhere, a smoke will fill the air
As I lay awake and wait for you to walk out that door
I can change, I can change, I can change, but who you want me to be?
I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm the same, oh, do you want me to be?
[Chorus]
You are not alone, dear loneliness
You forgot, but I remember this
Oh, stranger, stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I am not alone, dear loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
You are not alone, dear loneliness
You forgot, but I remember this
Oh, stranger, stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
I am not alone, dear loneliness
I forgot that I remember this
Oh, stranger, stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
