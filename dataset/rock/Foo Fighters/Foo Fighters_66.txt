[Verse 1]
I'm not around that much, runnin'
Exhausted, and lost
If it could be undone, will it
Have costed? It's taught
And lost
[Verse 2]
Blowing away, we stray wilted
Exalted, at fault
What if the day had stayed in bed?
These baubles we've brought
At fault
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
After the bliss has long ended
This caution, this fault
Give me a breeze that's long-winded
Accosted, adult
Arrested
[Instrumental Outro]
