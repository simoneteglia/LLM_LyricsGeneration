[Verse 1]
I've been drinkin' dirty water
But I've been here before, after all
The witchin' hour is upon us
So you and I can sing haunted songs
[Verse 2]
In my dreams, I'm climbing ladders
And then I tumble down, rung by rung
And I keep on falling faster
The heart is echoing, on and on, on and on
[Chorus]
I feel an earthquake comin' on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're the morning after all my storms (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
[Verse 3]
You're my sea of poison flowers
Standing in the sun, row by row
I've been drinkin' dirty water
The taste of sweet revenge, best served cold, all we know
[Chorus]
I feel an earthquake comin' on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're the morning after all my storms (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
[Bridge]
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky!
[Chorus]
I feel an earthquake comin' on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel the metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Dirty water in my blood (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I feel a moment comin' on (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Heavy metal in my bones (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a natural disaster (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
You're the morning after all my storms (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
