[Verse 1]
You lost your mind, I could not go
What little time we spent, a penny on the floor
My desperation, a spinnin' top
Revolvin' on and on, a world that never stops
Is it all mine? How could I know?
We threw the rind away, swallowed all the core
Tried levitation, you're not alone
The stars are holdin' open a door we'll never close
[Pre-Chorus]
I have an engine made of gold
Somethin' so beautiful, the world will never know
[Chorus]
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete they will grow
[Verse 2]
Is it all mine? I can't let go
What little time we spent, a penny on the floor
My desperation, is this a curse?
'Til death do us part, for better or for worse
[Pre-Chorus]
I have an engine made of gold
Somethin' so beautiful, the world will never know
[Chorus]
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete they will grow
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow
[Outro]
Fuck you, Darrell!
