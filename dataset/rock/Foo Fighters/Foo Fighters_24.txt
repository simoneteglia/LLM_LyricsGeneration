[Verse 1]
Wakin' up, bottom of an empty cup
Layinâ€™ in your favorite clothes chosen just for you
Make you laugh, maybe I could make you laugh
Books of faded photographs, moments saved for you
Angel dust, tiny little papercuts
Close my eyes
and feel your touch, holdin' onto you
[Chorus]
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be saved now
[Verse 2]
Love and trust, life is just a game of luck
All this time escaping us, until our time is through
[Chorus]
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
You will be safe now
[Outro]
Wakin' up, had another dream of us
In the warm Virginia sun, there I will meet you
