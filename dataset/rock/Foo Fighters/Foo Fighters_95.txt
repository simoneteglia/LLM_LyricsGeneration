[Verse 1]
He floats, floats away
On the ground, he comes back down
[Verse 2]
They float, float away
On the ground, they come back down
[Verse 3]
She floats, floats away
On the ground, she comes back down
[Verse 4]
We float, float away
On the ground, we come back down
[Chorus]
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round
[Verse 1]
He floats, floats away
On the ground, he comes back down
[Verse 3]
She floats, floats away
On the ground, she comes back down
[Chorus]
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
They float, float away
On the ground, they come back down
[Verse 4]
We float, float away
On the ground, we come back down
[Chorus]
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
[Instrumental Outro]
