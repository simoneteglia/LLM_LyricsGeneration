[Verse 1]
No son of mine will ever do
The work of villains, the will of fools
If you believe it, it must be true
No son of mine, no son of mine
[Verse 2]
No son of mine will ever need
To beg forgiveness, no wicked deed
Head full of evil, heart full of greed
No son of mine, no son of mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, the livin' dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don’t forget what your good book says
[Chorus]
No son of mine, no son of mine
No son of mine, no son of mine
[Verse 3]
No son of mine will ever be
Under the power vested in thee
March into slaughter, down on his knees
No son of mine, no son of mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, the livin' dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says
[Chorus]
No son of mine, no son of mine
No son of mine, no son of mine, woah
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
No son of mine will ever say
Words of illusion, oh, this I pray
Heretofore takin’ my name in vain
No son of mine, no son of mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Here we are, the livin' dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says
[Chorus]
No son of mine, no son of mine
No son of mine, no son of mine
No son of mine, no son of mine
No son of mine, no son of mine, woah
