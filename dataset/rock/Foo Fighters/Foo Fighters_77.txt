[Verse 1]
Stick it to the mailman
Pinned against a pot plant
Sick of all the suntan
Oily with the Ray-Ban
[Hook 1]
Take that to the bank and call it a check
Masked without a weapon
[Verse 2]
Skinny as a spit pan
Dealin' with the shit plan
Playin' with my bad hand
Just another rock band
[Hook 2]
Take that to the man and call it a check
Trapped within a contract
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hey there boy, while you were catchin' the
black widow
The rest of us were watching Melrose
[Chorus]
I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to Flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinkin' I get ahead
[Verse 3]
I'm so pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
Miss it and I can't wait
[Hook 2]
Take that to the man and call it a check
Trapped within a contract
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hey man, can't you tell it's still a problem?
See you at the devil's tower
[Chorus]
I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to Flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinkin' I get ahead
[Verse 3]
I'm so pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait
