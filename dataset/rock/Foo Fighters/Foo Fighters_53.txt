[Intro]
These are my famous last words!
My number's up, bridges will burn!
[Verse 1]
Oh, won't you let me twist your faith
It's gettin' kinda late, and I don't wanna wait no more
Oh, may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace, passed your test of faith
Another time, another place, another line upon your face
Another in your way
Down crooked stairs and sideways glances comes the king of second chances
Now throw him in the flame
[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside
[Chorus]
Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down, it's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round, they're all comin' down
Your bridges are burnin' now
[Verse 2]
Oh, let me put you in your place
Love it when you say I'm givin' everything away, oh!
Tell me what's in it for me? Tell me, now, what's in it for me?
No one's gettin' this for free, so, tell me, now, what's in it for me?
[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever keeps you warm at night
(Whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside
[Chorus]
Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down, it's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round, they're all comin' down
Your bridges are burnin' now
[Bridge]
Gather in the ashes, everything's thrown away
Gather in the ashes, scatter as they blow away
Gather in the ashes, everything's thrown away
Gather in the ashes, scatter as they blow away
[Chorus]
Your bridges are burnin' now
They're all comin' down, it's all comin' 'round
You're burnin' them down
It's all comin' 'round, they're all comin' down
[Outro]
(Gather in the ashes)
Your bridges are burnin' now (Everything's thrown away)
They're all comin' down (Gather in the ashes)
It's all comin' 'round (Scatter as they blow away)
You're burnin' them down (Gather in the ashes)
It's all comin' 'round (Everything's thrown away)
They're all comin' down (Gather in the ashes)
Your bridges are burnin' now (Scatter as they blow away)
