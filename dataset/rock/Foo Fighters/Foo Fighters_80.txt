[Verse 1]
Wake up, it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up your mind
I need to know, I need to know tonight
[Chorus]
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razorblade shine
[Verse 2]
Patience, my dear
We could spend a lifetime waitin' here
Maybe this time
I hope I get the chance to say goodbye
[Chorus]
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razorblade shine
[Bridge]
Day after day
Cuttin' away
Day after day
But anyway
[Verse 1]
Wake up, it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up your mind
I need to know, I need to know tonight
[Chorus]
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razorblade shine
