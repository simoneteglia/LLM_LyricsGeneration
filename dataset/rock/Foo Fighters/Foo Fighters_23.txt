[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
[Verse 1]
I know what you're thinkin'
We were goin' down
I can feel the sinkin'
But then I came around
And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothin' mattered anymore
I looked into the sky
[Pre-Chorus]
Well I wanted somethin' better, man
I wished for somethin' new
And I wanted somethin' beautiful
I wish for somethin' true
Been lookin' for a reason, man
Somethin' to lose
[Chorus]
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over, there's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
[Verse 2]
Know your head is spinnin'
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginnin'
Comin' to an end
[Pre-Chorus]
Well you wanted somethin' better, man
You wished for somethin' new
Well you wanted somethin' beautiful
You wished for somethin' true
Been lookin' for a reason, man
Somethin' to lose
[Chorus]
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over, there's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over, there's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over, there's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
