[Intro]
I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watchin' the wide world riot and hidin' out
I'll be comin' home next year
[Verse 1]
Into the sun we climb
Climbin', our wings will burn white
Everyone strapped in tight, we'll ride it out
I'll be comin' home next year
[Chorus]
Come on, get on, get on
Take it 'til life runs out
No one can find us now
Livin' with our heads underground
[Verse 2]
Into the night we shine
Lightin' the way we glide by
Catch me if I get too high, when I come down
I'll be comin' home next year
[Verse 3]
I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watchin' the whole world wind around
I'll be comin' home next year
[Chorus]
Come on, get on, get on
Take it 'til life runs out
No one can find us now
Livin' with our heads underground
[Refrain]
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
Everything's alright up here, if I come down
I'll be comin' home next year
[Bridge]
Say goodbye, oh
Say goodbye, love
Say goodbye, oh
Say goodbye, love, oh
[Refrain]
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
Everything's alright up here, if I come down
I'll be comin' home next year, no
I'll be comin' home next year, no
I'll be comin' home next year
[Outro]
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
I'll be comin' home next year
