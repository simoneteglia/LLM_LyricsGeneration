[Verse 1]
Come and I'll take you under
This beautiful bruise's colors
Everything fades in time, it's true
Wish that I had another
Stab at the undercover
Was it a change in mind for you?
[Chorus]
(It's impossible) I can't let it out
(You'll never know) Am I sellin' you out?
(Sit and watch) Your every move
Move
[Verse 2]
Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue
[Chorus]
(It's impossible) I can't let it out
(You'll never know) Am I sellin' you out?
(Sit and watch) Your every move
Move
Move
Move
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Now that I've found my reward
I'd throw it away long before
I'd share a piece of mind with you
[Chorus]
(It's impossible) I can't let it out
(You'll never know) Am I sellin' you out?
(Sit and watch) Your every move
Move
Move
Move
