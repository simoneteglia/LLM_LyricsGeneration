[Intro]
Look out 'cause you know what you're doing
Turn up the American ruse
Whitehouse, Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom
[Verse 1]
You don't own this,
la-dee-da
You don't own this, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Do you notice?
La-dee-da
Got me goin', how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God
[Chorus]
Hate if I want to, love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate!
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to, hate!
[Verse 2]
You can't shame me,
la-dee-da
Give or take me, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God
[Chorus]
Hate if I want to, love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate!
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to, oh, hate!
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Hate if I want to, love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate!
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones paintin' in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to, hate!
[Outro]
Keep your pretty crosses to yourself
