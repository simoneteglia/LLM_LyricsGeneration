[Verse 1]
Too alarmin' now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
[Verse 2]
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around
[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
[Bridge]
Kudos, my hero
Leavin' all the best
You know my hero
The one that's on
[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
