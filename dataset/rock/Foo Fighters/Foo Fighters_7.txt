[Intro]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Verse 1]
The sky is a neighborhood,
so keep it down
Heart is a storybook,
a star burned out
The sky is a neighborhood,
don't make a sound
Lights comin' up ahead, don't look now
[Refrain]
The sky is a neighborhood (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
The sky is a neighborhood,
(Ah-ah, ah-ah) don't look now
[Chorus]
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
[Verse 2]
Mind is a battlefield,
all hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left,
whose side you're on?
Thoughts like a minefield,
I'm a tickin' bomb
Maybe you should watch your step, don't get lost
[Refrain]
The sky is a neighborhood (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
The sky is a neighborhood,
(Ah-ah, ah-ah) don't get lost
[Chorus]
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
[Post-Chorus]
The sky is a neighborhood
[Bridge]
Heart is a storybook,
a star burned out
Something comin' up ahead, don't look now
[Chorus]
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
(The sky is a neighborhood)
Oh, my dear, Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
(The sky is a neighborhood)
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
[Outro]
The sky is a neighborhood
