[Verse 1]
There you are dancin' at your altar
Beautiful earthling, dressed in kashmir
All your sound echoes through the canyons
Down below they're dreamin',
hear the sirens screamin'
Another time, another world, girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move,
everybody needs some room
There's something out there
[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me
[Verse 2]
All I found, space between the spaces
Standin' in the nothing, and time reclaims you
And as the wind will beat you down, and the wind the only sound
There's something out there
[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
There's a long straight road
Out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside
Baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside
Of me
