[Verse 1]
The rain is here, and you, my dear
Are still my friend
It's true, the two of us
Are back as one again
[Chorus]
Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
[Verse 1]
The rain is here and you, my dear, are still my friend
It's true, the two of us are back as one again
[Chorus]
Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
[Verse 2]
Together now, I don't know how this love could end
My lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend
[Chorus]
Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
[Outro]
Well, I was the one who left you
Always comin' back, I cannot forget you,
Gil
Now I am up in arms again
