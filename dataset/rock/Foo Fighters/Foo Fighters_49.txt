[Verse 1]
Since I'm puttin' down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down my crown
Given the jewels and the answers of May
The thought of bein' ousted
Comes and goes, comes and goes
When I think about it
The wind blows
[Hook]
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
[Verse 2]
Run me out of town
Somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels
Always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways
Gull and noun, gull and noun
Chills and petty Band-Aids
Wrapped around
[Hook]
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
[Bridge]
Good grief
Good grief
[Verse 1]
Since I'm puttin' down
All of the true things around, but I like it
Handed down my crown
Given the jewels and the answers of May
The thought of bein' ousted
Comes and goes, comes and goes
When I think about it
The wind blows
[Hook]
Hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it
Hate it, hate it, hate it
