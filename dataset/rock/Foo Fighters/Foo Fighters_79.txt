[Verse 1]
One more day that I've survived
Another night alone
Pay no mind, I'm doin' fine
I'm breathin' on my own
[Chorus]
I'm here, and I'm on the mend
I'm here, and I'm on the mend, my friend
[Verse 2]
Wake me when the hour arrives
Wake me with my name
See you somewhere down the line
We're tethered once again
[Chorus]
I'm here, and I'm on the mend
I'm here, and I'm on the mend, my friend
I'm here, and I'm on the mend
I'm here, and I'm on the mend, my friend
[Bridge]
Was it you?
Sat alone
Here we go
[Verse 3]
Close your eyes and stay awhile
To take me where you go
Single file, we walk the mile
Who's wanderin' back home?
[Chorus]
I'm here, and I'm on the mend
I'm here, and I'm on the mend, my friend
I'm here, and I'm on the mend
I'm here, and I'm on the mend, my friend
[Outro]
Was it you?
Sat alone
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
