Save
Your shiny little charms
Take 'em off
Take 'em off
Faith
Wish upon a star
But here we are
Here we are
[Verse 2]
Hey (Hey)
Lay your burden down
Turn around
Turn around
Fate (Fate)
Written in the stars
Arm in arm
Arm in arm, we are forever
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Caught in illusion
Not an illusion
Caught in illusion
Not an illusion
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wanin', fadin'
Innocence
[Chorus]
I gave you my heart
But here we are
Saved you my heart
But here we are
Oh-oh, oh-oh
But here we arе
[Verse 3]
Wait (Wait)
Patience (Patiencе)
Patience (Patience)
Are you ready now?
Pain (Pain)
Severance (Severance)
Reverence (Reverence)
Arm in arm, we are forever
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Caught in illusion
Not an illusion
Caught in illusion
Not an illusion
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Wanin', fadin'
Innocence
[Chorus]
I gave you my heart
But here we are
Saved you my heart
But here we are
Oh-oh, oh-oh
But here we are
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
I gave you my heart
But here we are
Saved you my heart
But here we are
Oh-oh, oh-oh
But here we are
