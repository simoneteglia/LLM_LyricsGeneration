[Verse 1]
Visiting is pretty, visitin' is good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a brother
This can be a secret, we can keep it good
Even all they ever wanted had a problem
[Chorus]
This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
[Verse 2]
Fingernails are pretty, fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a markin'
Them balloons are pretty big and say they should
Ever fall to ground, call the magic marker
[Chorus]
This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my past resignations
It's been too long
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Minocin is pretty, Minocin is good
Even all the cysts and mollusks tend to barter
Ritalin is easy, Ritalin is good
Even all the ones that watered down the daughter
[Chorus]
This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my past resignations
It's been too long
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Fingernails are pretty, fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a markin'
Them balloons are pretty big and say they should
Ever fall to ground, call the magic marker
[Chorus]
This is a call to all my past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my past resignations
It's been too long
[Instrumental Outro]
