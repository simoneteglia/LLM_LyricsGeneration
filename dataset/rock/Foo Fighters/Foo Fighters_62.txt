[Verse 1]
I've been meanin’ to tell you
I've been out of my head
Left my heart on your doorstep
You left your hat on my bed
Maybe I'm delusional
Is that so unusual?
[Verse 2]
Didn’t mean to offend you
Was it somethin' I said?
You put me into your locket
And pulled me off of the ledge
Maybe I'm insatiable
A feelin' so sensational
[Chorus]
I'll get by or maybe I won't
I can lie and say that I don't
Waste my time, lately, I know
It's everythin’ or nothin’ at all
Everythin' or nothin’ at all
Everythin' or nothin' at all
Now that all the feelin' is gone
Everything or nothin’ at all
[Verse 3]
Need a new superstition
One I'll nevеr forget
Put your book in my pocket
Put your chain on my neck
Wouldn't it bе dangerous
If nothin' was restrainin' us?
[Chorus]
I'll get by or maybe I won't
I can lie and say that I don't
Waste my time, lately, I know
It's everythin' or nothin' at all
Everything or nothin' at all
Everythin' or nothin' at all
Now that all the feelin' is gone
Everything or nothin' at all
[Bridge]
Never mind, love and hate
Peace of mind, it's a bit too late
[Chorus]
Nothin' at all
Nothin' at all
Nothin' at all
Nothin' at all
Nothin' at all
I'll get by with nothin' at all
Fill my mind with nothin' at all
Waste my time with nothin' at all
It's everything or nothin' at all (Nothin' at all)
[Outro]
Never mind, love and hate (Nothin' at all)
Peace of mind, it's a bit too late (Nothin' at all)
Never mind, love and hate (Nothin' at all)
Peace of mind, it's a bit too late (Nothin' at all)
