[Verse 1]
That night they were burnin' for truth
Down on the corner of 14th and U
They took your soul and they took you for fools
Took all the windows from prisons and schools
Now, what's a poor man left to do?
One heart now broken in two
You start untyin' the hand of the youth
New kids hear the sound of the drummin'
Mother nature, your summer is coming
Yesterday and today
Revolution on its way
[Chorus]
Amen,
it was the feast and the famine
Amen,
it was the feast and the famine
It was the feast and the famine
Feast and the famine
[Verse 2]
Crossroads with nothing to lose
Out of the basement and into the news
Come change, now shit gettin' heavy
Salvation at the ready
You look when I walked by
Still screamin', "'Til I die!"
You can't find peace if you can't find a home
You can't survive as an island alone
Black heart with a gaping wound
Put back together by a troubled groove
Check yourself, wrack your brains
Where is that P.M.A.?
[Chorus]
Amen,
it was the feast and the famine
Amen,
it was the feast and the famine
It was the feast and the famine
Feast and the famine
[Bridge]
Hey, where is the monument
To the dreams we forget? We need a monument
And change will come, and change will come
Is there anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Hey!
[Chorus]
Amen,
it was the feast and the famine
Amen,
it was the feast and the famine
It was the feast and the famine
Feast and the famine
[Outro]
Amen, where is the monument
To the dreams we forget?
(Amen) We need a monument
And change will come, and change will come
Is there anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Hey!
[Instrumental Outro]
