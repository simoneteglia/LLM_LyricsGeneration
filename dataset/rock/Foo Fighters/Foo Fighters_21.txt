[Verse 1]
I woke up and walked a million miles today
I've been looking up and down for you
All this time it still feels just like yesterday
That I walked a million miles with you
[Pre-Chorus]
Over it, think I'm getting over it
But there's no getting over it
[Chorus]
There are times that I need someone, there are times I feel like no one
Sometimes I just don't know what to do
There are days I can't remember, there are days that last forever
Someday I'll come out from under you, out from under you
[Verse 2]
Someone said I'll never see your face again
Part of me just can't believe it's true
Pictures of us sharing songs and cigarettes
This is how I'll always picture you
[Pre-Chorus]
Over it, think I'm getting over it
But there's no getting over it
[Chorus]
There are times that I need someone, there are times I feel like no one
Sometimes I just don't know what to do
There are days I can't remember, there are days that last forever
Someday I'll come out from under you, out from under you
[Post-Chorus]
Out from under you
[Chorus]
There are times I think it's over, there are times I can't recover
Sometimes I just don't know what to do
There are days I can't remember, there are days that last forever
Someday I'll come out from under you, out from under you
[Post-Chorus]
Out from under you
[Outro]
Out from under you
Out from under you
Out from under you
