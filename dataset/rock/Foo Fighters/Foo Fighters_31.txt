[Verse 1]
You say I take it for granted
I say you've taken it all
Say you can take it or leave it
You got your head in the ceilin'
When are you gonna come down?
When you're that high, can you feel it?
[Chorus]
Don't leave me drownin' in your
Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
[Verse 2]
You wanna tell me a secret
You think I'm gonna find out
You tell the lie, you should keep it
Don't wanna know where it's leadin'
Don't wanna follow you 'round
My first mistake was believin'
[Chorus]
Don't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
[Bridge]
Are you a little afraid? A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away? (Do you give it away?) Do you let go? (Do you let go?)
Where do you find it? Oh
[Chorus]
Don't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
Don't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drownin' in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no
[Outro]
A little afraid? A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away? Try to let go?
How do you find it? Oh
A little afraid? A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away? Do you let go?
How do you find it?
A little afraid? A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Give it away? You let go?
Oh
