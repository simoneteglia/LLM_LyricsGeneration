[Verse 1]
Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay
Every direction leads me away
Pray for tomorrow, but for today
[Hook]
All I want is to be home
[Verse 2]
Stand in the mirror, you look the same
Just lookin' for shelter from cold and the pain
Someone to cover safe from the rain
[Hook]
And all I want is to be home
[Verse 3]
Echoes and silence, patience and grace
All of these moments I'll never replace
No fear of my heart, absence of faith
[Hook]
And all I want is to be home
Ooh-ooh-ooh
[Instrumental Break]
[Hook]
All I want is to be home
[Verse 4]
People I've loved, I have no regrets
Some I remember, some I forget
Some of them living, some of them dead
[Hook]
And all I want is to be home
