[Intro]
Yo man, I know you see me here
This is my space man
What you need to do it put your little
Hybrid in reverse and go out the way you came
What? Yo it's about to get real in the
Whole Foods parking lot..
[Chorus]
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
I got my skill and you know it gets sparked a lot
I'm on my grind homie, it's on my mind homie
These fools with clipboards are looking at me
Like the know me
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
You know the deal with the little shopping carts
They got. Listen to what I say
It's getting real in the Westside of LA..
[Verse 1]
I'm riding slow in my Prius
All-leather, tinted windows
(you can't see us!)
Everybody's trying to park you can feel the tension
I'm in electric mode, can't even hear the engine
Just then I saw a spot open up
My timing's perfect! I'm creeping up..
But then this other dude try to steal it
Going the wrong way!
"Hey man I've had a long day!"
[Chorus]
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
I got my skill and you know it gets sparked a lot
I'm on my grind homie, it's on my mind homie
These fools with clipboards are looking at me
Like the know me
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
You know the deal with the little shopping carts
They got. Listen to what I say
It's getting real in the Westside of LA..
[Verse 2]
Now I'm on the inside, looking at my list
Organic chicken
,
kale salad
And a lemon twist
Some girl in yoga pants is looking at me funny
I'm just trying to find a decent
Pinot Noir
For under 20!
Then I take it to the
Cheese counter:
Humboldt fog
!
(Just ran out sir!)
Really dog?
Take it easy man, I try to calm myself
I've been on edge ever since they took
Kombucha off the shelf..
[Chorus]
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
I got my skill and you know it gets sparked a lot
I'm on my grind homie, it's on my mind homie
These fools with clipboards are looking at me
Like the know me
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
You know the deal with the little shopping carts
They got. Listen to what I say
It's getting real in the Westside of LA..
[Verse 3]
This
fool's
on his iphone, talking to his friends
Trying to pick up some cayenne pepper for his master cleanse
You the most annoying dude I ever see, brah
Could you please move? You're right in front of the quinoa...
Damn, I'm about to check out!
Pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out!
The express lane is moving hella-slow
Man, these fools don't know..
[Chorus]
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
I got my skill and you know it gets sparked a lot
I'm on my grind homie, it's on my mind homie
These fools with clipboards are looking at me
Like the know me
It's getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot!
You know the deal with the little shopping carts
They got. Listen to what I say
It's getting real in the Westside of LA..
