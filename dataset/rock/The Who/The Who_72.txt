[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I am a man who looks after the pigs
Usually, I get along okay
I am a man who reveals all he digs
Should be more careful what I say
[Chorus]
I'm being put down, I'm getting pushed 'round
I'm being beaten every day
My life's fading, things are changing
I'm not gonna sit and weep again
[Verse 2]
I am man who drives a local bus
I take miners to work, but the pits all closed today
It's easy to see that you are one of us
Ain't it funny how we all seem to look the same?
[Chorus]
I'm getting put down, I'm getting pushed 'round
I'm being beaten every day
My life's fading, things are changing
I'm not gonna sit and weep again
[Bridge]
My karma tells me
"You've been screwed again
If you let them do it to you
You've got yourself to blame
It's you who feels the pain
It's you who takes the shame"
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
I am a young man, I ain't done very much
You men should remember how you used to fight
Just like a child, I've been seeing only dreams
I'm all mixed up, but I know what's right
[Chorus]
I'm being put down, I'm getting pushed 'round
(I'm being put down, I'm getting pushed 'round)
I'm being beaten every day
My life's fading, things are changing
I'm not gonna sit and weep again
I'm not gonna weep again
[Instrumental Outro]
