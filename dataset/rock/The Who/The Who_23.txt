[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
[Bridge: Roger Daltrey]
I know if I go, things would be a lot better for her
I had things planned, but her folks wouldn't let her
[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
[Breakdown]
[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
