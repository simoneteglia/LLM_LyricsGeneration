[Verse 1]
There's lots of pretty people here sharing
sotries
and passing letters and
There's lots of questions answered
and metaphysical astronomical songs
Words printed all on papers that seem too mystical, it's so magical
People that dance and compute that no one's better than you
[Break]
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
[Verse 2]
There's kings in distant cities who rule their persons and make them happy and
We won't forget about all the servisory congratulatory
Even the animals know that something's brewing and they're all cooing
'Cause in the end I'd like to say: no one's better than you
[Bridge]
I hope you're happy now I've revealed the truth
I've even written this whole song about you
And not about me, and not about me
[Verse 3]
Please don't just laugh and clap right now, this is serious, I'm not delirious
I've waited very patiently just to let you know who should run the show
'Cause we all know these are the facts, nothing to retract,
nothing too abstract
Concluding in this song, I'll say: no one's better than you
No one's better than you
[Outro]
No one's better than you
