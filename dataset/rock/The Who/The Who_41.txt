[Chorus]
We're on our own, cousin
All alone, cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
Being blind, deaf, and dumb
But I've no one to play with today
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do with a freak
[Verse 1]
How would you feel if I turned on the bath
Ducked your head under and started to laugh
What would you do if I shut you outside
To stand in the rain and catch cold so you die?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the school bully, the classroom cheat
The nastiest play-friend you ever could meet
I'll stick pins in your fingers and tread on your feet
[Chorus]
We're on our own, cousin
All alone, cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
Being blind, deaf, and dumb
But I've no one to play with today
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek?
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do to the freak
[Verse 2]
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Would change your expression to one of alarm
Drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push at the top of the stairs
[Outro]
I'm the school bully, the classroom cheat
The nastiest play-friend you ever could meet
I'll put glass in your dinner and
spikes in your seat
