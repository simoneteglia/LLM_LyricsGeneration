[Verse 1]
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl could put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
[Chorus]
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen, pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy, I'm guaranteed to tear your soul apart
[Verse 2]
Give us a room, close the door
Leave us for a while
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young, but not a child
[Chorus]
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen, pay before we start
The Gypsy, I'm guaranteed to tear your soul apart
[Bridge]
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do
You're gonna hit the road
[Verse 3]
My work is done, now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head, it shakes, his fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe
[Chorus]
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen, pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy, I'm guaranteed to break your little heart
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
[Chorus]
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen, pay before we start
The Gypsy, I'm guaranteed to tear your soul apart
