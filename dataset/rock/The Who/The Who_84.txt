[Verse 1]
I'm goin' home
And when I wanna go home
I'm goin' mobile
Well, I'm gonna find a home
And we'll see how it feels
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'
[Verse 2]
I can pull up by the curb
I can make it on the road
Goin' mobile
I can stop in any street
Invite in people that we meet
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'
[Bridge]
Out in the woods
Or in the city
It's all the same to me
When I'm drivin' free, the world's my home
When I'm mobile
Hee, hoo
Beep beep
[Verse 3]
Play the tape machine
Make the toast and tea
When I'm mobile
Well, I can lay in bed
With only highway ahead
When I'm mobile
Keep me movin'
[Interlude]
Keep me movin'
Over 50
Keep me groovin'
Just a hippie gypsy
Come on move now
Movin'
Keep me movin', yeah
Keep me movin', groovin', groovin', yeah
Movin', yeah
Mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile, mobile
[Bridge]
I don't care about pollution
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy
That's my solution
Watch the police and the tax man miss me
I'm mobile
[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, hee-hee
Mobile, mobile, mobile yeah, mm
