[Verse 1]
Deaf, dumb and blind boy, he's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams ain't quite so bad
[Verse 2]
Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be
Loving life and becoming wise in simplicity
[Chorus]
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
[Verse 3]
A vague haze of delirium creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver-sparked glittering gown
And his golden beard flows nearly down to the ground
[Verse 4]
Nothing to say, and nothing to hear and nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony
[Chorus]
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
[Outro]
His eyes are the eyes that transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
and he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride
