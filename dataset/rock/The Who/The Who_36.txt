[Verse 1]
Every year, it's the same and I feel it again
I'm a loser, no chance to win
Leaves start falling, comedown is calling
Loneliness starts sinking in
[Chorus]
But I'm one, I am one
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the one
[Verse 2]
Where do you get those blue, blue jeans?
Faded, patched secret, so tight
Where do you get that walk, oh so lean
Your shoes and your shirts all just right
[Chorus]
I'm one, I am one
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the one
[Verse 3]
I've got a Gibson without a case
But I can't get that even-tanned look on my face
Ill-fitting clothes and I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy, voice too loud
[Chorus]
But I'm one, I am one
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the one
[Outro]
I'm the one
I'm the one
