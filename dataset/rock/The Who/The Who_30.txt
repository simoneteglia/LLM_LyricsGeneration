[Intro]
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
[Verse 1]
Girls of fifteen (Sexually knowing)
The ushers are sniffing (Eau de Cologning)
The seats are seductive (Celibate sitting)
Pretty girls, digging (Prettier women)
Magically bored on a quiet street corner
Free frustration in our minds and our toes
Quiet storm water,
m-m-my generation
Uppers and downers
,
either way blood flows
[Chorus]
(Inside, outside)
Leave me alone
(Inside, outside) Nowhere is home
(Inside, outside) Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train
[Verse 2]
A raft in the quarry (Slowly sinking)
Back of a lorry (Holy hitching)
Dreadfully sorry
(Apple scrumping)
Born in the war
(Birthday punching)
He-man drag in a glittering ballroom
Grayly outrageous in my high-heel shoes
Tightly undone, know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic that their heroes are news
[Chorus]
(Inside, outside) Leave me alone
(Inside, outside) Nowhere is home
(Inside, outside) Where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
[Guitar Solo]
Out of my brain on the train, on the train
Woo! I'm out of my brain
Woo! Out of my brain on the train
Here it comes
Woo! Out of my brain
On the train, on the train
Out of my brain on the train
[Outro]
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
