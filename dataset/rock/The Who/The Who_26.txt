[Verse 1: Nell]
I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
The stick is equipped with the scope and the beam
I'm after your dreams, bitch, don't fall asleep
Or you gon' wake up with some blood on your sheets
I'm off in the creek of the wallin', crawlin'
From the shadows of the darkness, fallin', prowlin',
howlin' up to the moon
Me callin' them goons to run down on yo' room
They stepped in the doom, no callin' for help
Hell is where yo' body fell
And now you repellin' yourself
Well, been as you catchin' shells unless for them dwellin's
Spellin' your fate, these niggas thinkin' they safe
Until I put them in they place
I'm up in his face, too, lil' niggas be fake goonin'
Until I straight bruise 'em
But I'm just gettin' this cash
I look at then step on the gas,
he
done up,
I'm leavin' his ass, glocked, rocked, dropped off, when I pop, pop, niggas hop, then I stop
I'm after the top and my niggas is with
me
We comin' like Lambos chasin' the Jitney
Rember the Whitney, no comparison
Niggas is sellin' it, but I'm repellin' it
'Cause I be that nigga with the drum, gettin' you slumped
I'm off in the trunk, and gettin' a pump
You get what you want, I'm leavin' you skunk
You don't want to see me go and get the Tec
You catchin' the wreck
I'm all in your chest, I'm off at your neck
I'm down for the set, and we is the best
My nigga

[Verse 2: Chris Travis]
You half a gram smokin' ass niggas can't catch me
.45 Cal', push ya ass into next week
Told my big niggas "don't stress, my lil' niggas got 'em"
Caught 'em at a red light, and shot away the damn problem
Niggas wanna talk, but they really ain't 'bout it boy
And if you want beef, I turn ya ass into an almond joy
Chris fuckin' Travis, yeah, boy, I'm the truth
Traded all my damn drugs for a fuckin' rap booth
So I gotta get this money, mane, I gotta get this loot
If you fuckin' with my money, you gon' end up on the news
I don't glorify violence, it's the mothafuckin' truth
Stay up out these fuckin' streets, boy, that's word to the youth
Cramped up in a Honda, ain't no goddamn room
And I'm pourin' up
lean
, by the damn teaspoon
Disrespectful ass nigga, leave weed residue
In your mothafuckin' whip
So yo' mom embarrass you
Bitch
[Outro: Xavier Wulf]
I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
275 be the whole damn team
I don't-I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
275 be the whole damn team
I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
275 be the whole damn team
I don't-I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
275 be the whole damn team
I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
275 be the whole damn team
I don't-I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
275 be the whole damn team
I don't give a damn, nigga, I'mma do me
275 be the whole damn team

275 be the whole-
