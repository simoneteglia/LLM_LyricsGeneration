[Verse 1]
Athena, I had no idea how much I would need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Athena, all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll  get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
[Chorus]
Just a girl, just a girl[x3]
She's just a girl
[Verse 2]
Athena, my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath?
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Consumed, there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
[Chorus]
I'm happy, I'm ecstatic
Just a girl, just a girl[x3]
She's just a girl
[Verse 3]
Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena, you picked me up by my lapels and screamed "leave her"
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep, I didn't mean that
[Bridge]
She's a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didn't mean it, please
She's a bomb
[Outro]
Athena, I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I get along
She's just a girl, she's a bomb[x2]
