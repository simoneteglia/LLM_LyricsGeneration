[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall, but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young,
but I'm just back-dated
, yeah
[Chorus 1]
(Substitute) Your lies for fact
(Substitute)
I see right through your plastic mac
(Substitute)
I look all White, but my dad was Black
(Substitute)
My fine-looking suit is really made out of sack
[Verse 2]
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east
And the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all, just pass it by, pass it by
[Chorus 2]
(Substitute) Me for him
(Substitute) My coke for gin
(Substitute) You for my mum
(Substitute) At least I'll get my washing done
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
I'm a substitute
for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just backdated, yeah
[Verse 4]
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east
And the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all, just pass it by, pass it by
[Chorus 3]
(Substitute) Me for him
(Substitute) My coke for gin
(Substitute) You for my mum
(Substitute) At least I'll get my washing done
[Chorus 4/Outro]
(Substitute) Your lies for fact
(Substitute)
I see right through your plastic mac
(Substitute)
I look all White, but my dad was Black
(Substitute) My fine-looking suit is really made out of sack
