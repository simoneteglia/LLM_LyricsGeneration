[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Yeah, you talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
[Verse 2]
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she starts to shakin'
The dumb begin to talk
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
She's got the power to heal you, never fear
Oh, she's got the power to heal you, never fear
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hear
