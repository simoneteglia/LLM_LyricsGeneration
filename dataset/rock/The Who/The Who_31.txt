[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up all I had
To find you, I'd suffer anything and be glad
I'd pay any price just to get you
I'd work all my life and I will
To win you, I'd stand naked, stoned and stabbed
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you, I'm gonna run and never stop
I'd pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you, I'm going to drown an unsung man
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
[Bridge: Pete Townshend]
I sit looking 'round
I look at my face in the mirror
I know I'm worth nothing without you
And like one and one don't make two
One and one make one
And I'm looking for that free ride to me
I'm looking for you
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
I'd gladly lose me to find you
Gladly give up all I got
To catch you, I'm gonna run and never stop
I'd pay any price just to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you, I'm going to drown an unsung man
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
I'd call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had
[Instrumental Outro]
