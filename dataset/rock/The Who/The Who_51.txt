[Verse 1]
I used to wake up in the morning
I used to feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad
He said, "Son, now, here's some little somethings"
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all
I don't feel bad at all
[Chorus 1]
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright
[Bridge]
Pictures of Lily
Lily, oh Lily
Lily, oh Lily
Pictures of Lily
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 2]
And then one day, things weren't quite so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said, "Son, now don't be silly
She's been dead since 1929"
Oh, how I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright
[Chorus 2]
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
For me and Lily are together in my dreams
And I ask you, "Hey mister, have you ever seen
[Outro]
Pictures of Lily?"
