Her man's been gone for nearly a year
He was due home yesterday, but he ain't here
Her man's been gone for nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday, but he ain't here

IV. Ivor The Engine Driver
[Verse 1]
My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver
I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through
[Chorus 1]
He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile
For an old engine driver
So let's have a smile
For an old engine driver
[Verse 2]
Please take a sweet (Take a sweet)
Come take a walk with me (Walk with me)
We’ll sort it out (Sort it out)
Back at my place, maybe (Back at my place, maybe)
[Chorus 2]
It’ll come right
You ain’t no fool, I ain’t either
So why not be nice
To an old engine driver?
Better be nice
To an old engine driver
Better be nice
To an old engine driver
V. Soon Be Home

We'll soon be home, we'll soon be home
We'll soon, we'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon, we'll soon, soon, soon be home
(Come on, old horse)
[Chorus]
Soon be home, soon be home
Soon, we'll soon, soon, soon be home
We'll soon, soon, soon, soon be home

VI. You Are Forgiven
[Intro 1]
Dang, dang, dang, dang
Dang, dang, dang, dang
[Intro 2]
(Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello)
(Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello)
(Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello)
(Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello)
[Verse 1]
I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?
It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again
[Bridge]
I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap
[Chorus]
You are forgiven, you are forgiven
You are forgiven (You are forgiven)
You are forgiven (You are forgiven)
You are forgiven (You are forgiven)
You are forgiven (You are forgiven)
You are forgiven (You are forgiven)
Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven, forgiven
Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven, forgiven
Forgiven, forgiven, forgiven
Forgiven, forgiven
[Outro]
You are forgiven
You are forgiven (You are forgiven)
You are forgiven
You're forgiven
