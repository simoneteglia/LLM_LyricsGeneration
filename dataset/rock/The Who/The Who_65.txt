[Verse: Mother]
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a wink
But you gaze at your own reflection! Alright!
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself
How can the mirror affect you?
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise?
That you fear me, can you feel my temper
Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror
Do you hear of fear or
Do I smash the mirror? SMASH!
