[Verse 1]
Got a feeling '21 is gonna be a good year
Especially if you and me see it in together
So you think '21 is gonna be a good year?
Could be good for me and her
But you and her, no, never!
I had no reason to be over-optimistic
But somehow, when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
[Bridge 1]
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!
[Bridge 2]
You didn't hear it (I heard it)
You didn't see it (I saw it)
You won't say nothing to no one
(I won't say nothing to no one)
Never in your life (Never in my life)
You never heard it (I heard it)
How absurd it all seems without any proof
(How absurd it all seems without any proof)
You didn't hear it (I heard it)
You didn't see it (I saw it)
You never heard it, not a word of it!
(I heard it, every word of it)
You won't say nothing to no one
(I won't say nothing to no one)
Never tell a soul what you know is the truth
(Never tell a soul what I know is the truth)
[Verse 2]
Got a feeling '21 is gonna be a good year
Especially if you and me see it in together
Got a feeling '21 is gonna be a good year
Especially if you and me see it in together
I had no reason to be over-optimistic
But somehow, when you smiled
I could brave bad weather
[Outro]
What about the boy?
