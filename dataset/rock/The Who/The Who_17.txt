I. We're Not Gonna Take It
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the camp, I guess you all know why we're here
My name is Tommy and I became aware this year
If you want to follow me, you've got to play pinball
And put in your ear plugs, put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
[Verse 2]
Hey you getting drunk, so sorry, I've got you sussed
Hey you smoking mother nature, this is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr. Normal, don't try to gain my trust
'Cause you ain't gonna follow me any of those ways
Although you think you must
[Hook]
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
[Chorus]
We're not gonna take it, never did and never will
We're not gonna take it, gonna break it, gonna shake it
Let's forget it better still
[Verse 3]
Now you can't hear me, your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either, your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing, and pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie to guide you to
Your very own machine
[Hook]
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
[Chorus]
We're not gonna take it, never did and never will
Don't want no religion and as far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you,
never did and never will
We're not gonna take you, we forsake you, gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still
[Bridge]
We forsake you, gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still
II. See Me, Feel Me
[Hook]
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
[Chorus]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story
[Chorus]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story
[Outro]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story
