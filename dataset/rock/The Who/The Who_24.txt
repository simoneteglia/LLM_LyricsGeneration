[Verse 1: John Entwistle]
Happy Jack
wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand
at the Isle of Man
.
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle & Pete Townshend]
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied
[Verse 2: John Entwistle]
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
[Drum Solo: Keith Moon]
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle & Pete Townshend]
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied
[Verse 3: John Entwistle]
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy
[Ad Libs: Pete Townshend]
I saw yer!
