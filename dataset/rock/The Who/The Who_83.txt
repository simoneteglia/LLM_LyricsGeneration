[Verse 1]
Laying on my back
In the newly-mown grass
Rain is coming down
But I know the clouds will pass
You bring me tea
Say the babe's a-sleeping
Lay down beside me
Love ain't for keeping
[Verse 2]
Black ash from the foundry
Hangs like a hood
But the air is perfumed
By the burning firewood
The seeds are bursting
The spring's a-seeping
Lay down, my darling
Love ain't for keeping
Lay down beside me
Love ain't for keeping
[Outro]
Lay down beside me
Love ain't for keeping
Lay down, my darling
Love ain't for keeping
