[Verse 1]
I see a man without a problem
I see a country always starved
I hear the music of a heartbeat
I walk and the people turn and laugh
[Chorus]
Is it in my head? Is it in my head?
Is in my head, here at the start?
Is it in my head? Is it in my head?
Is it in my head or in my heart?
[Verse 2]
I pick up phones and hear my history
I dream of all the calls I miss
I try to number those who love me
And find exactly what the trouble is
[Chorus]
Is it in my head? Is it in my head?
Is in my head, here at the start?
Is it in my head? Is it in my head?
Is it in my head or in my heart?
[Bridge]
I feel I'm being followed
My head is empty
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence
Statements to a stranger
Just asking for directions
Turn from being help to being questions
[Outro]
I see a man without problem
