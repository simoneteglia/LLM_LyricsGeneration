[Verse 1]
Down in Guantánamo
We still got the ball and chain
Down in Guantánamo
We still got the ball and chain
That pretty piece of Cuba
Designed to cause men pain
Whoa, when you light up in Cuba
You won't feel the same again
[Verse 2]
Down in Guantánamo
Whew, still waiting for the big cigars
Down in Guantánamo
Whew, still waiting for the big cigars
Been a breach of promise
Still guilty with no charge
There’s smoke in the forest
And the tumour is getting large
[Verse 3]
Down in Guantánamo
We still got the ball and chain
Down in Guantánamo
We still got the ball and chain
There's a long road to travel
For justice to make its claim
So let's bring down the gavel
Let the prisoner say his name
[Outro]
Mmm, still waiting for the big cigars
Still waiting
Still waiting for the big cigars
Hey, still waiting for the big cigars
