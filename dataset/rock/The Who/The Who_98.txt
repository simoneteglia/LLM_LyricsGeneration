[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I've danced with Linda
I've danced with Jean
I've danced with Cindy
Then I suddenly see
[Chorus]
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands
[Bridge]
Mary is so pretty
The prettiest in the land
Guys come from every city
Just to shake her shaky hands
[Verse 2]
Linda can cook
Jean reads books
Cindy can sew
But I'd rather know
[Chorus]
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
[Outro]
Those shaky hands
