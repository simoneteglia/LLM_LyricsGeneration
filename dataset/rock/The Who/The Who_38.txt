[BETELGEUSE]
Hey guys, awesome seance
Lots of good old-fashioned chaos
You lose —
in your faces!
‘Cause look who's holding all the aces
Hey, it’s great that you ate up my plan
The pooch has been screwed
And shit's hit the fan!
You wanted me gone-
[LYDIA, spoken]
I don't have a choice
[BETELGEUSE]
You wanted your mom
-
[LYDIA, spoken]
It’s my fault she's dying!
[BETELGEUSE]
You messed with the wrong book — now look what you've done!
(BARBARA screams)
[LYDIA, spoken]
Okay! I'll do it, I'll marry you!
