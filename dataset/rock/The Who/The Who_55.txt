[Part 1]
[Verse 1]
I can remember a time when I used to open my eyes in the AM and just
Be grateful for life but now all I do is ask those I love to bury me under the stars in my head
I don't know if I really know what's wrong and right all I really know is what I want to do with my life don't question me
I want to pick up and start again
(Gravity weighing on me)
I am free
[Part 2]
[Verse 2]
Young goat put a hole in the ozone
Melt metal with a flow so cold, yeah
I'mma broke muhfucka and I hate gold
Dress cheap but your dame won't leave me lone
Make love with a whole lot of hate, yeah
Draw blood on the very first date, yeah
Fuck fame I'mma stay lame Blackmage
Big Î¦ on my face I'mma math ace
[Chorus]
Friday night and I just keep on sippin' till I can't no more
I don't got no place to be but bitch I cannot stay at home
Take my bitch in to a room and move the bed out of the way
Make a circle on the floor and lay her down inside the shape
Take my book and open it to page 888
Speakin' tongues and fuckin' while I'm trippin' off a 8th I'm awakened
