[Verse 1]
Baby, pour over
Tell me, are we concrete?
What would you do without my perfect company to your undressed spine?
And I can hear you drag behind my car by your broken legs
Swallowing stitches in her sleep
As she stole my only view, may I never blink
[Chorus]
While you stood over the pavement
I was biting the curb
Sick entertainment
But I'll bet it feels good coming down
Can't bear to wash out the wasted time
Between your lips and mine
[Verse 2]
Zero friends
Followed your voices into a sea of crosses
She blends in with the foxes gold and feels like home
Under the surface, my love
But beware, beware, beware
And take it slow tonight
We're on the other side of the road
I think we're bleeding out
[Chorus]
While you stood over the pavement
I was biting the curb
Sick entertainment
But I'll bet it feels good coming down
Can't bear to wash out the wasted time
Between our lips
So c'mon and swing it back and forth just like
My heart is on a pendulum tonight
If your lungs are mine I only wanna watch your clouds linger in the darkness
[Bridge]
Oh, can't you feel it?
You're feeding on my restless soul
Oh, can't you see that
It's never enough, it's never enough
Oh, can't you feel it?
You feed on my restless soul
Oh, can you see that
It's never enough, it's never enough
Today I saw the whole world
And I think heaven has a plot to take my life
Listen, I'm the one who made you
I'll be the one who brings you down
But this will be the last time
[Chorus]
Bite on the curb
Aw, your sick entertainment
Oh, I'll bet it feels good when you're coming down
Can't bear to wash out the wasted time
Between our lips
So c'mon swing it back and forth just like
My heart is on a pendulum tonight
If your lungs are mine
I only wanna watch your clouds linger in the darkness
[Outro]
Sing it one more time
