[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I know you've deceived me
Now here's a surprise
I know that you have
'Cause there's magic in my eyes
[Alt. Chorus]
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
[Verse 2]
If you think that I don't know about
The little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately
You put things in my way
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while
[Chorus]
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
[Verse 3]
You took advantage of my trust in you
When I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys
And now you've got the nerve to say
[Pre-Chorus 2]
That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while
[Chorus]
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
I know you've deceived me
Now here's a surprise
I know that you have
'Cause there's magic in my eyes
[Alt. Chorus]
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
[Verse 5]
The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal
Are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball
To see right through the haze
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Well, here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while
[Outro]
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and
Miles and miles and miles and
Miles and miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
