[Verse 1]
We will stand and rejoice as one people lifting one voice
You're worthy of glory, worthy of honor, and worthy of praise
We will shout and proclaim the greatness of Your holy name
You're worthy of glory, worthy of honor, and worthy of praise
[Chorus]
You are holy, You are holy
The whole earth sings Your praise
The whole earth sings Your praise
You are holy, You are holy
The whole earth sings Your praise
The whole earth sings Your praise
[Verse 2]
Now of Your goodness we will sing, "Alleluia to the King"
You're worthy of glory, worthy of honor, and worthy of praise
I'm now redeemed from my past, Your people dance 'cause we're free at last
You're worthy of glory, worthy of honor, worthy of praise
[Chorus]
You are holy, You are holy
The whole earth sings Your praise
The whole earth sings Your praise
You are holy, You are holy
The whole earth sings Your praise
The whole earth sings Your praise
