[Intro]
[Verse 1]
I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well with the chords I'm playing
I can't pretend there's any meaning hidden in the things I'm saying
[Chorus]
But I'm in tune
Right in tune
I'm in tune
And I'm gonna tune
Right in on you
Right in on you
Right in on you
[Verse 2]
I get a little tired of having to say, "Do you come here often?"
But when I look in your eyes, I see the harmonies and the heartaches soften
[Chorus]
I'm getting in tune
Right in tune
I'm in tune
And I'm gonna tune
Right in on you (Right in on you)
Right in on you (Right in on you)
Right in on you
[Bridge]
I got it all here in my head
There's nothing more needs to be said
I'm just banging on my old piano
I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(Getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
Yeah, I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
[Verse 3]
I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well with the way I'm feeling
There's a symphony that I hear in your heart, sets my head a reeling
[Chorus]
But I'm in tune
Right in tune
I'm in tune
And I'm gonna tune
Right in on you (Right in on you)
Right in on you (Right in on you)
Right in on you
Baby, with you (Baby, with you)
Baby, with you (Baby, with you)
Baby, with you
[Chorus]
I've got it all here in my head
There's nothing more needs to be said
I'm just banging on my old piano
Getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
Yeah, I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
Yeah, I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
Yeah, I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow, yeah
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
Yeah, I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
(I'm getting in tune to the straight and narrow)
