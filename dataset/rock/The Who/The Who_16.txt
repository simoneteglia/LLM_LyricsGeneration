[Intro]
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
[Chorus]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
[Post-Chorus]
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story
[Chorus]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
[Post-Chorus]
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story
[Chorus]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
[Outro]
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you
