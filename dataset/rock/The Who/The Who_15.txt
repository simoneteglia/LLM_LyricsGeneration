[Verse 1]
Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest
[Chorus]
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
[Verse 2]
Well, the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street
[Chorus]
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
[Pre-Chorus]
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
[Chorus]
She's playin' all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
[Bridge]
She goes, "Squeeze me
Come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do"
I'm so in love with you
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
[Pre-Chorus]
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
[Chorus]
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
