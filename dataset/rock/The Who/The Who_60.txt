[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: Jimmy]
A beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Crazy days, crazy days
Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces?
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
[Pre-Chorus 1: Ace Face]
I've got a good job, and I'm newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel, all gilt, and flash
Remember the gaff, where the doors we
smashed
?
[Chorus: Ace Face]
(Bell boy!) I gotta get running now
(Bell boy!)
Keep my lip buttoned down
(Bell boy!) Carry this baggage out
(Bell boy!)
Always running
At someone's bleeding heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel
[Bridge: Ace Face]
Some nights, I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks
[Verse 2: Jimmy]
A beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3: Jimmy]
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
(Crazy days, crazy days)
(Crazy days, crazy days)
Ain't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces?
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '63
[Pre-Chorus 2: Ace Face]
People often change, but when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot from a life like mine
The secret to me, it ain't flown like a flag
I carry it behind this bleeding little badge
what says
[Chorus: Ace Face]
(Bell boy!) I gotta get running now
(Bell boy!) Keep the lip buttoned down
(Bell boy!) Carry the bloody baggage out
(Bell Boy!) Always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel
[Instrumental Outro]
