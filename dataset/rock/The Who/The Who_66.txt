[Chorus: JPEGMAFIA]
Mmm, ooh, I look the best with this hue (Hue)
I am a vegetable too (Mmm)
I got a million in profit
(
Listen
)
I brought them decimals through (Phew, phew)
Blessings for you (
Ahh
)
I write a hit while I'm takin’ a deuce
Upload and get 20 views
(Not a game)
I'm in the struggle for real
You know I struggle with truth (Set!)
I should get killed for my views
But I won't cause I’m a- (
Ooh, ooh
)
Ooh, they don't wan' see me lose
Fuck I'ma do? I'ma sell out like The Who
(
You think you know me
)
[Verse 1: Eyas &
JPEGMAFIA
]
I used to dream, but now it all seems
So pointless to me, when I'll never be
(
Hit while I'm takin' a deuce
Upload and get 20 views
)
But really, these are the lies that I tell myself
Leave me alone, I don’t need your help (
Ayy, ayy
)
Given the time, soon I’ll be alright
I'll dream again, or will I?
I used to (
Ooh
)
[Chorus: JPEGMAFIA]
Ooh, I look the best with the shoes
I am a vegetable too
I got a million in profit
So I brought them decimals through (Mmm, ha)
Blessings for you
I write a hit while I’m takin' a deuce
Upload and get 20 views (Not a game)
I'm in the struggle for real
You know I struggle with truth (Set!)
I should get killed for my views
But I won't cause I’m a- (
Ooh, ooh
)
Ooh, they don't wan' see me lose (Phew, phew)
Fuck I'ma do? I'ma sell out like The Who
[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
I wrote this song on a bus, now I'm bummin' in a coupe
You just hate the way I move, catch your du- after school
Amazon Prime with the new Glock, one click and it used
You think you're special because you can levi-duh-levi-duh
Damn (
Damn
), ooh (Ooh), no tax for a tool
I write a blog on a bitch, don't care about who
I don't really want to, y'all already know how I do
Baby, all I wanna see is you
[Outro: Eyas]
I used to love, but I was never enough
For anyone's time, not even mine
Not even mine
