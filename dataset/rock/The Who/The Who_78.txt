[Verse 1]
There are men high up there fishing
Haven't seen quite enough of the world
I ain't seen a sign of my hero
And I'm still diving down for pearls
[Chorus]
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy, let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
[Verse 2]
I'm flowing under bridges
Then flying through the sky
I'm travelling down cold metal
Just a tear in baby's eye
[Chorus]
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy, let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
Set me free
[Bridge]
I am not the actor
This can't be the scene
But I am in the water
As far as I can see
[Verse 3]
I'm remembering distant memories
Recalling other names
Rippling over canyons
And boiling in the train
[Chorus]
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy, let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
Set me free
Set me free
[Outro]
I want to drown
In cold water
