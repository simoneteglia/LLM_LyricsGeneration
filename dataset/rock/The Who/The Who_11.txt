[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That
deaf, dumb, and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball
[Chorus 1: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]
He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist
[Post-Chorus: Pete Townshend &
Roger Daltrey
]
How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?
[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see, no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball
[Chorus 2: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend]
I thought I was
the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Even on my favourite table, he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
, never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
