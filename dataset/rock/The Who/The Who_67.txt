[Verse 1]
Here by the sea and sand
Nothing ever goes as planned
I just couldn't face going home
It was just a drag on my own
They finally threw me out
My mum got drunk on stout
My dad couldn't stand on two feet
As he lectured about morality
And now I guess the family's complete
With me hanging round on the street
Or here on the beach
[Verse 2]
The girl I love is a perfect dresser
Wears every fashion, gets it to the tee
Heavens above, I've got to match her
She knows just how she wants her man to be
Leave it to me
[Verse 3]
My jacket's going to be cut slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear
my wartime coat
in the wind and sleet
[Verse 4]
I see her dance across the ballroom
UV light making star-shine of her smile
I am the Face
, she has to know me
I'm dressed up better than anyone within a mile
[Verse 5]
So how come the other
tickets
look much better?
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter
How come the girls come on, oh so cool
Yet when you meet them, everyone's a fool?
[Verse 6]
Come sleep on the beach
Keep within my reach
I just want to die with you here
I'm feeling so high with you here
I'm wet and I'm cold
But thank God I ain't old
Why didn't I say what I mean?
I should have split home at fifteen
There's a story that the grass is so green
What did I see? Where have I been?
Nothing is planned by the sea and the sand
[Outro]
I'm the Face if you want it
