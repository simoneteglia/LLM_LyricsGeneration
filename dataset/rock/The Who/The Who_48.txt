[Verse 1]
Laugh and say I'm green
I've seen things you've never seen
Talk behind my back
I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink 'til I drop down
With one eye on my clothes
[Pre-Chorus]
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
Got a bet there? I'll meet it
Gettin' high? You can't beat it
[Chorus]
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled, you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
[Verse 2]
You say she's a virgin
But I'm gonna be the first in
Her fella's gonna kill me?
Oh, fucking will he
I'm seeing d-double
Don't miss me if you can
There's gonna be trouble
When she chooses her man
[Pre-Chorus]
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
Got a bet there? I'll meet it
Gettin' high? You can't beat it
[Chorus]
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled, you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
[Bridge]
Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
[Verse 3]
I'm going back soon
Home to get that baboon
Who cut up my eye
Tore up my Levis
I'm feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down
[Pre-Chorus]
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? I'll rape it
[Pre-Chorus]
Got a bet there? I'll meet it
Gettin' high? You can't beat it
[Pre-Chorus]
What is it? I'll take it
Who is she? Ooh, I'll rape it
[Chorus]
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled, you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
[Bridge]
Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
