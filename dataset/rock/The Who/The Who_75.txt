[Verse 1: Pete Townshend]
The song is over
It's all behind me
I should have known it
She tried to find me
[Verse 2: Pete Townshend]
Our love is over
They're all ahead now
I've got to learn it
I'm gonna sing out
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Pete Townshend]
When I walked in through the door
Thought it was me I was looking for
She was the first song I ever sang
But it stopped as soon as it began
[Verse 3: Pete Townshend]
Our love is over
It's all behind me
They're all ahead now
Can't hope to find me
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free, to the free
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4: Pete Townshend]
The song is over
I'm left with only tears
I must remember
Even if it takes a million years
[Outro: Pete Townshend,
Roger Daltrey
]
The song is over
The song is over
Excepting one note, pure and easy
Playing so free, like a breath rippling by
