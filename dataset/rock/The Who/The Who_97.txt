[Intro: Pete Townshend]
What's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
And that's fair
We never really got along
It's not new, not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey &
Pete Townshend
]
All this music will fade
(Ooh-ooh, oh, yeah)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Ooh-ooh)
All this music will fade
(Ooh-ooh, oh, yeah)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Ooh-ooh)
[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
I'm long gone
And I ain't never coming back
White swan
I never really quite got black
I'm not blue, I'm not pink
I'm just grey, I'm afraid
And it seems in a blink
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey &
Pete Townshend
]
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
All this music will fade
(All this music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
[Bridge: Pete Townshend]
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
I don't mind
Other guys ripping off my song
I'd be lyin'
If I said I never done no wrong
All this sound that we share
Has already been played
And it hangs in the air
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey &
Pete Townshend
]
All this music will fade
(This music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Just like the edge of a blade)
All this music will fade
(This music will fade)
Just like the edge of a blade
[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
That's fair
'Cause we never really got along
It's not new, not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey &
Pete Townshend
]
All this music will fade
(Ooh-ooh, oh, yeah)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Ooh-ooh)
All this music will fade
(Ooh-ooh, oh, yeah)
Just like the edge of a blade
(Ooh-ooh)
All this music will fade
[Outro: Pete Townshend]
What's yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine
What's yours is yours
Yours is yours, and what's mine is mine
And what's mine is mine, and what's mine is yours
Who gives a fuck?
