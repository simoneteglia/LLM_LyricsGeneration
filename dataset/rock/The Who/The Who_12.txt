[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey,
Pete Townshend, & John Entwistle
]
People try to put us d-down
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
Just because we get around
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
I hope I die before I get old
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
This is my generation
This is my generation, baby
[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey,
Pete Townshend, & John Entwistle
]
Why don't you all f-f-fade away
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
And don't try to dig what we all s-s-say
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
I'm not tryin' to cause a big s-s-sensation
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-generation
(
Talkin' 'bout my generation
)
[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
My generation
This is my generation, baby
