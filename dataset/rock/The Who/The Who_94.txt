[Verse 1]
Speak to me of universal law
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
All around me, people bleed
Speak to me your song of greed
[Verse 2]
Speak to me of your inner charm
Of how you'll keep me safe from harm
I don't think so, I don't see
Speak to me of your inner peace
[Verse 3]
Little people at the amusement park
City people in the dark
Speak to us, send us a sign
Just give us something to keep us trying
[Chorus]
And the whores hustle and the hustlers whore
Too many people are out of love
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
This city's ripped right to the core
[Bridge]
Speak to me of heroin and speed
Of genocide and suicide, of syphilis and greed
Speak to me the language of love
The language of violence, the language of the heart
This isn't the first time I've asked for money or love
Heaven and earth don't ever mean enough
Speak to me of heroin and speed
Just give me something I can believe
[Chorus]
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
Too many people are out of love
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
This city's ripped right to the core
