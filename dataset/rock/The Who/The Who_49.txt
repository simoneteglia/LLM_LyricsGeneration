[Verse 1]
Look, he's crawling up my wall
Black and hairy, very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread
[Chorus]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
[Verse 2]
Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now? I can't see
[Chorus]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
[Bridge]
Creepy, crawly, creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
[Verse 3]
There he is, wrapped in a ball
Doesn't seem to move at all
Perhaps he's dead, I'll just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor
[Chorus]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
[Bridge]
Creepy, crawly, creepy, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
Creepy, creepy, crawly, crawly
[Verse 4]
He's come to a sticky end (Creepy, crawly)
Don't think he will ever mend (Creepy, crawly)
Never more will he crawl 'round (Creepy, crawly)
He's embedded in the ground (Creepy, crawly)
[Chorus]
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
