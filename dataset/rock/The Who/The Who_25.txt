[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1]
Only love can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields
[Chorus]
Love, reign o'er me
Love, reign o'er me
Rain on me
Rain on me
[Verse 2]
Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from all high
[Chorus]
Love, reign o'er me
Rain on me, rain on me
Love, reign o'er me
Rain on me, rain on me
[Bridge]
On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone
I need to get back home to cool, cool rain
I can't sleep and I lay and I think
The night is hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink of cool, cool rain
[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Love, reign o'er me
Reign o'er me, o'er me, o'er me, whoa
Love, reign o'er me
O'er me
[Outro]
Love
