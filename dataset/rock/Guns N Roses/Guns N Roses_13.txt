[Intro]
When you're talkin' to yourself
And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone, alone
[Chorus]
So nobody ever told you, baby
How it was gonna be?
What'll happen to you, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see
(One, two)
[Verse 1]
Old at heart, but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart
[Bridge]
I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
And what more could you ask from me?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everything
Said, you took everything from me
Hey, yeah
[Verse 2]
Young at heart, and it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out
[Pre-Chorus]
Still, talkin' to myself
And nobody's home, alone
[Chorus]
So nobody ever told us, baby
How it was gonna be
What'll happen to us, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see
[Instrumental Break 03:38-05:21]
[Verse 3]
When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
With all the changin' seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
And now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
Back down on the ground
And you don't talk so loud
And you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?
[Instrumental Break 06:01-06:33]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
And drifting all alone
If it doesn't show
Give it time to read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
And the waves, they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?
[Instrumental Break 07:25-08:22]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 5/Outro]
I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through
This time
Woah, this time
Without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die
