Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
[Chorus: Axl Rose]
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah

Ooh-oh yeah, oh yeah, aw
[Verse 2: Axl Rose]
Mama, put my guns in the ground (Ooh)
I can't shoot them anymore (Ooh)
That cold black cloud is comin' down (Ooh)
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door (Ooh)
[Chorus: Axl Rose]
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ayy hey yeah
Ooh

You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation, Jack
Because it's just you against your tattered libido, the bank, and the mortician, forever, man
And it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive
