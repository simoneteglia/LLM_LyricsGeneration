[Intro]
Yeah!
[Verse 1]
I'm from South Philadelphia
I'm from Avenue C
I've seen empty hands that was waiting to freeze
I'm from the Bowery, too!
[Chorus]
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
[Verse 2]
I've seen Hollywood Boulevard, welfare hotel
And I spent the night in jail at the Wilcox Hotel
[Chorus]
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
I don't care 'bout you
[Verse 3]
I've seen an old man have a heart attack in Manhattan
Well, he died while we just stood there looking at him
Ain't he cute?
[Chorus]
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
I don't care 'bout you
[Verse 4]
I seen men rolling drunks, I seen bodies in the streets
I saw a man who was sleeping in his own puke
And a man with no legs crawling down
Fifth Street trying just to get something to eat
[Chorus]
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
I don't care 'bout you, fuck you
[Outro]
Uh, that hurt, man
Alright
Perfect
