[Verse 1]
Listen motherfuckers to this song that should be heard
Dragged down in the gutters, it's more than you deserve
Screaming fucking banshee, you know that's what you are
Pussy full of maggots, isn't that absurd
[Chorus]
What can I do? With a bitch like you
All I have I ask of you
I'll be dammed
If it's not true
Every word of you
A bitch like you
[Bridge]
My home
Just a world away
Let's drift away
[Verse 2]
Little dreamer with your head down in the stars
Fucking little schemer got yourself a broken heart
Syphilitic priestess baby I know who you are
Parasitic demons sucking acid through your heart
[Chorus]
But what can I do? With a bitch like you
You know that it's true
All I have I ask of you
I'll be dammed
If it's not true
Every word about you
Bitch like you
