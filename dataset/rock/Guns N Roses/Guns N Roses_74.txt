[Intro]
Ow
[Verse 1]
I've been lookin' for a trace
Lookin' for a heart
Lookin' for a lover in a world
That's much too dark
[Pre-Chorus]
Because you don't want my love
No, no, you want satis-satisfaction
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You don't need my love
You gotta find yourself another
Another piece, another piece of the action
[Verse 2]
Said where you going
What you gonna do
I been lookin' everywhere
I been lookin' for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Because you don't want my love
No, no, you want satis-satisfaction
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You don't need my love
You gotta find yourself another
Another piece, another piece of the action
[Chorus]
You're crazy, hey hey
You know you're crazy, oh my
You're fuckin crazy, oh child
You know you're crazy
[Bridge]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ah, ah, ah, aw yeah
Woah, yeah, ayeah, ayeah, ayeah

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Woah, ho

[Verse 3]
Say boy where ya comin' from
Where'd ya get that point of view
When I was younger
I knew a motherfucker like you
And they said
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want my love
You want to satis-satisfaction, bitch
You don't need my love
You've got to find yourself another
Another piece, another piece, of the action
[Chorus]

You know you're crazy, hey hey hey
