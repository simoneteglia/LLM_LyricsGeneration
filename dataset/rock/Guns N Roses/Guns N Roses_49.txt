[Intro]
Oh
[Verse 1]
Kickin' back in the shadow
Got no need for the light
Who's sorry now, old-timer?
Look at how you've spent your life
Scrounging for change to put some money in your pocket
My, how scratch does burn
Laughing at the suckers as you pissed it away
But I got the time, even I got the muscle
I got the need to lay it all on the line
I ain't afraid of your smokescreen hustle
[Chorus]
It's a perfect crime
Goddammit, it's a perfect crime
Motherfucker, it's a perfect crime
I said it's perfect
[Verse 2]
Keep the demons down and drag the skeletons out
I got a blind man following me in chains
I said, he's fun to watch when the world has stopped
And I think he's got something to say
You wanna fuck with me?
Don't fuck with me
'Cause I'm what you'll be
So don't fuck with me
If you had a better sense
You'd just step aside from the bad side of me
Don't fuck with the bad side of me
Stay away from the bad side of me
Don't fuck with the bad side
[Bridge]
(T minus 1:09 and counting)
Ostracized, but that's alright
I was thinking about something myself
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Call on everybody who's got last rites
Said it's better if you locked them away
Running through the visions at the speed of light
Won't you let me be?
Motherfucker, just let me be
Goddammit, better let me be
Don't you know you better let me, aah
[Chorus]
Perfect crime
Goddammit, it's a perfect crime
Motherfucker, it's a perfect crime
Don't you know, it's a perfect crime?
