[Chorus]
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me
Breaking me down with an endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible, I am unstoppable
[Pre-Chorus]
Some may convince you, no one can break through
I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you
[Chorus]
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe
Can't understand why it seems like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable
[Pre-Chorus]
No one can make you do what they want to
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you
[Chorus]
(Ay-oh)
(I'd give anything to know)
Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh)
(I would have never made it so far)
Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
Some may convince you, no one can break through
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you
[Chorus]
(Ay-oh)
(I'd give anything to know)
Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh)
(I would have never made it so far)
Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you
(Ay-oh)
(I'd give anything to know)
Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh)
(How you live with yourself)
I just refuse
(Ay-oh)
(I would have never made it so far)
Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh)
(All by myself)
'Cause I just won't let you
