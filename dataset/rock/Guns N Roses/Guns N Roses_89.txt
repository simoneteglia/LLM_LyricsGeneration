[Intro]
Ready
Whole different beast
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Oh-oh yeah, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
Well if you don't like it
Go ahead find yourself a saint
Go ahead now try to find a boy
Who's gonna be what I ain't
What you need is
A plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through the madness
And always act so quaint
Well, maybe, yeah
Oh yeah, well, a
It's your new friend
You're really making a scene
And I've seen you
Bouncing around from machine to machine
But you know that they're never real
Never really what they seem
And you can count on
Generate some warmth
Then you'll see just what I mean
Oh, baby, baby, baby, yeah
[Chorus]
And if I'm acting like a king
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk 'round with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no, a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being
[Verse 2]
Won't you give me a little sip?
Why don't you give me a drag of that cigarette?
Why don't you try to give me something
That I'll never ever forget?
But now, could you blow it all on a million-dollar bet
Because you're liable to lose it
On the best loving, you've never had yet
Oh, baby, baby, oh yeah
[Chorus]
And if I'm acting like a king
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk 'round with my head on down
Just like a human, oh no, a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real proud human being
[Bridge]
It's like I'm talking about the human race
You're trying to cover up a big disgrace
Oh, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
[Guitar Solo 1]
[Verse 3]
Well, I may think that this whole scene is just a
Too appalling for me
Well, I may be the type who's just mad about
Every little thing that I see, but I can
Color that with history, and make it
Just what I want it to be, well I'm
Blowing my change on the fan magazines
With all the Hollywood refugees
Oh, baby, baby, oh yeah
[Chorus]
And if I'm acting like a king
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
Don't you know it's 'cause I'm a human being
I don't gotta walk 'round with my head on down
Just like a human, whoa no, a human being
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, a real, real human being
[Guitar Solo 2]
I'm a human being
I'm a human being
I'm a human being
Ha hahaha haha ha
I'm a human being
Oh yeah
I'm a human being yeah
I'm a human being
Ooh yeah
I'm a human being
Oh yeah
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a human being
I'm a human being
Ooh yeah
