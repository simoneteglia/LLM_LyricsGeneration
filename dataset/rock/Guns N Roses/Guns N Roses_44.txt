[Intro]
Rollin'
One, two, three, one, two, three
Two, three, one and
[Verse 1]
I tried so hard just to get through to you
But your head's so far from the realness of truth
Was it just a come-on in the dark? Was it meant to last long?
I think you've worn your welcome, honey
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song
[Bridge]
One, two, three, one
[Verse 2]
Time can pass slowly and things always change
Your days been numbered and I've read your last page
You was just a temporary lover, honey, you ain't the first
Lots of others came before you, woman
Said, but you been the worst, said, you been the worst
[Bridge]
Two, three and
[Verse 3]
So, goodbye to you, girl, so long, farewell
I can't hear you crying, your jivin's been hell
So, look for me walking down your street at night
I'll be in with another, deep down inside
Deep down inside
[Outro: Duff,
Slash

That was a take!
