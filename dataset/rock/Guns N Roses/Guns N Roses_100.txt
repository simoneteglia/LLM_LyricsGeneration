[Verse 1]
Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find
[Chorus]
That it's alright, it's alright
[Verse 2]
Where to go? Where to see?
It's always been that way and it can never be
[Chorus]
But it's alright, yeah, it's alright
[Verse 3]
Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
[Chorus]
That it's alright, it's alright
[Verse 4]
Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through
[Chorus]
But it's alright, it's alright
[Verse 5]
Told you once about your friends and neighbors
They were always seeking but they'll never find
[Chorus]
That it's alright, it's alright
