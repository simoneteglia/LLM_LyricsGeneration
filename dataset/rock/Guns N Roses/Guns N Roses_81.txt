[Verse 1]
You got your hair down
I got this top back
Kissin' on my neck
Girl, you got to stop that
Do you want that fast lane?
Or do you want that back seat?
Girl, you got to pick one
You can't expect me
To keep my hands to myself
[Chorus]
She ain't into wine and dinin'
She's shootin' whiskey, singin' Sweet Child of Mine, man
Ridin' '95, sittin' shotgun pretty
Turnin' this town into Paradise City
Runnin' wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses
[Verse 2]
She's got a wild side
Bet trouble's in her blood
Thinks I'm an outlaw
That's double trouble son
She likes to rock hard
She likes to kiss soft
Hot as a barrel on a 12-gauge sawed-off
Ain't hard to please, long as you got speed
[Chorus]
She ain't into wine and dinin'
She's shootin' whiskey, singin' Sweet Child of Mine, man
Ridin' '95, sittin' shotgun pretty
Turnin' this town into Paradise City
Runnin' wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah, my baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah
[Bridge]
Yeah, she's dancin' with the devil
In the cold November Rain
When she's Knockin' on Heaven's Door, son
You can bet God'll call her name
[Chorus]
She ain't into wine and dinin'
She's shootin' whiskey, singin' Sweet Child of Mine, man
Ridin' '95, sittin' shotgun pretty
Turnin' this town into Paradise City
Runnin' wide ass open
Just as fast as this thing goes, boy
Give me some more
She's my little rock star, man, she knows it
My baby's Guns N' Roses
Yeah, my baby's Guns N' Roses
Yes, my baby's Guns N' Roses
Yes, my baby's Guns N' Roses
