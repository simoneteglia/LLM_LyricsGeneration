[Intro]
Oh, baby
Pretty baby
Oh, honey
You let me down, honey
[Verse 1]
I ain't playing childhood games no more
I said, it's time for me to even the score
So, stake your claim, your claim to fame
But, baby, call another name
When you feel the fire, woah
And taste the flame, woah yeah yeah
[Chorus]
Back off, back off, bitch
Down in the gutter, dying in the ditch
You better back off, back off, bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off, back off, bitch
Back off, back off, bitch
[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2]
Making love, cheap heartbreaker
Broken-backed, nasty ball-breaker
Stay outta my bed, outta my head
If it's loving you, I'm better off dead
[Chorus]
Now back off, back off, bitch
Down in the gutter, dying in the ditch
You better back off, back off, bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off, back off, bitch
Back off, back off, bitch
[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Emotions ripped, gone on a binge
Light lipped, I said you're off the hinge
Telling lies of such fame and glory
I don't even want to hear your story
[Chorus]
Back off, back off, bitch
Down in the gutter, dying in the ditch
You better back off, back off, bitch
Face of an angel with the love of a witch
Back off, back off, bitch
It's such a pity that you're such a bitch
Back off, back off, bitch
It's time to burn-burn the witch
Back off, back off, bitch
Back off, back off, bitch
Back off, back off, bitch
Back off, back off, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
[Outro]
"Hey, what do you think he's trying to say there, anyway?"
"I think it's something each person's supposed to take in their own special way"
Fucking bitch
