[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Well, she's all geared up, walking down the street
And I can feel the slime, dripping down her sleeve
[Bridge]
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
[Instrumental Break]
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home
[Bridge]
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
[Pre-Chorus]
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore
I never should've asked for...
[Chorus]
Black leather
Black leather
Ooh, black leather
Ow, black leather
[Verse 3]
And you can try to hide, but you won't get far
You can let her in, and you'll start again
[Bridge]
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
Well, you can't refuse an' you just can't choose
What she's gonna do
[Pre-Chorus]
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
Crack, crack, I'm feeling so sore
I never should've asked for...
[Chorus]
Black leather
Oooh, Black leather
Ow, black leather
Ow, black leather
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Black leather
Mmmm
