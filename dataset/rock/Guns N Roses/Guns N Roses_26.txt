[Verse 1]
Been hidin' out and layin' low
It's nothing new to me
Well, you can always find a place to go
If you can keep your sanity
[Pre-Chorus]
They break down the doors and they rape my rights, but
They won't touch me
They scream and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got something I've been building up inside
For so fuckin' long
[Chorus 1]
They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me
[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
Sometimes it's harder to leave
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'
That's when your troubles exceed
[Pre-Chorus]
They push me into a corner just to get me to fight, but
They won't touch me
They preach and yell and fight all night
You can't tell me
I lose my head, I close my eyes
They won't touch me
'Cause I got something I've been building up inside
I'm already gone
[Chorus 2]
They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
They won't break me
[Bridge]
No, no whoa
No, n-n-n-no, no
No, no whoa
No, no no no
Lemme see ya try
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Some people got a chip on their shoulder
And some would say it was me
But I didn't buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave me
So I'd be quick to disagree
[Chorus 1]
They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
I'm fucking innocent
They won't break me
[Chorus 2]
They're out ta get me
They won't catch me
'Cause I'm innocent
[Outro]
So, you can suck me
Take that one to heart
