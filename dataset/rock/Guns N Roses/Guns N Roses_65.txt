[Intro]
Give me a little bit of volume on this
[Verse 1]
You're a heart-breaking soul shaker
I've been told about you
Steamroller, midnight shoulder
A-what they've been saying must be true
[Pre-Chorus]
Red hot mama, velvet charmer
I say time's going to pay your dues
[Chorus]
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
[Verse 2]
Talking jive and poison ivy
You ain't going to cling to me
Man taker, born faker
I ain't so blind I can't see
[Pre-Chorus]
Red hot mama, velvet charmer
I say time's going to pay your dues
[Chorus]
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
[Guitar solo]
[Chorus]
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a, a son of a bitch
Now, you're messing with a son of a bitch
[Outro]
Hahaha
