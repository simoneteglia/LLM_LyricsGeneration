[Verse 1]
I'm like a little bitty kid with a real big mouth
And you're gonna have to catch me if you wanna wash it out
Standin' on the corner
Callin' you names
With my juvenile skills and juvenile games
[Verse 2]
I'm a fast motherfucker
Tell you 'bout it fucker
Fuck with me and I'll fuck your mother
Your sister too
Your best girlfriend
Line 'em up
Put 'em end to end
I stick it in, pull it out
Then I grab your face
And cum in your mouth
[Chorus]
Said, it tastes good, don't it?
Said, it tastes good, and you know it
Said, it tastes good, don't it?
Said, it tastes good, and you know it
[Verse 3]
If you're lookin' for trouble
I'm the one
If you're lookin' for a fight
Then we'll have some fun
Stupid motherfuckers shouldn't have ragged on me
They can't see what I can see
I've been up
I've been down
Kickin' fucking shit all over this town
What they say means nothin' to me
Sweet, sweet taste of victory
[Chorus]
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
God dammit, God dammit, said it tastes good, don't it?
It tastes good, and you know it
Take it away, Slash
[Bridge]
OH YEAH!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
[Outro]
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, and you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
I said it tastes good, motherfucker you know it
I said it tastes good, don't it?
WOOOAAAH, OH YEAH!
