[Chorus]
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said, I don't know what I did, but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose
[Verse 1]
An' now you are blowing smoke, I think you're one big joke
Me? I got to lot to learn an' I am still waiting for the heads to turn
You say I walk a line, fuck, they move it every time
You walk a mile in my shoes and then you tell me 'bout singin' the blues
Ah, well, you get what you pay for and freedom's real high priced
And while your ripping off childrens, somebody's fuckin' your wife
It's never made a difference, it's only how you survive
[Chorus]
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said, I don't know what I did, but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose
[Verse 2]
An' now you ask me why, I said, "It's do or die"
I'll stick it right in your face and then I'll put you in your motherfuckin' place
And you, you can suck my ass an' I think it is so low class
Me? I'm just so concerned, I'm still waitin' for your ass to burn
Oh, you want a confrontation? I'll give you every fuckin' chance
With your verbal masturbation, me? I just like to dance
How's that for provocation? I'm just making a stance
[Bridge]
And I'm tired of the frustration of living inside of your lies
And I am wired on indignation, I said, somebody's got to die
Oh
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I said, I don't know what I did, but I know I gotta move
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
I can't wait here forever, I got too much here to lose
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
Listen motherfucker, you're about to pay your dues
I got the shotgun blues, shotgun blues
If you're goin' up against me then you know you're gonna lose
[Outro]
You think anyone with an I.Q. over 15
Would believe your shit, fuckhead?
Nothing but a fucking pussy
