[Verse 1]
I've got a funny feeling, there's something wrong today
I've got a funny feeling and it won't go away
I've got an itchy finger and there'll be hell to pay
I'm gonna pull the trigger and blow them all away
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don't ever try to tell me how you are there for me
[Chorus]
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
[Verse 2]
I've got a wicked demon, his hunger never fades
I've got an empty feeling, I won't be home today
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me
Don't ever try to tell me how you are there for me
[Chorus]
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
No one is stopping you from a doing what you want to do
No one is stopping you now, stopping you now
[Chorus]
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
I don't believe there's a reason
I don't believe it
