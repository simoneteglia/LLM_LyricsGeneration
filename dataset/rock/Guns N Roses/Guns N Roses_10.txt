[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:47]
[Verse 1]
If I say I don't need anyone, I can say these things to you
'Cause I can turn on anyone just like I've turned on you
I've got a tongue like a razor, a sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors but then you'll do whatever I like
[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene
[Verse 2]
I've seen everything imaginable pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible, honey, you'd be surprised
I'm a sexual innuendo in this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything, you better turn me on tonight
[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene
[Instrumental Break 02:09-03:04]
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene
[Instrumental Break 03:20-04:04]
[Bridge]
I see you standin', standin' on your own
It's such a lonely place for you, for you to be
If you need a shoulder or if you need a friend
I'll be here standing until the bitter end
No one needs the sorrow, no one needs the pain
I hate to see you walking out there, out in the rain
So, don't chastise me or think I, I mean you harm
Of those that take you, leave you strung out much too far
Baby, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, baby, yeah
[Instrumental Break 05:31-05:49]
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Don't ever leave me, say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted was for you to know that I care
