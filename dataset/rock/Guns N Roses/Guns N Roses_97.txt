[Intro: Duff McKagan]
Yo, check it out
Huh
[Verse 1: Duff McKagan]
Dance to the beat of the living dead
Lose sleep, baby, stay away from bed
Raw power is sure to come running to you
If you're alone and you got the fear
So am I, baby, let's move out of here
Raw power is sure to come running to you
[Chorus: Axl Rose & Duff McKagan]
Raw power's got a magic touch
Raw power is much too much
Happiness is a-guaranteed
It was made for you and me
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power, hear it, can't be spared
Popping eyes and a flashing feet
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
And you know that ain't right
[Verse 2: Axl Rose & Duff McKagan]
Look in the eyes of the southern girl
Fall deep in love in the underworld
Raw power is sure to come running to you
If you're alone and you got the shakes
So am I, baby, I got what it takes
Raw power is sure to come running to you
[Chorus: Axl Rose & Duff McKagan]
Raw power's got a healing hand
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power is so more than soul
Got a son called rock and roll
Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power honey, give me a spin
Get up, baby, and kiss my feet
Everybody always tryna tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody always tryna tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Raw power it's got no place to go
Raw power, honey, it don't want to know
Raw power is a guaranteed O.D
Raw power is a laughing at you and me
[Guitar Solo: Duff McKagan]
I want to know
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Raw power
Raw power
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
