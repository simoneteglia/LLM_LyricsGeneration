[Intro: Izzy Stradlin]
He lost his mind today
He left it out back on the highway
I-65
[Verse 1: Izzy Stradlin]
She loved him yesterday
Yesterday's over, I said, "Okay, that's alright"
Time moves on, that's the way
We live in hope to see the next day, but that's alright
[Chorus: Axl Rose
with Izzy Stradlin
]
Sometimes, these things, they are so easy
Sometimes, these things, they are so cold
Sometimes, these things just seem to rip you right in two
Oh no, man, don't let 'em get to you
Oh yeah, ow, yeah
[Verse 2: Izzy Stradlin]
She loved him yesterday
He laid her sister, she said, "Okay, that's alright"
Buried her things today
Way back out, deep behind the driveway and that's alright
[Chorus: Axl Rose
with Izzy Stradlin
]
Sometimes, these women are so easy
Sometimes, these women are so cold
Sometimes, these women seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let 'em get to you
Oh, oh yeah
[Bridge: Axl Rose with Izzy Stradlin]
Get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you forget about your home
And then you're just fucking gone
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Izzy Stradlin]
There's no logic here, today
Do as you got to, go your own way, I said, that's right
Time's short, your life's your own
And in the end, we are just
[Outro: Izzy Stradlin,
Axl Rose
