[Verse 1]
I text a postcard sent to you, did it go through?
Sendin' all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life every night
Givin' all my love to you
[Chorus]
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you
[Verse 2]
With every breath that I am worth here on Earth
I'm sendin' all my love to you
So if you dare to second-guess, you can rest
Assured that all my love's for you
[Chorus]
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sendin' all my love to you
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
My beatin' heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
Did I ever make it through?
