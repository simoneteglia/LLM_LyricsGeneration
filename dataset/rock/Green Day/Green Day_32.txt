[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
She's an extraordinary girl
In an ordinary world
And she can't seem to get away
He lacks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain
[Chorus]
She's all alone again
Wipin' the tears from her eyes
Some days, he feels like dyin'
She gets so sick of cryin'
[Verse 2]
She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
He steals the image in her kiss
From her heart's apocalypse
From the one called Whatsername
[Chorus]
She's all alone again
Wipin' the tears from her eyes
Some days, he feels like dyin'
She gets so sick of crying
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
She's all alone again
Wipin' the tears from her eyes
Some days, he feels like dyin'
Some days, it's not worth tryin'
Now that they both are findin'
She gets so sick of cryin'
[Outro]
She's an extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
