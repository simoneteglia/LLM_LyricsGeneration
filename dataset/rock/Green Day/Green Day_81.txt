[Verse 1]
Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
No one really knows about your soul
And I barely really know your name
Burning rhythms and posting lies
And a bunch of fools drown in shame
[Chorus]
Amy, don't you go, I want you around
Singing whoa, oh, oh-ooh-oh-ooh, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
[Verse 2]
Did you tattoo a lucky charm
To keep you out of harm's way?
Warding off all evil signs
But never really kept you safe
Now you're too young for the golden age
'Cause the record bin's been replaced
Twenty-seven, gone without a trace
And you walked away from your drink
[Chorus]
Amy, don't you go, I want you around
Singing whoa, oh, oh-ooh-oh-ooh, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of...
[Bridge]
Amy, please don't go...
Amy, please don't go...
[Verse 3]
Is your heart singing out of tune?
Are your eyes just singing the blues?
Dirty records from another time
Some blood stains on your shoes
May I have this last dance
By chance, if we should meet?
Can you write me a lullaby
So we can sing you to sleep?
[Chorus]
Amy, don't you go, I want you around
Singing whoa, oh, oh-ooh-oh-ooh, please don't go
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
