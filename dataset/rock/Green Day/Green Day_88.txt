[Verse 1]
I lost my way, oh, baby, this stray heart
Went to another
Can you recover, baby?
Oh, you're the only one that I'm dreamin' of
Your precious heart was torn apart by me
[Pre-Chorus]
And you, you're not alone, oh-oh
And now, I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh-oh
I'll hold your heart and never let go
[Chorus]
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you
[Verse 2]
I said a thousand times, and now a thousand one
We'll never part
I'll never stray again from you
This dog is destined for a home to your heart
We'll never part
I'll never stray again from you
[Pre-Chorus]
You're not alone, oh-oh
And now I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh-oh
I'll hold your heart and never let go
[Chorus]
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
You're not alone, oh-oh
And now, I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh-oh
I'll hold your heart and never let go
[Chorus]
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just... just can't have you
