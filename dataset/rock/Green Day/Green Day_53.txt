[Verse 1]
I've been waitin' a long time
For this moment to come, I'm
Destined for anything at all
Downtown, lights will be shinin'
On me, like a new diamond ring out
Under the midnight hour
Well, no one can touch me now, well
And I can't turn my back, it's too late
Ready or not at all
[Chorus]
Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up!
[Verse 2]
Dawning of a new era calling
Don't let it catch ya falling
Ready or not at all
Oh, so close enough to taste it
Almost, I can embrace this feelin'
On the tip of my tongue
[Chorus]
Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up!
[Post-Chorus]
Better thank your lucky stars!
Say, hey, hey!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up!
[Post-Chorus]
You better thank your lucky stars!
Say, hey, hey!
[Outro]
I've been waiting a lifetime
For this moment to come, I'm
Destined for anything at all
Dumbstruck, color me stupid
Good luck, you're gonna need it
Where I'm going, if I get there at all
Wake up!
You better thank your lucky stars!
