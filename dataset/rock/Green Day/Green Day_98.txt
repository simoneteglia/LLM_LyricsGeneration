[Verse 1]
Baby infidel in a dirty magazine
Telling dirty lies, everybody can see
Kick it in the head and now I wanna see you dead
With a switchblade edge to the chest
[Chorus]
I wanna stab you in the heart
I wanna stab you in the heart
Right in the bloody, bloody heart, ooh
For heaven's sake, you're just a fake
And you know it ain't right
[Verse 2]
Pictures don't lie when you're front-page news
Dagger to the heart coming down on you
[Chorus]
I wanna stab you in the heart
I wanna stab you in the heart
Right in the bloody, bloody heart, ooh
For heaven's sake, you're just a fake
Girl, you know it ain't right
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Daggers in my eyes and a rusty tambourine
Gimme my stiletto, gonna do some surgery
[Chorus]
Right to the heart (In the bloody, oh, in the bloody)
I wanna stab you in the heart (In the bloody, oh, in the bloody)
Right in the bloody, bloody heart, ooh (In the bloody, oh, in the bloody)
For heaven's sake, you're just a fake
And you know it ain't right
