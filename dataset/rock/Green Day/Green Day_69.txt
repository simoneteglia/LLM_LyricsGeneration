[Verse 1]
I sit alone in my bedroom
Starin' at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speedin', my love is yearnin'
[Chorus]
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
Years away!
[Verse 2]
I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter, we laugh together
[Chorus]
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
Years away!
[Verse 1]
I sit alone in my bedroom
Starin' at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speedin', my love is yearnin'
[Chorus]
I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
She holds my malachite so tight, oh
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
Years away!
