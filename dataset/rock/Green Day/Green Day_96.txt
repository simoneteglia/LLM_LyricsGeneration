[Intro]
Ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives
Tomorrow is too late to pretend everything's alright, now
I'm not gettin' any younger as long as you don't get any older
I'm not gonna say that yesterday never was
[Pre-Chorus]
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Makin' your mascara bleed
Tears down your face, leavin' traces of my mistakes
When I say
[Chorus]
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
[Verse 2]
I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth
And nothin' but that truth is what I'll ever hear from you, now
Trust is a dirty word that comes from such a liar
But respect is something I will learn if you have faith
[Pre-Chorus]
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep
Makin' your mascara bleed
Tears down your face, leavin' traces of my mistakes
When I say
[Chorus]
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
[Bridge]
Let's go!
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
If I promise go to church on Sunday
Will you go with me on Friday night?
If you live with me, I'll die for you and this compromise
And this compromise
Yes, I'll compromise
