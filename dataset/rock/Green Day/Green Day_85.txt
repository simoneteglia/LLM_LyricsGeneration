[Verse 1]
He hit the ground running
At the speed of light
His star is brightly shining
Like a neon light
[Chorus]
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
[Verse 2]
A fixture on the talk shows
To the silver screen
From here to Colorado
He's a sex machine!
[Chorus]
He's your favorite son
He's your favorite son
[Post-Chorus]
But isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
It's pretty, but it's sad
But isn't it a drag?
[Verse 3]
A clean-cut all-American
Really ain't so clean
His royal auditorium
Is a murder scene!
[Chorus]
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
[Post-Chorus]
But isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
It's pretty, but it's sad
But isn't it a drag?
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Well, no one says it's fair
Turning teenage lust
To a millionaire
[Verse 4]
Now where's your fucking champion?
On a panty raid
He's not the all-American
That you thought you paid
[Chorus]
He's your favorite son
He's your favorite son
[Outro]
But isn't it a drag?
