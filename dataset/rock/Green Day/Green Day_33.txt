[Verse 1]
This is a public service announcement, this is only a test
Emergency evacuation protest
May impair your ability to operate machinery
Can't quite tell just what it means to me
Keep out of reach of children,
don't you talk to strangers
Get your philosophy from a bumper sticker
[Chorus]
Warnin', live without warnin'
I said, "Warnin', live without warnin'"
Without, alright
[Verse 2]
Better homes and safety-sealed communities
Did you remember to pay the utility?
Caution: Police line, you better not cross
Is the cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?
Sanitation,
expiration date, question everything
Or shut up and be a victim of authority
[Chorus]
Warnin', live without warnin'
I said, "Warnin', live without warnin'"
I said, "Warnin', live without warnin'"
I said, "Warnin', live without warnin'"
Without, alright
[Verse 2]
Better homes and safety-sealed communities
Did you remember to pay the utility?
Caution: Police line, you better not cross
Is the cop or am I the one that's really dangerous?
Sanitation,
expiration date, question everything
Or shut up and be a victim of authority
[Chorus]
Warnin', live without warnin'
I said, "Warnin', live without warnin'"
I said, "Warnin', live without warnin'"
I said, "Warnin', live without warnin'"
[Outro]
This is a public service announcement, this is only a test
