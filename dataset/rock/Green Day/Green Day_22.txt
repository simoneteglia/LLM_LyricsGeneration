[Verse 1]
Seventeen, and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a role of disillusion
[Chorus]
I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand
[Verse 2]
Secrets collecting dust, but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet
[Chorus]
I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand
What's happening to me?
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 3]
Seventeen, and coming clean for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time
[Chorus]
I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand
What's happening to me?
