[Verse 1]
Take away the sensation inside
Bittersweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbin' toothache of the mind
I can't take this feelin' anymore
[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
[Verse 2]
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feelin' that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than here
I'll tell you why
[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
Oh, Novacaine
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything'll be alright
Tell me, Jimmy, I won't feel a thing
So give me Novacaine
