[Intro]
Hey, Gloria, are you standing close to the edge?
Look out to the setting sun, the brink of your vision
Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
The cracks of my skin can prove, as the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire, we're gonna start a war
Your slogan's a gun for hire, it's what we waited for...
Hey, Gloria, this is why we're on the edge
The fight of our lives' been drawn to this undying love
[Chorus]
Gloria! ¡Viva la Gloria!
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls
Fallin' in broken glass that's slashing through your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd!
Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth!
[Bridge]
She smashed her knuckles into winter (
Gloria!
)
As autumn's wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners
(
Gloria!
)
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away your burnin' light!
[Chorus]
Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
Don't lose your faith to your lost naiveté
Weather the storm, and don't look back on last November
When your banners were burnin' down!
Gloria!
¡Viva la Gloria!
Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted
Bring us the season that we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out!
[Outro]
So, Gloria, send out your message of
The light that shadows in the night
Gloria, where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life, your life!
