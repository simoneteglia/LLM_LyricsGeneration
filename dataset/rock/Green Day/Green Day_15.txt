[Verse 1]
Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
[Chorus]
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away, and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
[Verse 2]
Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry ol' Whatshisface?
[Chorus]
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away, and then I took a different path
I remember the face, but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been
[Guitar Solo]
[Breakdown]
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
(Remember, whatever)
The regrets are useless in my mind
(It seems like forever ago)
She's in my head, I must confess
(Remember, whatever)
The regrets are useless in my mind
(It seems like forever ago)
She's in my head, so long ago
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go
[Outro]
And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
Forgetting you, but not the time
