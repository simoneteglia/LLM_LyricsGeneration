[Verse 1]
All brawn and no brains, yeah, and all those nice things, yeah
You finally got what you want
Someone to look good with and light your cigarette
Is this what you really want?
[Chorus]
I figured out what you're all about, and
I don't think I like what I see, so
I hope I won't be there in the end if you come around
[Verse 2]
How long will he last before he's a creep in the past
And you're alone once again?
Will you pop up again and be my special friend
'Til the end and when will that be?
[Chorus]
I figured out what you're all about, and
I don't think I like what I see, so
I hope I won't be there in the end if you come around
[Interlude]
Hey!
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I figured out what you're all about, and
I don't think I like what I see, so
I hope I won't be there in the end if you come around
