[Verse 1]
Concrete dream (Hey!)
I'm gonna make a scene
Radio covered in gasoline
Sleepin' in reverse, and everybody's bouncin' off the walls
Bombs away (Hey!)
It's just another day of idle threats
The secret alphabet
I wouldn't sweat it, everybody's bouncin' off the walls
(I'm bouncin' off the walls!)
[Interlude]
Alright
[Verse 2]
Concrete kiss (Hey!)
Come on and do the twist
The radio, my little exorcist
We're all gettin' pissed, and everybody's bouncin' off the walls
(I'm bouncin' off the walls!)
[Chorus]
'Cause it's all that I want, and I wanna be free
I got Satan ridin' next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks, and we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
[Post-Chorus]
Hey!
Hey!
[Chorus]
'Cause it's all that I want, and I wanna be free
I got Satan ridin' next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks, and we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
[Post-Chorus]
Hey!
Hey!
