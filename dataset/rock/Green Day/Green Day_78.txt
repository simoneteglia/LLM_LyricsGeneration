[Intro]
Head down! Head down! Head down!
Do you understand me?!
Aw shit!
[Verse 1]
Waitin' in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged up to a chair
It's so unfair
I don't dare to move
For the pain she puts me through is what I need
So make it bleed
[Chorus]
I'm in distress
Oh, mistress, I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me
[Post-Chorus]
Say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called "Kill"
[Verse 2]
My head is in the gutter
Thank you, sir, strike up another mandolin
Of discipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh down to the wood
It feels so good
[Chorus]
I'm in distress
Oh, mistress, I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me
[Post-Chorus]
Say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned
From a girl called "Kill"
[Bridge]
Ch... Whoo!
Whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
I'm in distress
Oh, mistress, I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me
[Outro]
Ah! Whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh
I'll show you a real time!
