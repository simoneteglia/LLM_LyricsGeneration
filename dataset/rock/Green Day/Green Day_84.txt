[Verse]
I don't wanna freak you out, but I cannot lie
I don't wanna freak you out, but I cannot lie
So who's holding the drugs? (Woah)
Who's holding the drugs? (Woah)
I don't wanna freak you out, but I cannot lie
[Chorus]
I was a teenage teenager
Full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager
I am alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers
[Verse]
I don't wanna freak you out, but I cannot lie
I don't wanna freak you out, but I cannot lie
So who's holding the drugs? (Woah)
Who's holding the drugs? (Woah)
I don't wanna freak you out, but I cannot lie
[Chorus]
I was a teenage teenager
Full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
I was a teenage teenager
I am alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
I was a teenage teenager (I was a teenage teenager)
Full of piss and vinegar
Living like a prisoner for haters
(I was a teenager)
I was a teenage teenager (Teenager)
I am alien visitor
My life's a mess and school is just for suckers
