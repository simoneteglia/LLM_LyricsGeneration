[Verse 1]
Your rise and fall back up against the wall
What goes around is coming back and haunting you
It's time to quit 'cause you ain't worth the shit
Under my shoes, or the piss on the ground
[Pre-Chorus]
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you wanna hear
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
[Verse 2]
I heard you're sick, sucked on that cancer stick
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high
Shit out of luck, and now your time is up
It brings me pleasure just to know you're going to die
[Pre-Chorus]
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you wanna hear
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
[Bridge]
Dickhead, fuckface, cock-smokin', motherfuckin'
Asshole, dirty twat, waste of semen, hope you die, hey!
[Verse 3]
Red eye,
code blue,
I'd like to strangle you
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull
When you go down headfirst into the ground
I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave
[Pre-Chorus]
No one loves you and you know it
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care
'Cause now I wouldn't lie
Or tell you all the things you wanna hear
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
'Cause I hate you!
