[Verse 1]
Do as I say, not as I do
Because the shit's so deep, you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
Agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I'll hit you again
A smart ass, but I'm playing dumb
[Verse 2]
Standards set and broken all the time
Control the chaos behind the gun
Call it as I see it, even if
I was born deaf, blind, and dumb
Losers winning big on the lottery
Rehab rejects still sniffing glue
Constant refutation with myself
A victim of a catch-22
[Chorus]
I have no belief
But I believe I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right
[Verse 1]
Do as I say, not as I do
Because the shit's so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
Agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I'll hit you again
A smart ass, but I'm playing dumb
[Chorus]
I have no belief
But I believe I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right
I have no belief
But I believe I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right
[Outro]
Ay!
