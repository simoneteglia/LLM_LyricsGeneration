[Intro]
She
puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
She is paranoid, endangered species headed into extinction
She is one of a kind, well she's the last of the American girls
[Verse 1]
She wears her overcoat for the coming of the nuclear winter
She is riding her bike like a fugitive of Critical Mass
She's on a hunger strike for the ones who won't make it for dinner
She makes enough to survive for a holiday of workin' class
[Chorus]
She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated
She won't cooperate, well she's the last of the American girls
[Verse 2]
She plays her vinyl records, singin' songs on the eve of destruction
She's a sucker for all the criminals breakin' the laws
She will come in first for the end of western civilization
She's an endless war, she's a hero for the lost cause
[Chorus]
Like a hurricane in the heart of the devastation
She's a natural disaster, she's the last of the American girls
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
She puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
She will come in first for the end of western civilization
She's a natural disaster, she's the last of the American girls
[Outro]
Aw, yeah
Alright
Aw, yeah
