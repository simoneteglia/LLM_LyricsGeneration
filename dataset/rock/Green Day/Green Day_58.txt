[Intro]
Oh (Yeah)
'Kay, I got it
[Verse 1]
I'm in the crowd full of angels and demons
I'm looking out for the jingoes and heathens
Nobody move and nobody gonna get hurt
Reach for the sky with your face in the dirt (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Everybody is a star (Star)
Got my money and I'm feeling kinda low (Feeling kinda low)
Everybody got a scar (Scar)
Ain't it funny how we're running out of hope?
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody, e-everybody)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Oh)
[Verse 2]
I got blood on my hands in my pockets
That's what you get turning bullets into rockets (Rock—)
I am a kid of a bad education
The shooting star of a lowered expectation
[Chorus]
Everybody is a star (Star)
Got my money and I'm feeling kinda low (Feeling kinda low)
Everybody got a scar (Scar)
Ain't it funny how we're running out of hope?
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody, e-everybody)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Oh)
[Verse 3]
I'm just a face in the crowd of spectators
To the sound of the voice of a traitor
Dirty looks and I'm looking for a payback
Burning books in a bulletproof backpack
[Chorus]
Everybody is a star (Star)
Got my money and I'm feeling kinda low (Feeling kinda low)
Everybody got a scar (Scar)
Ain't it funny how we're running out of hope?
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody, e-everybody)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Oh)
[Outro]
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody is a star)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Everybody is a star, ow)
