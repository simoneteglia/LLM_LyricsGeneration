[Verse 1]
I'm all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
Accidents will happen
But this time, I can't get up
She comes to check on me
Making sure I'm on my knees
After all, she's the one
Who put me in this state
[Chorus]
Is she ultra-violent? Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh God, she's killin' me
[Verse 2]
For now, I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep sayin' my love is true
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Is she ultra-violent? Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh God, she's killin' me
[Bridge]
Lookin' out my window for someone that's passin' by
No one knows I'm locked in here, all I do is cry
[Verse 2]
For now, I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep sayin' my love is true
