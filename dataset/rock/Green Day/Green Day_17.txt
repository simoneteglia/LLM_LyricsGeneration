[Intro: Kathleen Hanna]
Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you, having fun
[Verse: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collectin' unemployment checks
A flunky only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fuckin' match to light this fuse
[Pre-Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standin' still when it's do or die
You better run for your fuckin' life
[Chorus]
It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burnin', it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothin' left to analyze
[Bridge]
Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go when it's too late?
And don't look back
[Pre-Chorus]
You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burning, it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
[Outro]
Well, she said, "I can't take this place
I'm leavin' it behind"
Well, she said, "I can't take this town
I'm leavin' you tonight"
