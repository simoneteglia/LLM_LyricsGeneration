[Verse 1]
I woke up to a message of love
Choking up on the smoke from above
I'm obsessed with the poison and us
What a mess 'cause there's no one to trust
[Pre-Chorus]
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Huh-uh, count your money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
There's a riot living inside of us
[Chorus]
I got paranoia, baby
And it's so hysterical
I'm crackin' up under the pressure
Looking for a miracle
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lyin' in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us
Uh-huh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm impressed with the presence of none
I'm possessed from the heat of the sun
Hurry up 'cause I'm making a fuss
Fingers up 'cause there's no one to trust
[Pre-Chorus]
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Huh-uh, count your money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
There's a riot living inside of us
[Chorus]
I got paranoia, baby
And it's so hysterical
I'm crackin' up under the pressure
Looking for a miracle
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lyin' in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us
[Outro]
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lyin' in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us
Huh-uh, come on, honey
Lyin' in a bed of blood and money
Huh-uh, what's so funny?
We are rivals in the riot inside us
Uh-huh, yeah
