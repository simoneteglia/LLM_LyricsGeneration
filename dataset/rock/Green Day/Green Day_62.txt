[Verse 1]
I'm making an offer that you cannot deny
You won't be laughing when I'm making you cry
'Cause, ayy-oh! I hear the pleas get louder
You son of a bitch, you're gonna beg and cower
[Pre-Chorus]
Vendetta is a friend of mine
Revenge is sweeter than wine
I never asked to hear your god-damned feelings
Get on your knees when you are kissing my ring
[Chorus]
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
[Verse 2]
Well, I can remember all the bad memories
I never forget a face that's quite so ugly
Ayy-oh! Lost yеars are wasted
I always liked you, but I'm glad that you'rе all dead
[Pre-Chorus]
Vendetta is a friend of mine
Revenge is sweeter than wine
I never asked to hear your god-damned feelings
Get on your knees when you are kissing my ring
[Chorus]
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I'm making an offer that you cannot deny
You won't be laughing when I'm making you cry
'Cause, ayy-oh! I hear the pleas get louder
You son of a bitch, you're gonna beg and cower
[Chorus]
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
Bada bing, bada bing, bada boom
