[Intro]
Fuck...
[Verse 1]
Another turnin' point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
[Chorus]
It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
[Verse 2]
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while
[Chorus]
It's somethin' unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
[Violin Solo]
[Chorus]
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
