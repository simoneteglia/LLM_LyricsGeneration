Ah
Ooh
[Verse 1]
Kick the dog when the whistle blows
Well, you're a liar (Ah)
Feed the creeps with a stick and bone
You're a liar (Ah)
Baby got the hyperbole (Ah)
Baby got the hyperbole (Ooh)
Kick the dog when the whistle blows
Well, you're a liar (Ah)

Rip it up on retribution
Turn it up sideways (Ah)

Ready, aim, fire, fire, ready, aim
Ready, aim, fire, fire, ready, aim

Stick a hammer in your mouth
You're a liar (Ah)
Knock your teeth out to the ground
Well, you're a liar (Ah)
Baby got the hyperbole (Ah)
Baby got the hyperbole (Ooh)
Knock your teeth out to the ground
Well, you're a liar (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Rip it up on retribution
Turn it up sideways (Ah)
[Chorus]
Ready, aim, fire, fire, ready, aim
Ready, aim, fire, fire, ready, aim
[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Ready, aim, fire, fire, ready, aim
Ready, aim, fire, fire, ready, aim
