[Verse 1]
What good is love and peace on Earth
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?
[Pre-Chorus]
A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don't think twice
[Chorus]
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
[Verse 2]
What part of history we've learned
When it's repeated?
Some things, we'll never overcome
If we don't seek it
[Pre-Chorus]
The world stops turning
Paradise burning
So don't think twice
[Chorus]
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
We live in troubled times
[Bridge]
We run for cover
Like a skyscraper's fallin' down
And then I wonder
Like a troubled mind
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
What good is love and peace on Earth
When it's exclusive?
Where's the truth in the written word
If no one reads it?
[Pre-Chorus]
A new day dawning
Comes without warning
So don't look twice
[Chorus]
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
We live in troubled times
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
We live in troubled times (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
We live in troubled times
