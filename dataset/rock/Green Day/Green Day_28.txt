[Verse 1]
I declare I don't care no more
I'm burnin' up and out and growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shaggin' in my eyes
Draggin' my feet to hit the street tonight
Drive along these shit town lights
[Chorus]
I'm not growin' up, I'm just burnin' out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
[Verse 2]
Oh, apathy has rained on me
And now I'm feelin' like a soggy dream
So close to drowning, but I don't mind
I'll live inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
And hell, who needs 'em anyway?
[Chorus]
I'm not growin' up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm not growin' up, I'm just burnin' out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
Dead (Hoo!)
[Drum Solo]
[Chorus]
I'm not growin' up, I'm just burnin' out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm not growin' up, I'm just burnin' out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
Dead
