[Chorus]
I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority
[Verse 1]
I pledge allegiance to the underworld
One nation under dog, there of which, I stand alone
A face in the crowd unsung against the mold
Without a doubt,
singled out
, the only way I know
[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority
[Bridge]
Stepped out of the line
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Marchin' out of time
To my own beat, now
The only way I know
[Verse 2]
One light, one mind flashin' in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For cryin' out loud," she screamed unto me
A free-for-all, fuck 'em all, you are your own sight
[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority (Hey!)
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
One light, one mind, flashin' in the dark
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
"For cryin' out loud," she screamed unto me
A free-for-all, fuck 'em all, you are your own sight
[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be the minority
I don't need your authority
Down with the moral majority
'Cause I wanna be the minority
[Outro]
(I wanna be) The minority
(I wanna be) The minority
(I wanna be) The minority
(I wanna be) The minority!
