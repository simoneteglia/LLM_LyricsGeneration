[Intro]
Dreamin', I was only dreamin'
Of another place and time, where my family's from
Singin', I can hear them singin'
When the rain had washed away all these scattered dreams
Dyin', everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery, drenched in gasoline
Laughter, there is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday now live in the underground...
[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
Life before the lobotomy
Christian sang the eulogy
Signed, "My love," a lost memory
From the end of the century
[Chorus]
Well, it's enough to make you sick
To cast a stone and throw a brick
But when the sky is falling down
You burned your dreams into the ground
[Verse 2]
Christian's lesson's what he's been sold (Hey!)
We are normal and self-controlled (Hey!)
Remember to learn to forget (Hey!)
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes
[Chorus]
Well, I'm not stoned, I'm just fucked up
I got so high I can't stand up
Well, I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed
I'm not in love, 'cause I'm a mess
[Bridge]
Like refugees (Too late)
We're lost like refugees (Too late)
Like refugees (Too late)
We're lost like refugees (Too late)
The brutality of reality
Is the freedom that keeps me from...
[Outro]
Dreamin', I was only dreamin'
Of another place and time, where my family's from
Singin', I can hear them singin'
When the rain had washed away all these scattered dreams
Dyin', everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery, drenched in gasoline
Laughter, there is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday now live in the underground...
