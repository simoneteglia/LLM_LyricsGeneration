[Verse 1]
We're livin' in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routine's turnin' to contention
Like a production line goin' over and over and over, roller coaster
[Chorus]
Now I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
[Verse 2]
Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous
Taken for granted, now I've wasted and faked it, ate it, now I hate it
[Chorus]
'Cause I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Now I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
Now I cannot speak
I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant 'cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
