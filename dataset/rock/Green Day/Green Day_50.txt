[Part I: I'm Freaking Out]
[Verse 1]
My name is Billie, and I'm freakin' out
I thought, therefore I was, well I can't really figure it out
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers
Scream out my memories as if I was never there
[Chorus]
Standing at the edge of the world
Is givin' me the chills
But lookin' down the edge of the world
I'm lost in a tango, it's freakin' me out
Burnin' lights and blackouts
[Post-Chorus]
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
[Verse 2]
I'm like a punk rocker on Labor Day
How the hell did I work so hard to be born this way?
I never learned to read or write so well (Freakin' out)
But I can play the guitar until it hurts like hell
[Chorus]
Standing at the edge of the world
Is givin' me the chills
But lookin' down the edge of the world
I'm lost in a tango, it's freakin' me out
Burnin' lights and blackouts
[Post-Chorus]
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
(Out, out, out) From the edge of the world!
[Part II: A Better Way to Die]
[Intro]
If this is what you call the good life (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I want a better way to die
If this is what you call the good life (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I want a better way to die
[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't wanna think about tomorrow
Don't wanna think about the old
It doesn't matter anyway
Oh, I, I wanna start a revolution
I wanna hear it on my radio
I'll put it off another day
[Bridge]
I want a new conspiracy
And the silence of a thousand cries
So hurry up, I want a better way to die
[Part III: Somewhere Now (Reprise)]
[Verse 4]
I'm runnin' late to somewhere now
That I don't want to be
Where the future and promises
Ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise
Or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side
Ever get so full?
[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I (Ooh, somewhere now)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
(Ooh, somewhere now)
Don't wanna think about the old
(Ooh, somewhere now)
It doesn't matter anyway
(Ooh, somewhere now)
Oh, I (Ooh, somewhere now)
I wanna start a revolution
(Ooh, somewhere now)
I wanna hear it on my radio
(Ooh, somewhere now)
I'll put it off another day
(Ooh, somewhere now)
[Bridge]
Oh, I (Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Don't wanna think about tomorrow
(Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Don't wanna think about the old
(Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
It doesn't matter anyway
(Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
Oh, I (Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
I wanna start a revolution
(Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
I wanna hear it on my radio
(Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)
I'll put it off another day
(Ooh, somewhere now)
(I ain't gonna stand in line no more)

[Outro]
Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah
