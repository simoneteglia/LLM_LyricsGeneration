[Chorus]
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
[Verse]
Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy, rah-eh!
Bringin' on the fury, the choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
Well, burnin' down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
And silence is an enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
[Chorus]
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
[Bridge]
The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes
Say!
[Guitar Solo]
Oh-eh-oh-eh!
Oh-eh-oh-eh!
[Breakdown]
Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, from here to eternity (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, silence is the enemy, so gimme, gimme revolution!
[Chorus]
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
[Outro]
(Do you know the enemy?)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
Well, burnin' down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
(Do you know the enemy?)
Silence is an enemy, against your urgency
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
So rally up the demons of your soul! (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
