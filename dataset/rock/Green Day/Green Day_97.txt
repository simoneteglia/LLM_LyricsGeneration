[Verse 1]
High on a low life
Hit me with a dull knife
Sweet soul sickness
Can I get a witness?
[Chorus]
This is the wild life, I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say "please" when I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl
[Verse 2]
Illegal tender
Goin' on a bender
Cold-blooded killers
Of all motherfuckers
[Chorus]
Well, I'm a nervous wreck, enough to make you sick
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah, it's just my luck, but I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl
[Interlude]
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
[Chorus]
This is the wild life, I'm gonna take a dive
Take the money and crawl
Do I dare say "please" when I'm on my knees?
Take the money and crawl
So you can take a walk, or you can suck my cock
Take the money and crawl
Oh yeah, it's just my luck, but I don't give a fuck
Take the money and crawl
