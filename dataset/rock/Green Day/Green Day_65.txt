[Intro]
One, two, three, four!
[Verse 1]
Well, I've got a fever, a non-believer,
I'm in a state of grace
For I am the Caesar, I'm gonna seize the day (Ay, ay-ay)
Well, call of the banshee, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
As God as my witness, the infidels are gonna pay
Well, call the assassin, the orgasm, a spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us? The righteous and the meek (Ay, ay-ay)
Well, call of the wild, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Well, death to the girl at the end of the serenade
[Chorus]
Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire, and the desire
Well, shots ringin' out on the holy parasite
[Verse 2]
Well, I am a killjoy from Detroit, I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love (Ah, ah-ah)
Well, call up the captain, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Well, death to the lover that you were dreamin' of
Well, this is a stand-off, a Molotov cocktail's on the house
You thought I was a write-off, you better think again (Ay, ay-ay)
Well, call the peacemaker, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began
[Chorus]
Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire, and the desire
Well, shots ringin' out on the holy parasite
[Interlude]
[Breakdown]
Well, now the caretaker's the undertaker
So I'm gonna go out and get a peacemaker
This is a Neo Saint Valentine's massacre (Ah, ah-ah)
Well, call up the Gaza, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
