[Verse 1]
Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it
[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
[Verse 2]
I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down
[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Huh yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh! Ooh!)
[Bridge]
Grasping to control
So I better hold on
[Chorus]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
