[Chorus]
The American Dream is killin' me
The American Dream is killin' me
When it's all double-talk of conspiracy
The American dream is killin' me
[Verse 1]
Send out an S.O.S.​​
It's gettin' serious
Bulldoze your family home
Now it's a condo
[Pre-Chorus]
We are not home
Are we not home?
Goddamn, I am so grateful
Forever faithful to
[Chorus]
The American Dream is killin' me
The American Dream is killin' me
[Bridge]
People on the street
Unemployed and obsolete
Did you ever learn to read the ransom note?
[Verse 2]
Don't want no huddled masses
TikTok and taxes
Under the overpass
Sleepin' in broken glass
[Pre-Chorus]
We are not well
Are we not well?
Cracked up into the wild
We're pedophiles for
[Chorus]
The American Dream is killin' me
The American Dream is killin' me
When it's all double-talk of insanity
The American Dream is killin' me
Say!
[Interlude]
Woah, oh, oh oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh oh-oh
Cha!
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
From sea to shinin' sea
Whitewashed upon the beach
My country under siege
On private property
[Pre-Chorus]
We are not home
Are we not home?
Kiss me, I'm dead inside
Who needs suicide when
[Chorus]
The American Dream is killin' me
The American Dream is killin' me
When it's all double-talk of insanity
The American Dream is killin' me
