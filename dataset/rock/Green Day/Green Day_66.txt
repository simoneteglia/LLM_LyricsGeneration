[Verse 1]
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?
I'll take you to a movie that we've already seen
Or sit at home and watch reruns
There's no other place I'd wanna be

Do you wanna be my boyfriend?
We'll walk the cemetery
And I'll kiss you again
And make our dead friends blush, oh-woah
We'll be getting married right there on the scene
Do you wanna be my best friend?
You can drive me crazy
All ovеr again
And I'll bore you to death, oh woah
Doesn't mattеr when we are in love
