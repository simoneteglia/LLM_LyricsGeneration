[Verse 1]
A thought burst in my head
And I need to tell you
It's news that I forethought
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
I think I just forgot
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's what I'm saying
[Chorus]
There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting
[Verse 2]
I shuffle through my mind
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
Oh well, never mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's what I'm saying
[Chorus]
There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting
[Bridge]
What I'm saying
There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting
[Chorus]
There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting
