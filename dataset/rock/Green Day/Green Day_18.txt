[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong &
Tre Cool
]
St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Lights on the silhouette, he's insubordinate
Comin' at you on the count of one, two
One, two, three, four!
[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
My name is Jimmy, and you better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your momma talked about
King of the forty thieves,
and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong
with Mike Dirnt
]
I'm the
patron saint
of the denial
With an
angel face
and a taste for suicidal
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Cigarettes and ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe
Raised in the city in the halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong
with Mike Dirnt
]
I'm the
patron saint
of the denial
With an
angel face
and a taste for suicidal
[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Are you talkin' to me?
I'll give you somethin' to cry about
Shh! Shh! Shh! St. Jimmy!
[Breakdown: Billie Joe Armstrong]
My name is St. Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
I'm the one that's from the way outside, now
A teenage assassin executing some fun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
In the cult of the life of crime, now
I really hate to say it, but I told you so
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, ol' boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
(Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, St. Jimmy)
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found
[Outro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy, and that's my name
And don't wear it out!
