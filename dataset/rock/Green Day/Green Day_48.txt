band members speaking and laughing

One, two, three...
[Verse 1: Tré Cool]
I was alone
I was all by myself
No one was lookin'
I was thinkin' of you
Oh yeah, did I mention
I was all by myself?
All by myself
All by myself
All by myself
[Verse 2: Tré Cool]
I went to your house
But no one was there
I went in your room
I was all by myself
You and me had
Such wonderful times
When I'm all by myself
All by myself
