[Intro]
Oh-oh, I love you
Oh-oh, I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please don't go away, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
I was a high school atom bomb
Goin' off on the weekends
Smokin' dope and mowin' lawns
And I hated all the new trends
[Pre-Chorus]
Me and my friends sang, "Woah-ooh-whoa-oh-oh" (Whoa-ooh-whoa)
"Here's to the middle of the road
At least it's better than here"
[Chorus]
Lookin' for a cause
Well, all I got was Santa Claus
I'm hangin' on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high (Whoo! Way up high!)
Too scared to dream
But too dumb to die
[Verse 2]
My daddy always was on strike
Goin' off with the teamsters
He said that everything'll be alright
"Not every Sunday can be Easter"
[Pre-Chorus]
The picket line screamed, "Woah-ooh-whoa-oh-oh!" (Whoa-ooh-whoa)
"Don't cross, don't cross the line because
You'll be a scab, not a martyr!"
[Chorus]
Lookin' for a cause
Well, all I got was camouflage
I'm hangin' on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high (Whoo! Way up high!)
Too scared to dream
But too dumb to...
Haha... Hehe... Yeah... Hey!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Lookin' for a cause
Well, all I got was camouflage
I'm hangin' on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high (Whoo! Way up high!)
Too scared to dream
But too dumb to die
