[Verse 1]
Little girl, little girl, why are you cryin'?
Inside your restless soul, your heart is dyin'
Little one, little one, your soul is purgin'
Of love and razor blades, your blood is surgin'
[Chorus]
Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go
[Verse 2]
Little girl, little girl, your life is callin'
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one, little one, the sky is fallin'
Your lifeboat of deception is now sailin'
In the wake (
All the way!
) All the way, no rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes will show your heart of treason
Little girl, little girl, you dirty liar
You're just a junkie preachin' to the choir
[Chorus]
Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go
[Bridge]
The traces of blood always follow you home
Like the mascara tears from your getaway
(
Gloria!
)
You're walkin' with blisters and running with shears
So unholy, sister of grace
[Interlude]
[Outro]
Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray from the Salvation Army
There is no place like home...
