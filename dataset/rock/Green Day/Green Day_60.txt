[Verse 1]
I'm runnin' late to somewhere now
That I don't want to be
Where the future and promises
Ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise
Or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side
Ever get so dull?
[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) I put the "riot" in "patriot"
And we all die in threes
[Verse 2]
I got a seat in the middle of the road
I'm gonna take my time
I shop online so I can vote
At the speed of life
I'm like a drone way up in the sky
I'm a shootin' star
There's a soldier that's freakin' out
P.S. This is war
[Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) I put the "riot" in "patriot"
And we all die in threes
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All we want is money and guns
A new catastrophe
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Here comes nothin', there's nothin' to lose
It's a small price we pay
When we all die in threes
[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh) Somewhere now!
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh) Somewhere now!
[Interlude]
[Outro]
(Ooh) Hallelujah, I found my soul (Ooh)
Under the sofa pillows
(Ooh) Congratulations, I found myself (One, two!)
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
Somewhere now
