[Verse 1]
Somebody keep my balance, I think I'm falling off
Into a state of regression
The expiration date rapidly coming up
It's leaving me behind to rank
[Chorus]
Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
[Verse 2]
I'm taking one step sideways, leading with my crutch
Got a fucked up equilibrium
Count down from 9 to 5, hooray, we're gonna die
Blessed into our distinction
[Chorus]
Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Always move forward
Going straight will get you nowhere
There is no progress, evolution killed it all
I found my place in nowhere
In nowhere, in nowhere
