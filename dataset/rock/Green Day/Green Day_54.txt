[Verse 1]
Where can I find the city of shinin' light
In an ordinary world?
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world?
[Chorus]
The days into years roll by
It's where that I live until I die
Ordinary world
[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, hmm-hmm
[Verse 2]
What would you wish if you saw a shooting star
In an ordinary world?
I'd walk to the end of the Earth, and afar
In an ordinary world
[Chorus]
Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, hmm-hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
Where can I find the city of shinin' light
In an ordinary world?
How can I leave a buried treasure behind
In an ordinary world?
[Chorus]
Baby, I don't have much
But what we have is more than enough
Ordinary world
[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, hmm-hmm
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
