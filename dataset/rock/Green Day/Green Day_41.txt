[Intro]
"Reberu rajio!"
“Loss-”
"¡La última noche!"
“Me-”
"And we will see how Godless a nation we have become."

[Verse 1]
Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized, well
(Stand up!)
All the white boys
(Sit down!)
And the black girls
(Stand up!)
You're the soldiers
(Sit down!)
Of the new world
[Pre-Chorus]
Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir, we'll be singin'
In the church of wishful thinkin'
[Chorus]
A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics
[Verse 2]
Oh, bless me, Lord, for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in the river of a shadow of doubt
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best
[Pre-Chorus]
Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flatterin'?
I never asked you a goddamn thing!
[Chorus]
A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics
[Bridge]
Don't test me
Second-guess me
Protest me, you will disappear
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
The missionary politicians
And the cops of the new religion!
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside
[Outro]
Yeah!
