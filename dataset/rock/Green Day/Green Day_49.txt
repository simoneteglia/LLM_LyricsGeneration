[Intro]
Wow! Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy in the holiest of holes
Onward Christian soldiers filled with jive and mind-control
[Pre-Chorus]
The blood left on the dance floor, running, running red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death unless you—
[Chorus]
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down!"
[Post-Chorus]
We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
The culture wars in your heart and your mind
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Ooh, I'll pick up what's left in the club, a pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gomorrah in the century of thrills
[Pre-Chorus]
The blood left on the dance floor, running, running red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death unless you—
[Chorus]
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Hold him underwater 'til that motherfucker drowns
[Post-Chorus]
We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
The culture wars in your heart and your mind
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Someone's gonna get you, boy
Shoot that fucker down!
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
(Walking after dark)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
(Walking after dark)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
(Walking after dark)
Someone kill the DJ
Shoot that fucker down, wow!
[Chorus]
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Someone kill the DJ (Shoot the fucking DJ)
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down!"
