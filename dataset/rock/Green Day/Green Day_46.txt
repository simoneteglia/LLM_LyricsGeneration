[Verse 1]
Nice guys finish last
You're runnin' out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes you're at your best
When you feel the worst
Do you feel washed up like piss goin' down the drain?
[Pre-Chorus]
Pressure cooker, pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fuckin' happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy
[Chorus]
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
[Verse 2]
Livin' on command
You're shakin' lots of hands
You're kissin' up and bleedin' all your trust
Takin' what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You'll lose your memory, and you got no shame
[Pre-Chorus]
Pressure cooker, pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fuckin' happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth, but now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy
[Chorus]
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Mhm!
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine
