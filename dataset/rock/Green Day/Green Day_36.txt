[Part 1: American Eulogy]
[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Sing us the song of the century
It sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Of forgotten hope and the class of '13
Tell me a story into that good night
Sing us a song for me...
[Part 2: Mass Hysteria]
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics,
and the neighborhood's a loaded gun
Idle thoughts lead to full-throttle screamin'
And the wealth is asphyxiatin'
Mass confusion is all the new rage,
and it's creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of hysteria
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf mute's misleadin' the choir
The punchline is a natural disaster,
and it's sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class war is hangin' on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar
when he said, "It's just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria"
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
There's a disturbance on the oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
The static response is so unclear now
"Mayday, this is not a test"
As the neighborhood burns
America is fallin'
And vigilantes warnin' ya
Callin' Christian and Gloria!
[Guitar Solo]
[Part 3: Modern World]
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
[Verse 3: Mike Dirnt]
Well, I'm the class of '13 in the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul on a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels without a common ground
I'm gonna light a fire into the underground, well
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I am a nation without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it's written, fuckin' lies
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4: Mike Dirnt]
Well, I wanna take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the "up to date" and the neo-gentrified
The high definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of a beatin' heart
It bleeds beyond a system that is fallin' apart
With money to burn on a minimum wage
Well, I don't give a shit about the modern age
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
