[Verse 1]
It started at the age of four
My mother went to the grocery store
Went sneakin' through her bedroom door
To find somethin' in a size four
[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is makin' room for the one and only
[Chorus]
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
[Verse 2]
My daddy threw me in therapy
He thinks I'm not a real man
Who put the drag in the drag queen?
Don't knock it until you've tried it
[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is makin' room for the one and only
[Chorus]
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls
GI Joe in panty hose is makin' room for the one and only
[Chorus]
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
King for a day in a leather thong
King for a day, princess by dawn
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me
