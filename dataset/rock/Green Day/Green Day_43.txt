[Verse 1]
Today's the Macy's Day Parade
The night of the livin' dead is on its way
With a credit report for duty call
It's a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin, ten percent more free
Red light special at the mausoleum
[Chorus]
Can give me somethin' that I need
With satisfaction guaranteed to you
What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope
[Verse 2]
When I was a kid, I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
Oh-oh, but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
A lesson learned to me and you
[Chorus]
Can give me somethin' that I need
With satisfaction guaranteed
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope
Can give me somethin' that I need
With satisfaction guaranteed
'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the only road
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinkin' 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
