[Verse]
Here we go again, infatuation
touches me
Just when I thought that it would end
Oh, but then again it seems much more than that
But I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I toss and turn all night thinking of your ways of affection
But to find that it's not different at all
Well, I throw away my past mistakes and contemplate my future
That's why I say, "What the hey?"
[Chorus]
Would it last forever, with you and I together
Hand and hand, we run away (far away)
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can give that comes my way, yeah
(far away)

Far away
