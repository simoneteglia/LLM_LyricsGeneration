[Verse 1]
Welcome to my problems
It's not an invitation
This is my dilemma
And it's my obsession
[Chorus]
I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
[Verse 2]
Welcome to my nightmare
Where dreams go to disappear
Sit around in rehab
Feeling like a lab rat
Strange days are here again
And it's getting weirder
Here's to all my problems
I just wanna drink the poison
[Chorus]
I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
[Bridge]
Oh, why
When I fall asleep tonight
On the wing and prayer
Oh, why?
For despair and obsession on you?
You, yeah
[Chorus]
I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
I was sober, now I'm drunk again
I'm in trouble and in love again
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
I don't wanna be a dead man walking
