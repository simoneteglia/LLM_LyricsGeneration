[Intro]
This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution
The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions
Described as severely mentally disturbed
It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group
Deserve to be annihilated
[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I get my kicks, and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong
with Mike Dirnt
]
Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (
Ah-ah
)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or gimme head (
Ah-ah
)
Daddy's little psycho, and Mommy's little soldier
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live, and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong
with Mike Dirnt
]
Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (
Ah-ah
)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or gimme head (
Ah-ah
)
Broadcasting from my room and playin' with my toys
[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong
with Mike Dirnt
]
I wanna be a celebrity martyr (
Ah-ah
)
The leadin' man in my own private drama
Hoorah! (
Bang! Bang!
) Hoorah! (
Bang! Bang!
)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho, and Mommy's little soldier
[Breakdown: Billie Joe Armstrong
with Mike Dirnt
]
I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
It's my private movie
(
Holy War!
)
Oh, baby, baby, this is Viva Vendetta
For this is love, or it's
World War Zero!
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
[Drum Solo]
[Outro: Billie Joe Armstrong
with Mike Dirnt
]
I wanna be a celebrity martyr (
Ah-ah
)
The leadin' man in my own private drama
Hoorah! (
Bang! Bang!
) Hoorah! (
Bang! Bang!
)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho, and Mommy's little soldier
I wanna be a celebrity martyr (
Ah-ah
)
The leadin' man in my own private drama
Hoorah! (
Bang! Bang!
) Hoorah! (
Bang! Bang!
)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho, and Mommy's little soldier!
