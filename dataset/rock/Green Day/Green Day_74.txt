[Chorus]
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
Punch drunken youngblood
[Verse 1]
She's a loner, not a stoner
Bleeding heart, and the soul of Ms. Teresa
Supernova, Cherry Cola
She's the cedar in the trees of Minnesota
Ah-ah ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah
[Verse2]
I'm a rough boy 'round the edges
Gettin' drunk, and fallin' into hedges
She's my weakness, fuckin' genius
Swear to God, and I'm not even superstitious
[Chorus]
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
Punch drunken youngblood
[Bridge]
I wanna hold you like a gun
We'll shoot the moon into the sun
(Daylight) Alright (Alright) Alright, ow!
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Are you stranded like I'm stranded?
Do you wanna watch the world fall to pieces?
Are you broken like I'm broken?
Are you restless? She said, "Fuck you, I'm from Oakland!"
[Chorus]
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
She's my little youngblood
Youngblood, youngblood, youngblood
Punch drunken youngblood
