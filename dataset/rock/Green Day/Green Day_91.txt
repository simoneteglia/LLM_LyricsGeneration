[Verse 1]
What are the symptoms of our happiness and civil war?
Mano y mano in the stereo without a cure
I've got a fever, a non-believer, and it's killing me
Like a high school loser that will never ever, ever, ever
fuck the prom queen
[Chorus]
I got the shakes and I'm on fire
I got a feeling and it's dangerous
Gonna dance to something wild
I got a feeling and I need a rush
All hell is breaking loose and Heaven only knows
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo, no
[Verse 2]
I'm hearing voices up inside my head
(Oh, what you thinkin'?)
I need a sugar fix, it's making me sick
(Oh, what you drinkin'?)
I wanna drink all the poison in the water
I wanna choke like a dog that's on a collar
I am the child of coyote and bandito
I'm drinking whiskey by the river doing yayo
[Chorus]
I got the shakes and I'm on fire
I got a feeling and it's dangerous
Gonna dance to something wild
I got a feeling and I need a rush
All hell is breaking loose and Heaven only knows
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo
I don't wanna be a Romeo, no
