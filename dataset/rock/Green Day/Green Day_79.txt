[Verse 1]
I was a young boy that had big plans
Now I'm just another shitty old man
I don't have fun, and I hate everything
The world owes me, so fuck you
Glory days don't mean shit to me
I drank a six-pack of apathy
Life's a bitch, and so am I
The world owes me, so fuck you
[Chorus]
Wasted youth
, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
[Verse 2]
I've decomposed, yet my gut's gettin' fat
Oh my God, I'm turnin' out like my dad
I'm always rude, I've got a bad attitude
The world owes me, so fuck you
The wife's a nag, and the kid's fuckin' up
I don't have sex 'cause I can't get it up
I'm just a grouch sittin' on the couch
The world owes me, so fuck you
[Chorus]
Wasted youth, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
Wasted youth, and a fistful of ideals
I had a young and optimistic point of view
('Til I grew up)
[Interlude]
[Verse 1]
I was a young boy that had big plans
Now I'm just another shitty old man
I don't have fun, and I hate everything
The world owes me, so fuck you
Glory days don't mean shit to me
I drank a six-pack of apathy
Life's a bitch, and so am I
The world owes me, so fuck you
The world owes me, so fuck you
The world owes me, so fuck you
