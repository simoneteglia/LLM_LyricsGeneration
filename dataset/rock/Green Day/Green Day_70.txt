[Verse 1]
I've got a really bad disease
It's got me beggin' on my hands and knees
So take me to emergency
'
Cause somethin' seems to be missin'
Somebody, take the pain away
It's like an ulcer bleedin' in my brain
So send me to the pharmacy
So I can lose my memory
[Chorus]
I'm elated, medicated
Lord knows I tried to find a way
To run away
[Verse 2]
I think they found another cure
For broken hearts and feelin' insecure
You'd be surprised what I endure
What makes you feel so self-assured?
I need to find a place to hide
You never know what could be waitin' outside
The accidents that you could find
It's like some kinda suicide
[Chorus]
So what ails you is what impales you
I feel like I've been crucified
To be satisfied
[Bridge]
I'm a victim of my symptom
I am my own worst enemy
You're a victim of your symptom
You are your own worst enemy
Know your enemy
[Guitar Solo]
[Breakdown]
I'm elated, medicated
I am my own worst enemy
So what ails you is what impales you
You are your own worst enemy
You're a victim of the system
You are your own worst enemy
You're a victim of the system
You are your own worst enemy
