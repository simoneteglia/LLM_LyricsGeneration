[Verse 1]
I woke up to a bitter storm (Bitter year)
And Noah's Ark came washed up on the shore
The riot gear has lined the dawn (Bitter year)
Like dogs that shit on your neighbor's lawn
[Pre-Chorus]
Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison, and it tastes like lemonade
[Chorus]
Back in the USA
For a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home
And there's no place else to go
And I'm takin' it to the grave
Back in the
USA
[Verse 2]
The saddest story ever told (Bitter year)
Is feelin' safe in our suburban homes
The soldiers of an endless war (Bitter year)
And every church can have a liquor store
[Pre-Chorus]
Let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
Let them eat poison, and it tastes like lemonade
[Chorus]
Back in the USA
For a small town serenade
With fireworks on display
Tonight, it's a hero's welcome home
And there's no place else to go
And I'm takin' it to the grave
Back in the USA
