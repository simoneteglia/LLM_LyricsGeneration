[Verse 1]
Well, I've got some scattered pictures lyin' on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we've shared
Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
Well, all the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well
[Chorus]
Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It's all I've got, and I'm givin' it to you
[Verse 2]
Well, loose ends tied in knots leavin' a lump down in my throat
Well, gaggin' on a souvenir
Live to fill another year
We'll drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds
Well, leavin' myself open wide
Livin' out a sacrifice, well
[Chorus]
Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It's all I've got, and I'm givin' it to you
[Bridge]
If you got no one
And I got no place to go
Would it be alright?
Could it be alright?
[Verse 1]
Well, I've got some scattered pictures lyin' on my bedroom floor
Reminds me of the times we've shared
Makes me wish that you were here, 'cause
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life
Well, all the songs have been erased
Guess I've learned from my mistakes, well
[Chorus]
Open the past and present now, and we are there
Story to tell, and I am listening
Open the past and present and the future too
It's all I've got, and I'm givin' it to you
It's all I've got, and I'm givin' it to you
