[Pre-Chorus]
Another one down at the mining town (Woah-oh)
Breakin' it down for the lame wager
Callin' the shots from the capital (Woah-oh)
But all that we got was the banks of hope
[Chorus]
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
[Verse 1]
This city isn't big enough for dreamers
We were all believers
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)
[Pre-Chorus]
Another black kid was shot in town (Woah-oh)
A man with a badge and a daytime show
Darkness falls on Graffitia (Woah-oh)
Death of a town in the afterglow
[Chorus]
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
[Verse 2]
All souls go to heaven in Graffitia
Singin' Hallelujah
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)
If we're goin' down for a good time
Life during wartime
It's the perfect crime
(Only the lonely and wasted)
[Chorus]
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten?
Are we the long lost love?
Are we the last forgotten? (
Another one down at the mining town
)
Are we the long lost love? (
Breakin' it down for the lame wager
)
Are we the last forgotten? (Callin' the shots from the capital)
Are we the long lost love? (All that we got was the banks of hope)
[Outro]
Another one down at the mining town
Are we the last forgotten?
Callin' the shots from the capital
Are we the last forgotten?
Another one down at the mining town
Are we the last forgotten?
Callin' the shots from the capital
