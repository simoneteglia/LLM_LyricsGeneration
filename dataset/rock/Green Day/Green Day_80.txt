[Chorus]
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
[Verse 1]
Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Oh Lord, have mercy on my soul
Kindred spirits sing
For the sick and suffering (The suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we roll, roll
[Chorus]
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the cops on patrol
Say hello to the ones in control
[Verse 2]
Teach your children well
From the bottom of the well
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Oh Lord, have mercy on my soul
Hear the children sing
For the sick and suffering (The suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we roll, roll, roll
[Interlude]
[Verse 1]
Violence on the rise
Like a bullet in the sky
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) Oh Lord, have mercy on my soul
Kindred spirits sing
For the sick and suffering (The suffering)
The city of damage control
This is how we...
[Chorus]
Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say a prayer for the ones we love
Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
(This is how we!)
Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say a prayer for the ones we love
Say a prayer for the ones that we love
Say goodbye to the ones that we love
(This is how we...)
