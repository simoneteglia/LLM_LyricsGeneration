[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the Earth, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missin' link on the brink of destruction
[Verse 1]
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's a symbol of resistance
And she's holdin' on my heart like a hand grenade
[Verse 2]
Is she dreamin' what I'm thinkin'?
Is she the mother of all bombs, gonna detonate?
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate, or a melody that
[Bridge]
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothin' comes to mind (Hey!)
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Well, nothin' comes to mind
[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missin' link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the Earth, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missin' link on the brink of destruction
[Outro]
She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel, and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, she's a rebel
She's a rebel, and she's dangerous
