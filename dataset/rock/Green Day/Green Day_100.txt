[Verse 1]
I got under the grip between this modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail, and it was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in ruin
, and
this bitter pill is chased in blood
There's fire in my veins, and it's pouring out like a flood
[Chorus]
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
[Verse 2]
This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catastrophic baby, baby, maybe you're the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb, I am your chosen one
Toxin your reservoir,
and then return man to ape
[Chorus]
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
[Post-Chorus]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
Woah-oh, Christian's inferno
