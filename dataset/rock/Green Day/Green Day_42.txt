[Verse 1]
Takin' all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothin' left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway
[Chorus]
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant
[Post-Chorus]
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
[Verse 2]
I'm losin' all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
A loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through
[Chorus]
Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant
[Post-Chorus]
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
[Bridge]
Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothin'?
[Outro]
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
To me, it's nothin'
