[Bass Solo]
[Verse 1]
I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy
[Chorus]
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit
[Verse 2]
Peel me off this velcro seat and get me movin'
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feelin' like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key
[Chorus]
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit
[Bridge]
I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration (Huh!)
[Verse 3]
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's callin'
Call me pathetic, call me what you will (
We will!
)
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fuckin' lonely
[Chorus]
Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored I'm goin' blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I'm slippin' away to paradise
And some say quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth
