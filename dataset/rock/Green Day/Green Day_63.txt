[Verse 1]
Don't know much about history
'Cause I never learned how to read
Dropout, I'm a knucklehead
Sick boy and I shit the bed
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm in love with a deviant
Maybe I got terminal vertigo
[Verse 2]
Slam danced on my face again
Nonsense is my heroin
Rude boy going comatose
Dropout and I'm adi√≥s
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm in love with a deviant
Maybe I got terminal vertigo (Oh)
I defy the science, I'm a missing link
Oh God, I think I'm gonna lose my skull
[Chorus]
I said, "Look ma, I ain't got no brains"
I'm a goner and I don't feel no pain
I'm with stupid and I'm all by myself
'Cause I'm special and I don't need your help
[Bridge]
Well I'm gone, gone, gone and I'm far away (Don't panic, don't panic)
Well I lost my head and I'm here to say
(Don't go, don't go)
Oh, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, I'm all grown up (Don't panic, don't panic)
Well it's too late now for my suicide
[Chorus]
I said, "Look ma, I ain't got no brains"
I'm a goner and I don't feel no pain
I'm with stupid and I'm all by myself
'Cause I'm special and I don't need your help
