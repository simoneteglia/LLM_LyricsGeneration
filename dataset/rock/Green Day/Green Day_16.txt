[Verse 1]
Dear mother, can you hear me whinin'?
It's been three whole weeks since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me tremblin'
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feelin' so alone
[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
[Verse 2]
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's now feelin' like my home
And I'm never gonna go
[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Dear mother, can you hear me laughin'?
It's been six whole months since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason, it's now feelin' like my home
And I'm never gonna go
[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums, some call it nice
I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
Oh, paradise
