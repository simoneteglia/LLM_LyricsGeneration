[Verse 1]
I don't know you, but I think I hate you
You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become my biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face
[Chorus]
Well maybe it's just jealousy mixin' up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
[Verse 2]
You're the cloud hangin' out over my head
And hail comes crashin' down, welting my face
Magic man, egocentric plastic man
Yet you still got one over on me
[Chorus]
Well maybe it's just jealousy mixin' up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
I'm a chump!
[Bass Solo]
[Instrumental Outro]
