[Verse 1]
I'm on a mission, I've made my decision
Lead a path of self-destruction
A slow progression,
killing my complexion
And it's rotting out my teeth
[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And
I'm picking scabs off my face
[Verse 2]
Every hour, my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thin, white line
[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face, say!
[Verse 3]
I'm on a mission, I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
A wish in one hand, shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first
[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well I don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face, say!
