[Verse 1]
I'm crawling on the dance floor (Dance floor)
I think I lost my phone
Feeling like a toothache (Toothache)
My face is going numb
I beg a thousand pardons
All my friends are crazy
Hanging from a window (Window)
And all you gotta do is jump
[Chorus]
Come meet me on the roof tonight, girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?
[Verse 2]
I'm hanging with the cholos (Cholo)
Cruising down the strip
Sleeping with a pillow (Don't wake me up, don't wake me up)
Waking up in spit
I'm taking
drowning lessons
Secret words and true confessionals (Confessional)
Now the worst is yet to come
[Chorus]
Come meet me on the roof tonight, girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?
[Bridge]
So meet me where the good times go
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
How high is your low?
As far as I can go
[Chorus]
Come meet me on the roof tonight, girl
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
Come meet me on the roof tonight
Oh-ooh-oh-oh
How high is your low gonna go, girl?
