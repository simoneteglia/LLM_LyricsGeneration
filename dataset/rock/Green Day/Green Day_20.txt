[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Starry nights, city lights comin' down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin' unknown
This dirty town was burnin' down in my dreams
Lost and found, city-bound in my dreams
[Chorus]
And screamin'
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin'
And screamin'
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin'
[Verse 2]
Forget me nots, second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails, fairytales in my mind
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin' unknown
The rage and love, the story of my life
The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie
[Chorus]
And screamin'
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin'
And screamin'
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin' unknown
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin'
And screamin'
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin' unknown
Are we we are, are we we are the waitin' unknown
