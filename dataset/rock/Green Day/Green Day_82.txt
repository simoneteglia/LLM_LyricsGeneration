[Chorus]
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
(So long, farewell)
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
[Verse]
She's throwing punches to the beat
To the sound of cable TV
And she'll never see the world the same
She is a Cold War in my head
And I am East Berlin
On the danger side of parts unknown
[Pre-Chorus]
Coffee and cyanide for lovers in disgrace
If this is not a test, we got one foot in thе grave
[Chorus]
She's gonna bang her hеad like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
(So long, farewell)
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
[Bridge]
Crimes from another time
Champagne and party lines
God bless the end of times
Pain, commies and cocaine
Slam-dance in acid rain
We live the dream for
fifteen minutes of fame
[Chorus]
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
(So long, farewell)
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
She's gonna bang her head like 1981
(So long, farewell)
(So long, farewell)
