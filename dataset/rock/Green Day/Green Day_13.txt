[Part I: The Death of St. Jimmy]
[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
My heart is beatin' from me
I am standin' all alone
Please call me only
If you are comin' home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live
[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearin' gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
What the hell's your name? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
What's your pleasure, what is your pain? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do ya dream too much? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, "We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame"
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Jimmy died today (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
He blew his brains out into the bay (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
In the state of mind (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's my own private suicide
[Part II: East 12th St.]
[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well, nobody cares, well, nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
[Verse 3: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Jesus fillin' out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world, and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doin' somethin' else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough, and he had plenty
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here
[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ah-ah) So far away, I don't wanna stay (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me outta here right now (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) I just wanna be free, is there a possibility? (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me outta here right now
(Out, out, out, out) Right!
This life-like dream ain't for me!
[Part III:
Nobody
Likes You]
[Verse 4: Mike Dirnt]
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee, and you're still not here
Dreamin' of a song, but somethin' went wrong
And ya can't tell anyone, 'cause no one's here
[Pre-Chorus]
Left me here alone
And I shoulda stayed home
After ten cups of coffee, I'm thinkin'...
[Chorus: Mike Dirnt]
(
Where'd you go?
) Nobody likes you, everyone left you
(
Where'd you go?
) They're all out without you, havin' fun
(
Where'd you go?
) Everyone left you, nobody likes you
(
Where'd you go?
) They're all out without you, havin' fun
[Bridge: Mike Dirnt]
(
Where'd you go, go, go, go?
)
[Part IV: Rock and Roll Girlfriend]
[Intro: Tré Cool]
Jeez! *sigh*
[Verse 5: Tré Cool &
Billie Joe Armstrong
]
I got a rock and roll band, I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend, and another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house, I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums, and I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York, I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over twenty-two days, so get off my case (
Don't want to be an American idiot!
)
Off of my case
Off of my case!
[Part V: We're Coming Home Again]
[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Hey!
[Verse 6: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Here they come, marchin' down the street (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Comin' back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
Their time has come, and it's goin' nowhere (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Nobody ever said that life was fair, now (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bare
In the summer heat
[Pre-Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
The world is spinnin' 'round and 'round out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breakin' down
So send my love a letterbomb
And visit me in Hell
We're the ones goin'...
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
Home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ooh-ooh) I started fuckin' runnin' as soon as my feet touched ground
(Ooh-ooh) We're back in the barrio, and to you and me, that's Jingle Town
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt,
Tre Cool
]
That's home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
Home, we're comin' home again
(
No! Fuck you! Just go! I don't care! I don't! I don't know! I smashed my phone! Just go! I don't care! I don't! I don't know! I smashed my phone!
)
[Outro: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you havin' fun
