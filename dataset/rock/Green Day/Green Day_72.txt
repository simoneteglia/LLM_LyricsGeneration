[Verse 1]
Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love, first forgiveness
We were delinquents
Freaks of a fading memory
[Chorus]
Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever
[Verse 2]
Scars, broken hearts
Breakin' in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls, bottle rockets
All that we wanted
It's for our life beyond the stars
[Chorus]
Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
I've got no supervision
Nothin' will change my spirit's place to roam
I'll plead my innocence, I'll plead my innocence
But that's my best defense when you are young
[Chorus]
Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever
[Outro]
I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train, and you can't go back
Forever now, forever now, you'll roam
