[Instrumental Intro:
00:00-01:04]
[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's all right we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline filling in time
Provided with toys and scouting for boys
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
You didn't like school and you know you're nobody's fool
[Refrain]
So welcome to the machine
[Instrumental Break:
02:16-03:58
]
[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream?
It's all right we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star
He played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar
He loved to drive in his Jaguar
[Refrain]
So welcome to the machine
[Instrumental Outro]
[Synthesizer Solo]
