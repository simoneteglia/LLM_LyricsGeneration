[Verse 1]
Where were you—when I was burned and broken?
While the days slipped by from my window, watching
And where were you—when I was hurt and I was helpless?
‘Cause the things you say, and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else’s words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
[Verse 2]
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside, the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived for killing the past
And coming back to life
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight into the shining sun
