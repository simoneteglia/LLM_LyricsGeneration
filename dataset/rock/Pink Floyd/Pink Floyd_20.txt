[Intro]
...we came in?
[Verse: Roger Waters]
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
Tell me, is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise
[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Lights!
Roll the sound effects!
Action!
Drop it, drop it on 'em
Drop it, drop it on them!
*Airplane descending*
[Outro]
*Baby Crying*
