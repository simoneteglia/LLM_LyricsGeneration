[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Overhead, the albatross
Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
[Chorus 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance, two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?
[Chorus 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the Sun
[Instrumental ; 4:56 – 19:11]
[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Cloudless, every day you fall
Upon my waking
eyes
Inviting and inciting me
to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
[Chorus 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
Call to you across the sky
[Instrumental Outro]
