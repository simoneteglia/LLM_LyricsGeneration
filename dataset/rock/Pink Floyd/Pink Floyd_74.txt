[Verse 1: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Far, far, far, far away, way
People heard him say, say
I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day
Something will be done
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Then at last, the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall
[Verse 2: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Now, now, now
Is the time, time, time
To be, be, be aware
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Carter’s father saw him there
And knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake
[Verse 3: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Oh, my
Something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
was Lucy in the sky
[Verse 4: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Oh, oh
Did you ever
know, know
Never ever will they
I can't say
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed
[Verse 1: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Far, far, far, far away, way
People heard him say, say
I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day
Something will be done
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Then at last, the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall
[Verse 2: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Now, now, now
Is the time, time, time
To be, be, be aware
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Carter’s father saw him there
And knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake
[Verse 3: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Oh, my
Something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
was Lucy in the sky
[Verse 4: Richard Wright and Roger Waters]
Oh, oh
Did you ever
know, know
Never ever will they
I can't say
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed
