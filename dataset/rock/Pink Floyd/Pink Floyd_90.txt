[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown
[Refrain 1]
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you
[Verse 2]
Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn
[Refrain 2]
No fair, you can't hear me
But I can you
[Verse 3]
Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion
[Refrain 3]
Too much, I won't touch you
But then I might
[Verse 4]
Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone
[Refrain 4]
Hey, ho, here we go
Ever so high
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 5]
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown
[Refrain 5]
Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you
