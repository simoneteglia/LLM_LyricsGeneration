C-c-come back, I mean

C-c-come back, I mean
[In Old Scot Spoken]
Aye an a bit o' mackerel, fiddler, rack and fear
And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow
Well, I slipped me in a flop and hit down and I shied
And I cried, cried, cried
The fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise
And then cried 'Mary!' and I tucked up
Wi' a Claymore out and about
And I run down, down the mechyn sty
And beckoned the fiery whore
That was fallin' around the feet
"Never", I cried. "Never shall ye get me alive
Ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae"
Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
And I fell down before him 'round his feet
(That was pretty avant-garde, wasn't it?)
Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart
That I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah...
And the wind cried Mary
[In English Spoken]
