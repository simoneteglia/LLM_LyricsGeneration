[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone, my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?
[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit,
I
[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone
[Pre-Chorus]
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded, but determined to try
[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit,
I
[Bridge]
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My
grubby halo
, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds, I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
[Chorus]
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit,
I
[Verse 1]
