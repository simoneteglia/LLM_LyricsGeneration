[Segue: Verse 1: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more
[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon!
[Verse 3: Roger Waters &
Peter Watts
]
The lunatic is in my head (
Hahahahahahaha! Hehehehehehehe!
)
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
And there's someone in my head, but it's not me
[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
And if the cloudbursts thunder in your ear (Ooh)
You shout and no one seems to hear (Oh, whoa)
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes (Oh, hey)
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon!
(Oh, oh, oh)
[Outro: Peter Watts &
Patricia Watts
]
I can't think of anything to say except…
Hahahahahahaha! Hehehehehehehe!
I think it's marvellous!
Hahaha…
