[Verse 1]
You say the hill’s too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you’d like to see me try
Climbing
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You pick the place and I’ll choose the time
[Chorus 1]
And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down,
hearing the sound of the things you’ve said today
[Verse 2]
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns ’round
Frowning
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And who’s the fool who wears the crown?
[Chorus 2]
And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd
[Outro]
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Liverpool! Liverpool!
[Verse 1]
You say the hill’s too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you’d like to see me try
Climbing
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You pick the place and I’ll choose the time
[Chorus 1]
And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down,
hearing the sound of the things you’ve said today
[Verse 2]
Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns ’round
Frowning
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And who’s the fool who wears the crown?
[Chorus 2]
And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd
[Outro]
Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Liverpool! Liverpool!
