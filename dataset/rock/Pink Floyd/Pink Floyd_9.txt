[Segue: Saxophone Solo]
[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Us, and them
And after all, we're only ordinary men
[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Me, and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
“Forward!” he cried from the rear, and the front rank died
And the general sat, and the lines on the map, moved from side to side
[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Black and blue
And who knows which is which, and who is who?
[Verse 4: David Gilmour]
Up and down
And in the end, it's only round and round, and round
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
“Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?”, the poster bearer cried
“Listen, son,” said the man with the gun
“There's room for you inside”
[Interlude]
I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean, he got off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of right and wrong, innit?
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they, eh?
[Saxophone Solo]
[Verse 5: David Gilmour]
Down and out
It can't be helped, but there's a lot of it about
[Verse 6: David Gilmour]
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Out of the way, It's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died
