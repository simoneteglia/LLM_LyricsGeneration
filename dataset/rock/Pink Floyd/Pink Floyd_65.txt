[Verse 1: David Gilmour &
Choir
]
Fuck all that, we've got to get on with these
Fuck all that, fuck all that
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
There’s too many home fires burning and not enough trees
Fuck all that
So fuck all that, we've gotta get on with these
Gotta get on with these
[Verse 2: Roger Waters &
Choir
]
Can’t stop, lose job
Mind gone, silicon
Stroll on, what bomb?
Get away, pay day
Make hay, break down
Need fix, big six
Click, click
Hold on, oh no
Bingo!
Bingo!
[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em cry
Make 'em dance in the aisles
Make 'em pay
Make 'em stay
Make 'em feel okay
[Verse 3: David Gilmour &
Choir
]
Not now John, we've got to get on with the film show
Gotta get on, gotta get on
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
End of the rainbow
Who cares what it’s about as long as the kids go
As long as the kids go
So, not now John, we've gotta get on with the show
(
Gotta get on with the show
)
Gotta get on, gotta get on
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4: David Gilmour &
Choir
]
Gotta get on, gotta get on, gotta get on
Hang on John I've got to get on with this
Gotta get on, gotta get on
I don’t know what it is, but it fits on here like-- tsss
Come at the end of the shift, we’ll go and get pissed
But not now John, I've gotta get on with this
Gotta get on with this, gotta get on
[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Hold on John, I think there’s something good on
I used to read books but...*unintelligible gurgling and hissing*
It could be the news or some other abuse
Could be reusable shows
[Verse 5: Roger Waters &
Choir
]
Fuck all that, we've gotta get on with these
(
Doo, doo, wah
)
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
(
Gotta get on, gotta get on
)
No need to worry about the Vietnapeace
(
Doo, doo, wah
)
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees
(
Gotta get on
)
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear, maybe the Swedes
(
Doo, doo, wah
)
We showed Argentina, now let’s go and show these
(
Gotta get on, gotta get on
)
Make us feel tough and wouldn't Maggie be pleased?
(
Doo, doo, wah
)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na!)
One, two, Free Four!
(One, two, Free Four!)
Not now John, we've got to get on
[Outro: Roger Waters &
Choir
]
S'cusi, dov'è il bar? (What?)
(
Gotta get on
)
Se parakalo, pou einai to bar?
(
Not now John, we've got to get on
)
S’il vous plaît, où est le bar? (Say it in English, fairy!)
(
Gotta get on, gotta get on
)
Oi, where’s the fucking bar John? (Oh, now you’re talking!)
(Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day)
Down! Go, Maggie!
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now!
