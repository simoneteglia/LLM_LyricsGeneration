[Verse 1]
Emily tries, but misunderstands (Ah-ooh)
She's often inclined to borrow
Somebody’s dreams till tomorrow
[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let’s try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
[Verse 2]
Soon after dark, Emily cries (Ah-ooh)
Gazing through trees in sorrow
Hardly a sound till tomorrow
[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Put on a gown
That touches the ground (Ah-ooh)
Float on a river
Forever and ever, Emily (Emily)
[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
[Verse 1]
