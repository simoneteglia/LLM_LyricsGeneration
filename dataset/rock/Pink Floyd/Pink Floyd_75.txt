[Verse 1]
On the day the Wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high, we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
And on the day the Wall came down
The ship of fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight
[Chorus]
I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you
[Verse 2]
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there’s a change that even with regret cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history in shades of grey
[Chorus]
I woke to the sound of drums
The music played, the morning sun streamed in
I turned and I looked at you
And all but the bitter residues slipped away, slipped away
[Guitar Solo]
