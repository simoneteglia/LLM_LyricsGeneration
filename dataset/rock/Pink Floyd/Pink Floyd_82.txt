[Verse 1]
Arnold Layne
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine
[Verse 2]
On the wall
Hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He done it
[Chorus]
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
[Organ Solo]
[Verse 3]
Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang
He hates it
[Chorus]
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne, don't do it again
[Verse 1]
Arnold Layne

Oh, Arnold Layne

Why can't you see?

Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne, don't do it again
