[Verse 1]
In my rearview mirror, the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions, confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come
[Verse 2]
The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in
Gives way and suddenly it's day again
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset, hmph
Could be the human race is run
[Verse 3]
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck ("Oh no!")
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear (*scream*)
And you'll never hear their voices ("Daddy, Daddy!")
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore
[Verse 4]
And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally, I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds,
foe and friend
We were all equal in the end
[Saxophone Solo]
"…and now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east…
With an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius"
