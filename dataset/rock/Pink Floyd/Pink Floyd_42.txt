[Verse 1: Roger Waters,
with Richard Wright
]
Nobody knows where you are
How near or how far
[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond
[Verse 2: Roger Waters,
with Richard Wright
]
Pile on many more layers
And I'll be joining you there
[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond
[Chorus: Roger Waters]
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph
And sail on the steel breeze
Come on, you boy child,
you winner and loser
Come on, you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!
