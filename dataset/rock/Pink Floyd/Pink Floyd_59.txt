[Verse: Roger Waters]
You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing
[Verse: Roger Waters]
You know that I care what happens to you
And I know that you care for me too
So I don't feel alone or the weight of the stone
Now that I've found somewhere safe to bury my bone
And any fool knows a dog needs a home
A shelter from pigs on the wing
