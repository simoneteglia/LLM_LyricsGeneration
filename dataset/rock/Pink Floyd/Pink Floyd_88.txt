[Verse 1]
Her love rains down on me
It's easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing
It sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinkin' all about her burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness
And the earth was on fire
[Chorus]
She could take it back
She might take it back someday
[Verse 2]
So I spy on her, I lie to her
I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising
Rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me
I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break
[Chorus]
She might take it back
She could take it back someday
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Bridge]
Ring-a-ring o’ roses
A pocket full of posies
A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
We all fall down
[Verse 3]
Now I have seen the warnings
Screaming from all sides
It’s easy to ignore them
God knows I’ve tried
All of this temptation
You know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn’t see the danger or hear the risin' tide
[Chorus]
She can take it back
She will take it back someday
She can take it back
She will take it back someday
[Outro]
She will take it back
She will take it back someday
[Verse 1]
Her love rains down on me
It's easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing
It sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinkin' all about her burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness
And the earth was on fire
[Chorus]
She could take it back
She might take it back someday
[Verse 2]
So I spy on her, I lie to her
I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising
Rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me
I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break
[Chorus]
She might take it back
She could take it back someday
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Bridge]
Ring-a-ring o’ roses
A pocket full of posies
A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
We all fall down
[Verse 3]
Now I have seen the warnings
Screaming from all sides

God knows I’ve tried
All of this temptation
You know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn’t see the danger or hear the risin' tide
[Chorus]
She can take it back
She will take it back someday
She can take it back
She will take it back someday
[Outro]
She will take it back
She will take it back someday
