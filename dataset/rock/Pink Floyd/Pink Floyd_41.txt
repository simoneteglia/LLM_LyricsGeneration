[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, don't leave me now
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder in front of my friends
[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
(Need you, need you, need you, need you, need you, need you)
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now
[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe, why are you running away?
[Outro: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
Argh!
[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, don't leave me now
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder in front of my friends
[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
(Need you, need you, need you, need you, need you, need you)
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now
[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe, why are you running away?
[Outro: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
Argh!
