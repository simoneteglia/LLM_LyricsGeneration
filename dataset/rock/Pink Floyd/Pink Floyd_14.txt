[Segue – Verse: Roger Waters]
All that you touch
All that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
All that you love
All that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
All that you give (All you give)
All that you deal
All that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal (Hey-ey)
All you create
All you destroy (Ooooh)
And all that you do
All that you say (Heeeey-yeah)
All that you eat, everyone you meet (Everyone you meet)
All that you slight, everyone you fight (Hooooo)
All that is now and all that is gone
All that's to come, and everything under the sun is in tune (Everything), but the sun is eclipsed by the moon
[Outro]
There is no dark side in the moon really
Matter of fact, it's all dark
*Heartbeat*
