[Verse 1: Rick Wright]
There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people...
[Hook]
Oh, Mother
Tell me more
[Bridge: Syd Barrett]
Why’d'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines
[Verse 2: Rick Wright]
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
[Hook]
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes, they did
[Musical interlude]
[Verse 3: Syd Barrett]
For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by
[Hook]
Oh, Mother
Tell me more
Tell me more
[Outro]
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
