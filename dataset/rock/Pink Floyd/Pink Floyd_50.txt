[Intro: David Gilmour]
(Ah-ah) Ooh, ooh-hoo, ooh, ooh
(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
(Ooh-ma, ah, ooh-pa) Must the show go on?
(Ooh-pa, take me home, take me home, take me home)
(Ooh-ma, let me go, let me go, let me go)
[Verse: David Gilmour]
There must be some mistake, I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul, am I too old, is it too late?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Where has the feeling gone?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Will I remember the song?
[Outro: David Gilmour]
(Ooh, ooh, ah) The show must go on
[Intro: David Gilmour]
(Ah-ah) Ooh, ooh-hoo, ooh, ooh
(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
(Ooh-ma, ah, ooh-pa) Must the show go on?
(Ooh-pa, take me home, take me home, take me home)
(Ooh-ma, let me go, let me go, let me go)
[Verse: David Gilmour]
There must be some mistake, I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul, am I too old, is it too late?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Where has the feeling gone?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Will I remember the song?
[Outro: David Gilmour]
(Ooh, ooh, ah) The show must go on
