[Verse 1: Richard Wright]
From morning to night, I stayed
out of sight
Didn’t recognise I’d become
—
no more than alive
I’d barely survive—in a word, overrun
[Chorus: Richard Wright,
Sam Brown
,
Durga McBroom & Carol Kenyon]
Won’t hear a sound
(He’s curled into the corner)
From my mouth
(But still the screen is flickering)
I’ve spent too long
(With an endless stream of garbage to)
On the inside out
(…curse the place)
My skin is cold
(In a sea of random images)
To the human touch
(The self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart’s
(Waiting for the waves to break)
Not beating much
[Verse 2: Richard Wright]
I murmured a vow of silence and now
I don’t even hear when I think aloud
Extinguished by light, I turn on the night
Wear its darkness with an empty smile
[Bridge: Richard Wright]
I’m creeping back to life
My nervous system all awry
I’m wearing the inside out
[Instrumental Break 3:06 - 3:39]
[Verse 3: David Gilmour, Sam Brown, Durga McBroom & Carol Kenyon]
Look at him now, he’s paler somehow
But he’s coming around
He’s starting to choke
,
it’s been so long since he spoke
Well, he can have the words right from my mouth
[Verse 4: Richard Wright]
And with these words—I can see
Clear through the clouds—that covered me
Just give it time—then speak my name
Now we can hear—ourselves again
[Chorus: Richard Wright, Sam Brown, Durga McBroom & Carol Kenyon]
I’m holding out (He’s standing on the threshold)
For the day (Caught in fiery anger)
When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he’ll)
Have blown away (…curse the place)
I’m with you now (He’s torn in all directions)
Can speak your name (And still the screen is flickering)
Now we can hear (Waiting for the flames to break)
Ourselves again
[Verse 1: Richard Wright]
