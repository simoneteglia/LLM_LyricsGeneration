[Verse 1]
I want to tell you a story
'Bout a little man, If I can
A gnome named Grimble Grumble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping
Drinking their wine
[Verse 2]
He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue-green hood, it looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining, dining
Biding his time
[Chorus]
And then one day…
Hooray!
Another way for
gnome
s to say
Ooooooh my
[Verse 3]
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn’t it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn’t it good?
Winding, finding places to go
[Chorus]
And then one day…
Hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooooooh my
Ooooooh my
