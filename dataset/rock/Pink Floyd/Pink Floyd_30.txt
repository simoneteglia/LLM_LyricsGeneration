[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
(Ah) I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock-and-roll refugee
Ooh, baby, set me free
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl
[Outro]
*Phone beeping*
“
Hello

“Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd. Will you accept the charge, it's from the United States?”
*Phone clicks*
“Oh, he hung up. That's your residence, right? Well, I wonder why he hung up. Is there supposed to be someone out there besides your wife there to answer?”
*Phone redials and beeps again*
“
Hello
?”
“This is the United States calling. Are we reaching…”
*Phone clicks*
“See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering.”
