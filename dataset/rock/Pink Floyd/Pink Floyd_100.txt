[Refrain]
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset
[Verse]
The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all
[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise
[Refrain]
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise, sunrise
Sunset, sunrise
Sunrise
[Refrain]
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset
[Verse]
The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all
[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise
[Refrain]
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
[Chorus]
Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise, sunrise
Sunset, sunrise
Sunrise
