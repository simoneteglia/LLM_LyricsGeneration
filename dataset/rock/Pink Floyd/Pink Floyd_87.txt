[Verse 1]
Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore
[Verse 2]
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind every time
[Verse 3]
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned
[Instrumental Outro]
