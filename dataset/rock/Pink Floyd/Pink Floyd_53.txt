[Verse 1]
Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting
[Refrain]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
[Verse 2]
Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness
Waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
[Refrain]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
[Bridge]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?
[Refrain]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
[Outro]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
[Verse 1]
Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting
[Refrain]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
[Verse 2]
Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness
Waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine
[Refrain]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
[Bridge]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?
[Refrain]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun
[Outro]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
