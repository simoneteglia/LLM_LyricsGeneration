[Verse 1]
Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round?
[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
[Verse 2]
Every night I turn the light out
Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I’m hiding?
[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
[Verse 3]
Will the misty master break me?
Will the key unlock my mind?
Will the following footsteps catch me?
Am I really dying?
[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
[Outro]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
[Verse 1]
Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round?
[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
[Verse 2]
Every night I turn the light out
Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I’m hiding?
[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
[Verse 3]
Will the misty master break me?
Will the key unlock my mind?
Will the following footsteps catch me?
Am I really dying?
[Chorus]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
[Outro]
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
Julia dream, dreamboat queen
Queen of all my dreams
(Please save me!)
