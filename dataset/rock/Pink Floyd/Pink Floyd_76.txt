[Verse 1]
Heaven sent the promised land
Looks alright from where I stand
'Cause I’m the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it’s time
[Chorus]
To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old
[Verse 2]
Flash the readies
Wot’s the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turnin' of the wheel
Mile after mile (Mile after mile)
Stone after stone (Stone after stone)
Turn to speak but you’re alone
Million miles from home, you’re on your own
[Chorus]
So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old
[Piano & Guitar Solos]
[Verse 3]
Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again
Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now, I'm the man on the inside looking out
[Outro]
Hear me shout, “Come on in!"
"What’s the news and where ya been?”
'Cause there’s no wind left in my soul
And I’ve grown old
[Verse 1]
Heaven sent the promised land
Looks alright from where I stand
'Cause I’m the man on the outside looking in
Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it’s time
[Chorus]
To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old
[Verse 2]
Flash the readies
Wot’s the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turnin' of the wheel
Mile after mile (Mile after mile)
Stone after stone (Stone after stone)
Turn to speak but you’re alone
Million miles from home, you’re on your own
[Chorus]
So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
Cause there’s a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I’m growing old
[Piano & Guitar Solos]
[Verse 3]
Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again
Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now, I'm the man on the inside looking out

Hear me shout, “Come on in!"
"What’s the news and where ya been?”
'Cause there’s no wind left in my soul
And I’ve grown old
