[Intro]
Do, do-do
Do, do-do
Do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
[Verse 1]
Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year
[Pre-Chorus]
And I would like to know
[Chorus]
How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)
How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)
[Brass Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of 95
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just you let me know
[Chorus]
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Outro]
Goodbye to you,
Charlotte Pringle's due
I've had enough for one day
[Instrumental Outro]
