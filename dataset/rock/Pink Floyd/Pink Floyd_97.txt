[Verse 1]
Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play alone with time
Evening never come
[Verse 2]
Sing a song that can’t be sung
Without the morning’s kiss
Queen – you shall be it if you wish
Look for your king
[Bridge]
Why can’t we play today?
Why can’t we stay that way?
[Musical Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Climb your favourite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother’s gun
Dream yourself away
[Outro]
Why can’t we reach the sun?
Why can’t we blow the years away?
Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember
Remember
