[Verse 1]
Lucifer Sam, Siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side
[Refrain]
That cat's something I can't explain
[Verse 2]
Jennifer Gentle, you're a witch
You're the left side, he's the right side
Oh, no!
[Refrain]
That cat's something I can't explain
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Lucifer, go to sea
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat
Somewhere, anywhere
[Refrain]
That cat's something I can't explain
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 4]
At night prowling, sifting sand
Hiding around on the ground
He'll be found when you're around
[Refrain]
That cat's something I can't explain
