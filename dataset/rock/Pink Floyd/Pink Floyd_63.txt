[Verse 1: David Gilmour,
Sam Brown
,
Claudia Fontaine
&
Durga McBroom
]
As you look around this room tonight
Settle in your seat and dim the lights
Do you want my blood? Do you want my tears?
What do you want?
(
What do you want from me?
)
Should I sing until I can’t sing anymore?
Play these strings 'til my fingers are raw?
[Chorus: David Gilmour,
Sam Brown
,
Claudia Fontaine
,
Durga McBroom &
All
]
You're so hard to please
What do you want from me?
[Verse 2: David Gilmour,
Sam Brown
,
Claudia Fontaine
&
Durga McBroom
]
Do you think that I know something you don’t know?
(
What do you want from me?
)
If I don’t promise you the answers, would you go?
(
What do you want from me?
)
Should I stand out in the rain?
Do you want me to make
a daisy chain
for you?
[Chorus: David Gilmour,
Sam Brown
,
Claudia Fontaine
,
Durga McBroom &
All
]
I’m not the one you need
What do you want from me?
[Bridge: David Gilmour]
You can have anything you want
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water
Anything you want
You can own everything you see
Sell your soul for complete control, is that really what you need?
You can lose yourself this night
See inside, there is nothing to hide
Turn and face the light
[Outro: David Gilmour]
What do you want from me?
