[Verse 1]
A cloud of eiderdown
draws around me
Softening the sound
[Refrain]
Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low
[Bridge]
And the candle dies
[Verse 2]
When night comes down, you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change, the wind is warm
[Verse 3]
Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream,
the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 4]
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down
[Refrain]
Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low
[Outro]
And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky
And the night winds die
[Verse 1]
A cloud of eiderdown
draws around me
Softening the sound
[Refrain]
Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low
[Bridge]
And the candle dies
[Verse 2]
When night comes down, you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change, the wind is warm
[Verse 3]
Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream,
the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 4]
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down
[Refrain]
Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low
[Outro]
And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky
And the night winds die
