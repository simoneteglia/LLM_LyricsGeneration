[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun
[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond
[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine
[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon
[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond
[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
[Refrain: Roger Waters &
David Gilmour
]
Shine on (
Shine on
), you crazy diamond (
You crazy diamond
)
[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine
