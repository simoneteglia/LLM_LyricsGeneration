[Intro]
Here we go
[Horn honks]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' in a bar, tippin' a jar in Jackson
And on the street, the summer sun it shines
There's many a barroom queen
I've had in Jackson
But I just can't seem to drink you off my mind
[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
[Verse 2]
I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
Woo! The lady she all dressed me up in roses
She blew my nose, and then she blew my mind
[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
Ah yes
Woo! All right
[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women, yeah yeah
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
All over
[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
Yeah
