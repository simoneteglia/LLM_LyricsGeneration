[Verse 1]
Do we have something or nothing at all?
Just tell me straight
You got me high and it's quite a long fall
Tell me straight, yeah, tell me straight
How do we finish? How do we start?
Tell me straight
How do we meet? How do we part?
Just tell me straight, just tell me straight
[Chorus]
Everyone is asking questions
Answers just won't do, yeah
I need a little time just to clear my mind
Find out if it's true
[Verse 2]
Ooh, you're runnin' too fast
Tell me straight
I need an answer, how long can this last?
Just tell me straight, don't make me wait
Is my future all in the past? Yeah
Tell me straight, tell me straight
[Chorus]
Everyone is asking questions, yeah
I got one or two
Just need a little time just to clear the mind
And find out if it's true
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Is the future all in the past?
Just tell me straight
Play me a song, life's moving too fast
Just tell me straight, tell me straight
[Verse 1]
Do we have something or nothing at all?
Just tell me straight
You got me high and it's quite a long fall
Tell me straight, yeah, tell me straight
How do we finish? How do we start?
Tell me straight
How do we meet? How do we part?
Just tell me straight, just tell me straight
[Chorus]
Everyone is asking questions
Answers just won't do, yeah
I need a little time just to clear my mind
Find out if it's true
[Verse 2]
Ooh, you're runnin' too fast
Tell me straight
I need an answer, how long can this last?
Just tell me straight, don't make me wait
Is my future all in the past? Yeah
Tell me straight, tell me straight
[Chorus]
Everyone is asking questions, yeah
I got one or two
Just need a little time just to clear the mind
And find out if it's true
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Is the future all in the past?
Just tell me straight
Play me a song, life's moving too fast
Just tell me straight, tell me straight
