[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top
[Pre-Chorus]
What's it all about?
Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt
[Chorus]
When all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that light, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
[Verse 2]
We lost all that treasure in an overseas war
Just goes to show you don't get what you paid for
Bowing to the rich and you worry 'bout the poor
Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors
[Pre-Chorus]
What's that funky noise?
It's the tightening of their screws
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt
[Chorus]
All I hear is doom and gloom
But when those drums go
Boom, boom, boom
Through that night, your face, I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Yeah, baby, won't you dance with me?
Ah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Fracking deep for oil
But there's nothing in the sump
There's kids all picking at the garbage dump
I'm running out of water, so I better prime the pump
I'm trying to stay sober, but I end up drunk
[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be eating dirt
Living on the side of the road
There's some food for thought
Gonna make your head explode
Feeling kind of hurt, yeah
[Chorus]
But all I hear is doom and gloom
With all this darkness in my room
Through that night, your face I see
Baby, take a chance
Baby, won't you dance with me?
[Outro]
Yeah, come on
Baby won't you dance with me?
I'm feeling kind of hurt
Baby, won't you dance with me?
Oh yeah, sitting in the dirt
Baby, won't you dance with me?
[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night I was piloting a plane
And all the passengers were drunk and insane
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp
Shot up a horde of zombies, but I come out on top

Guess it just reflects my mood
Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt
