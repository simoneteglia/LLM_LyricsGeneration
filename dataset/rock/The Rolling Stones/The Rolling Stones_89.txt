[Verse 1]
Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
[Verse 2]
Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
[Verse 3]
Bell flight fourteen you now can land
See you on Aldebaran
Safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
[Verse 1]
Sun turnin' 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans
It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home
[Verse 2]
Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part
It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
[Verse 3]
Bell flight fourteen you now can land
See you on Aldebaran
Safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
