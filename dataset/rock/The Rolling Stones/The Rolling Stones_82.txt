[Verse 1]
I'm not talking about the kind of clothes she wears
Look at that stupid girl
I'm not talking about the way she combs her hair
Look at that stupid girl
The way she powders her nose
Her vanity shows and it shows
She's the worst thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl
[Verse 2]
I'm not talking about the way she digs for gold
Look at that stupid girl
Well, I'm talking about the way she grabs and holds
Look at that stupid girl
The way she talks about someone else
That she don't even know herself
She's the sickest thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl
[Bridge]
Well, I'm sick and tired and I really have my doubts
I've tried and tried, but it never really works out
[Verse 3]
Like a lady-in-waiting to a virgin queen
Look at that stupid girl
She bitches about things that she's never seen
Look at that stupid girl
It doesn't matter if she dyes her hair
Or the color of the shoes she wears
She's the worst thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl
[Guitar Break]
[Verse 4]
Like a lady-in-waiting to a virgin queen
Look at that stupid girl
She bitches about things that she's never seen
Look at that stupid girl
And she purrs like a pussycat
Then she turns around and hisses back
She's the sickest thing in this world
Look at that stupid girl
[Verse 1]
I'm not talking about the kind of clothes she wears
Look at that stupid girl
I'm not talking about the way she combs her hair
Look at that stupid girl
The way she powders her nose

She's the worst thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl
[Verse 2]
I'm not talking about the way she digs for gold

Well, I'm talking about the way she grabs and holds
Look at that stupid girl
The way she talks about someone else

She's the sickest thing in this world
Well, look at that stupid girl
