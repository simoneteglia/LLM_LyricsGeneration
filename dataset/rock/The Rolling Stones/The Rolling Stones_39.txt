[Verse 1]
Take me to the station
And put me on a train
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again
[Verse 2]
Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before
[Verse 3]
Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
It's here, and then it's gone
[Verse 5]
So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I’ve got no expectations
To pass through here again
[Verse 1]
Take me to the station
And put me on a train
I've got no expectations
To pass through here again
[Verse 2]
Once I was a rich man
Now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before
[Verse 3]
Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love is like our music
It's here, and then it's gone
[Verse 5]
So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I’ve got no expectations
To pass through here again
