[Part I]
[Verse 1]
Went out walking through the wood the other day
And the world was a carpet laid before me
The buds were bursting and the air smelled sweet and strange
Seemed about a hundred years ago
[Verse 2]
Mary and I, we would sit upon a gate
Just gazing at some dragon in the sky
What tender days,
we had no secrets hid away
Well, it seemed about a hundred years ago
[Bridge]
Now all my friends is wearing worried smiles
Living out a dream of what day it was
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?
[Verse 3]
Went out walking through the wood the other day
Can't you see the furrows in my forehead?
What tender days, we had no secrets hid away
Now it seemed about a hundred years ago
[Bridge]
Now if you see me drinking bad red wine
Don't worry 'bout this man that you love
Don't you think it's sometimes wise not to grow up?
[Part II]
[Verse 4]
You're gonna kiss and say goodbye
Yeah, I warn you
Yes, you're gonna kiss and say goodbye
Yeah, I warn you
Yeah, you're gonna kiss and say goodbye
Oh Lord, I warn you
And please excuse me while I hide away
[Bridge 2]
Call me lazy bones
I ain't got no time to waste away
Lazy bones
Ain't got no time to waste away
Don't you think, don't you think
It's just about time to hide away?
Yeah, yeah
