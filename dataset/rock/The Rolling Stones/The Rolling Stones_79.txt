[Verse 1]
Hey, let him follow you down
Way underground wind and he's bound
Bound to follow you down
Just a dead beat right off the street
Bound to follow you down
[Chorus 1]
Well the ballrooms and smelly bordellos
And dressing rooms filled with parasites
On stage the band has got problems
They're a bag of nerves on first nights
[Verse 2]
He ain't tied down to no home town
Yeah, and he thought he was reckless
You think he's bad, he thinks you're mad
Yeah, and the guitar player gets restless
[Chorus 2]
But his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away
[Pedal Steel Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
But his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away
[Verse 3]
Joe's got a cough, sounds kind of rough
Yeah, and the codeine to fix it
Doctor prescribes drug store supplies
Who's gonna help him to kick it?
[Chorus 2]
And his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away
[Outro]
Well his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Just as long as the guitar plays
Just as long as the guitar plays
Just as long as the guitar plays
[Verse 1]
Hey, let him follow you down
Way underground wind and he's bound
Bound to follow you down
Just a dead beat right off the street
Bound to follow you down
[Chorus 1]
Well the ballrooms and smelly bordellos
And dressing rooms filled with parasites
On stage the band has got problems
They're a bag of nerves on first nights
[Verse 2]
He ain't tied down to no home town
Yeah, and he thought he was reckless
You think he's bad, he thinks you're mad
Yeah, and the guitar player gets restless
[Chorus 2]
But his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away
[Pedal Steel Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
But his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away
[Verse 3]
Joe's got a cough, sounds kind of rough
Yeah, and the codeine to fix it
Doctor prescribes drug store supplies
Who's gonna help him to kick it?
[Chorus 2]
And his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Let it steal your heart away
Steal your heart away
[Outro]
Well his coat is torn and frayed
It's seen much better days
Just as long as the guitar plays
Just as long as the guitar plays
Just as long as the guitar plays
Just as long as the guitar plays
