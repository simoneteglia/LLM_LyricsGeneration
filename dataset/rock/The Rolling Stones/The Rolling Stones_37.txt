[Intro]
Ah... hey
Yeah, got some tail
[Verse 1]
I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scare-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs, but
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime
[Verse 2]
I can see that you're fifteen years old
No, I don't want your I.D
And I can see that you're so far from home but
That's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime
[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet, bet your mama don't know you scream like that
I bet your mother don't know you do spit like that
[Verse 3]
You look so weird, and you're so far from home
But you don't really miss your mother
You look so scared, I'm not no mad-brained bear
But, but it's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime
[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Woo!
I bet your mama don't know that you scratch like that
I bet she don't know you can bite like that
[Verse 4]
You say you got a friend, and she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild, then she can join in too
It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime
[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Oh yeah, don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet your mama don't know you can bite like that
I'll bet she never saw you scratch my back
