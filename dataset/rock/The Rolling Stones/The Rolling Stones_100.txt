[Verse 1]
Men at arms shout who goes there
We have journeyed far from here
Armed with Bibles, make us swear
[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel
[Verse 2]
Flags are flying, dollar bills
Round the heights of concrete hills
You can see the pinnacles
[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel
[Verse 3]
In the streets are many walls
Hear the peasants come and crawl
You can hear their numbers called
[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel
[Verse 4]
Screaming people fly so fast
In their shiny metal cars
Through the woods of steel and glass
[Chorus]
Candy and Taffy, hope you both are well
Please come see me in the citadel
Oh well!
[Verse 1]
Men at arms shout who goes there

Flags are flying, dollar bills
Round the heights of concrete hills
You can see the pinnacles
