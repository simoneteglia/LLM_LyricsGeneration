[Intro]
My-My-My-My
[Verse 1]
Don't you worry about what's on your mind, oh my
I'm in no hurry, I can take my time, oh my
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied
(Tongue's getting tied)
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm high, but I try, try, try, oh my
[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
My-my-my-my, oh my
[Verse 2]
I feel so strong that I can't disguise, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
But I just can't apologize, oh no
(Let's spend the night together)
Don't hang me up and don't let me down (Don't let me down)
We could have fun just groovin' around, 'round and 'round
And oh my, my
[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
[Interlude]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
[Bridge]
You know I'm smiling, baby
You need some guiding, baby
I'm just deciding, baby, now
I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together
Let's spend the night together now
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my-my
[Verse 3]
This doesn't happen to me every day, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
No excuses offered anyway, oh my
(Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need (Your every need)
And now I know you will satisfy me
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my
[Chorus]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now
[Outro]
Oh m-my-my-my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I need you, need you more than ever, woman
(Let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need, woman
(Let's spend the night together)
Now I know, I know you'll satisfy me, whoa, my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
I beg you, baby, oh my-my-my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
A-come on, now, oh baby, my-my-my-my
(Let's spend the night together)
