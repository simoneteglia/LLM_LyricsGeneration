[Verse 1]
There've been so many girls that I've known
I've made so many cry and still I wonder why
Here comes the little girl, I see her walking down the street
She is all by herself, I try and knock her off her feet
'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone
[Verse 2]
What's different about her? I don't really know
No matter how I try, I just can't make her cry
'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone
[Verse 3]
Don't keep on looking that same old way
If you try acting sad, you will only make me glad
Better listen little girl, you go on walking down the street
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet
'Cause she'll never break, never break, never break, never break
This heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no, this heart of stone
[Outro]
Oh, no, no, no
You'll never break this heart of stone, darling
No, no, this heart of stone
You'll never break it, darling
You won't break this heart of stone
Oh, no, no, no
You better go, you better go home
'Cause you'll, you'll never break this heart of stone
You better, you better drive on home
