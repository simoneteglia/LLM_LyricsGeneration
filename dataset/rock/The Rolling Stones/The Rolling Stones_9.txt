[​Instrumental Intro]
[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
[​Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
[Instrumental Break​]
[Verse 1]
Have you seen her dressed in blue?
See the sky in front of you
And her face is like a sail
Speck of white, so fair and pale
Have you seen a lady fairer?
[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
[Verse 2]
Have you seen her all in gold?
Like a queen in days of old
She shoots colours all around
Like a sunset going down
Have you seen a lady fairer?
[Chorus]
She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours

She comes in colours everywhere
She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow
Coming colours in the air
Oh, everywhere
She comes in colours
