She said, "My breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy"

And if you want it, baby, well, you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
Yeah, and if you want to, well, you can cream on me

When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty, filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse
Oh, what pleasant company,
ha
[Verse 3]
We all need someone we can feed on
Yeah, and if you want it, well, you can feed on me, hey
Take my arm, take my leg
Oh baby, don't you take my head
[Verse 4]
Woo
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well, you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, yeah, and if you want it, baby
Why don't you bleed on me? (All over, woo!)
