[Verse 1]
If you live by the sword, gonna die by the sword
If you live by the gun, you gonna die by the gun
If you live for the knife, well, you’re gonna get stabbed
Run into the law, well, you’re gonna get nabbed
If you live for revenge, gonna feel the backlash
If you live to be cruel, gonna bite you in the ass
[Chorus]
I’m gonna treat you right
I’m gonna treat you good
[Verse 2]
If you wanna get rich, better sit on the board
If you wanna be poor, better pay the landlord
If you’re deep in the crime, well, you’re deep in the slime
If you’re living a lie, look me straight in the eye
If you’re locked in the jail, well, you better get free
If you’re looking for love, don’t go running to me
[Chorus]
I’m gonna treat you right
I’m gonna treat you good
[Bridge]
It’s too late to say you’re sorry, sorry, sorry
And soon it will be gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
If you live like a whore, better be hardcore
If you live by the clock, well, you’re in for a shock
If you’re living for food, better lick up your plate
If you wanna be in fashion, well, you’ll be out of date
[Chorus]
I’m gonna treat you right
I’m gonna treat you good
I’m gonna treat you right
I’m gonna treat you good
[Outro]
Oh, if you live by the sword, oh yeah
Get shot up, you better call 911
And then you better hang out until the ambulance comes
If you live by the sword
Gonna die by the sword, oh yeah
If you die by the sword
If you live by the gun
If you live by the gun
If you live by the gun, gonna die by the gun
Oh yeah
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
[Verse 1]
If you live by the sword, gonna die by the sword
If you live by the gun, you gonna die by the gun
If you live for the knife, well, you’re gonna get stabbed
Run into the law, well, you’re gonna get nabbed
If you live for revenge, gonna feel the backlash
If you live to be cruel, gonna bite you in the ass
[Chorus]
I’m gonna treat you right
I’m gonna treat you good
[Verse 2]
If you wanna get rich, better sit on the board
If you wanna be poor, better pay the landlord
If you’re deep in the crime, well, you’re deep in the slime
If you’re living a lie, look me straight in the eye
If you’re locked in the jail, well, you better get free
If you’re looking for love, don’t go running to me
[Chorus]
I’m gonna treat you right
I’m gonna treat you good
