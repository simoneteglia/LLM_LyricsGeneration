[Verse 1]
When your spine is cracking and your hands, they shake
Heart is bursting and your butt's going to break
Your woman's cussing, you can hear her scream
Feel like murder in the first degree
Ain't nobody slowing down no way
Everybody’s stepping on their accelerator
Don't matter where you are
Everybody’s going to need a ventilator
[Verse 2]
When you're trapped and circled with no second chances
Your code of living is your gun in hand
We can't be browed by beating, we can't be cowed by words
Messed by cheating, ain't gonna ever learn
Everybody walking around
Everybody trying to step on their Creator
Don't matter where you are
Everybody, everybody going to need some kind of ventilator
Some kind of ventilator
Come down and get it
[Outro]
What you going to do about it?
What you going to do?
What you going to do about it?
What you going to do?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
Gonna fight it? Gonna fight it?
