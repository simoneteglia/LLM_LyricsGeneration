Verse 1

I'm going to tell you how it's going to be
You're gonna give your love to me
I'm gonna love you night and day
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away

My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show it and you're driving me back
Your love for me has got to be real
For you to know just how I feel
Love is real and not fade away
Well love is real and not fade away

A love that lasts more than one day
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
Well love is love and not fade away
