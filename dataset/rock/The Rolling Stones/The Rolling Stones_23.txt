[Part I]
[Verse 1: Mick Jagger]
I hear the sweet, sweet sounds of Heaven
Fallin' down, fallin' down to this earth
I hear the sweet, sweetest sounds of Heaven
Driftin' down, driftin' down to this earth
[Chorus: Mick Jagger]
Bless the Father, bless the Son
Hear the sound of the drums
As it echoes through the valley
And it bursts, yeah
Let no woman or child
Go hungry tonight
Please protect us from the pain
And the hurt, yeah
