[Verse 1]
Hey babe, what's in your eyes?
I saw them flashing like airplane lights
You fill my cup, babe, that's for sure
I must come back for a little more
[Verse 2]
You got my heart, you got my soul
You got the silver, you got the gold
You got the diamonds from the mine
Well, that's all right, it'll buy some time
[Verse 3]
Tell me, honey, what will I do
When I'm hungry and thirsty too?
I'm feeling foolish, and that's for sure
Just waiting here at your kitchen door
[Verse 4]
Hey baby, what's in your eyes?
Is that the diamonds from the mine?
What's that laughing in your smile?
I don't care, no, I don't care
[Verse 5]
Oh babe, you got my soul
You got the silver, you got the gold
You got your love, just leave me blind
I don't care, no, that's no big surprise
[Verse 1]
