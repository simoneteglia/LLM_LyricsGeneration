[Verse 1]
Your fingerprints in the dark
Your past and present tangle up in my arms
Our secrets sealed in our scars
Sharing a smoke on the steps of a bar
I was convinced I had your heart in my hands
I was making love into our different plans
[Chorus]
Now she's giving my loving to somebody new
I invented the game but I lost like a fool
Now I’m too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you, yeah
'Cause I was depending on you
[Verse 2]
It’s time to harden my shell
The toughest part is I know you too well
Now I'm just a story you tell
Embroidering the truth with things you nеver felt
You steal thе spirit right out of a man
Now you're working on him and you don't give a damn
[Chorus]
Now she's giving my loving to somebody new
I invented the game but I lost like a fool
Now I'm too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you, yeah
'Cause I was depending on you
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Now she’s giving my loving to somebody else
She threw me down like a book off the shelf
Now I’m too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you
’Cause I was depending on you
[Outro]
Depending on you
Yeah, depending on you
Ayy, I was depending, relying on you
I was depending, depending on you
I was depending on you
[Verse 1]
Your fingerprints in the dark
Your past and present tangle up in my arms
Our secrets sealed in our scars
Sharing a smoke on the steps of a bar
I was convinced I had your heart in my hands
I was making love into our different plans
[Chorus]
Now she's giving my loving to somebody new
I invented the game but I lost like a fool
Now I’m too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you, yeah
'Cause I was depending on you
[Verse 2]
It’s time to harden my shell
The toughest part is I know you too well
Now I'm just a story you tell
Embroidering the truth with things you nеver felt
You steal thе spirit right out of a man
Now you're working on him and you don't give a damn
[Chorus]
Now she's giving my loving to somebody new
I invented the game but I lost like a fool
Now I'm too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you, yeah
'Cause I was depending on you
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Now she’s giving my loving to somebody else
She threw me down like a book off the shelf
Now I’m too young for dying and too old to lose
'Cause I was depending on you
’Cause I was depending on you
[Outro]
Depending on you
Yeah, depending on you
Ayy, I was depending, relying on you
I was depending, depending on you
I was depending on you
