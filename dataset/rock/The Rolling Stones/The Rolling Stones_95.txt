[Verse 1]
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Carolina
[Verse 2]
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
I'll make my play in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time
Baby
[Verse 3]
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Well, my heavy throbber's itching
Just to lay a solid rhythm down
Here
[Verse 1]
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Carolina
[Verse 2]
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
I'll make my play in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time
Baby
[Verse 3]
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Well, my heavy throbber's itching
Just to lay a solid rhythm down
Here
