[Verse 1]
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright, or in the darkest night
No one knows, she comes and goes
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you
[Verse 2]
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained to a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost, at such a cost
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you
[Verse 3]
"There's no time to lose," I heard her say
"Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
, lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind, ain't life unkind?"
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you
[Chorus]
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you
[Instrumental Outro]
