[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you 'bout a dance
That's going around
Everybody's doing it
From the grownups down
[Chorus]
Don't move your head
Don't move your hands
Don't move your lips
Just shake your hips
Do the hip shake, babe
Do the hip shake, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Shake your hip, babe
[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know
Don't be afraid
Just listen to me
And do what I say
[Chorus]
Don't move your head
Don't move your hands
Don't move your lips
Just shake your hips
Do the hip shake, babe
Do the hip shake, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Now ain't that easy?
[Verse 3]
Well, I met a little girl
In a country town
She said, What do you know
There's Slim Harpo!
[Chorus]
Didn't move her head
Didn't move her hands
Didn't move her lips
Just shake your hips
Do the hip shake, babe
Do the hip shake, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Well ain't that easy?
[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you 'bout a dance
That's going around
Everybody's doing it
From the grownups down
[Chorus]
Don't move your head
Don't move your hands
Don't move your lips
Just shake your hips
Do the hip shake, babe
Do the hip shake, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Shake your hip, babe
[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know
Don't be afraid
Just listen to me
And do what I say
[Chorus]
Don't move your head
Don't move your hands
Don't move your lips
Just shake your hips
Do the hip shake, babe
Do the hip shake, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Now ain't that easy?
[Verse 3]
Well, I met a little girl
In a country town
She said, What do you know

[Chorus]
Didn't move her head
Didn't move her hands
Didn't move her lips
Just shake your hips
Do the hip shake, babe
Do the hip shake, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Shake your hip, babe
Well ain't that easy?
