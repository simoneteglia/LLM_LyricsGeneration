[Intro]
Yeow
Yeow
Yeow
[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game
[Verse 2]
Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game, ah yeah
[Verse 3]
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made
I shouted out
"Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game, ah yeah
(Ah, get down heavy!)
[Instrumental Break 02:48-03:24]
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you
Is just the nature of my game, mm yeah
[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game, mmm mean it
[Outro w/Guitar Solo]
Get down
Woo hoo!
Ah yeah, get on down
Oh yeah
Ba bum bum, ba ba bum
Ah yeah
Tell me baby, what's my name?
Tell me honey, can you guess my name?
Tell me baby, what's my name?
I'll tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo hoo, ooo hoo, oooo hoo
All right
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yes, what's my name?
Tell me, baby, ah what's my name?

Ah yeah
