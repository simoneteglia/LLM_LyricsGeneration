[Verse 1]
Hannah honey was a peachy kind of girl
Her eyes were hazel and her nose was slightly curved
We spent a lonely night at the Memory Motel
It's on the ocean, I guess you know it well
It took a starry night to steal my breath away
Down on the waterfront her hair all drenched in spray
Hannah baby was a honey of a girl
Her eyes were hazel and her teeth were slightly curved
She took my guitar and she began to play
She sang a song to me, stuck right in my brain
[Chorus]
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to be
You're just a memory
Of a love that used to mean so much to me
[Post-Chorus]
She got a mind of her own
And she use it well, yeah
Well she's one of a kind
Got a mind
She got a mind of her own, yeah
And she use it mighty fine
[Verse 2]
She drove a pick-up truck painted green and blue
The tires were wearing thin, she done a mile or two
When I asked her where she headed for
"Back up to Boston, I'm singing in a bar"
I got to fly today on down to Baton Rouge
My nerves are shot already, the road ain't all that smooth
Across in Texas is the rose of San Antone
I keep on a feeling that gnawing in my bones
[Chorus]
You're just a memory (Just a memory)
Of a love that used to mean so much to me
(Just a memory)
You're just a memory (Just a memory)
Of a love that used to mean so much to me
(You're just a memory girl)
You're just a sweet memory
And it used to mean so much to me
Sha la laa la
Sha la laa la
Sha la laa la
Sha la laa la
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me
[Post-Chorus]
She got a mind of her own and she use it well, yeah
Mighty fine, 'cause she's one of a kind
She got a mind of her own
She's one of a kind and she use it well
[Verse 3]
On the seventh day my eyes were all a-glaze
We been ten thousand miles and been in fifteen states
Every woman seemed to fade out of my mind
I hit the bottle and I hit the sack and cried
What's all this laughter on the twenty-second floor?
It's just some friends of mine and they're busting down the doors
It's been a lonely night at the Memory Motel
[Chorus]
You're just a memory girl, just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory girl, you're just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory girl, you're just a memory
And it used to mean so much to me
You're just a memory of a love that used to mean so much to me
Mean so much to me
[Outro]
She's got a mind of her own and she use it well yeah
Well she's one of a kind
