[Verse 1]
Listen, I walk the city at midnight with the past strapped to my back
Lately, I can't get no sleep, I'm a real insomniac
I was chattin' with a ghost, wants a hundred and a match
Says, "I know you got the money, where's the man behind the mask?"
[Chorus]
I wanna get close to you
I wanna get close to you
I wanna get close to you
[Verse 2]
I walk this way a million times with a blindfold on my eyes
It's a nighttime business with an angel in disguise
I bargained with the devil, I need heaven for one night
I can't stand this chaos, it's churnin' up my mind
[Chorus]
I wanna get close to you
I wanna get close to you
I wanna get lost in you
[Bridge]
Talk to me, pour your secrets out, yеah
Tell me I'm the only man you еver dream about
Talk to me, why don't you scream it out? Yeah
Tell me that you'd rather die than live without, live without me
[Saxophone Solo]
[Chorus]
I wanna get close to you
I wanna get close to you, yeah, come on
[Bridge]
Talk to me, pour your secrets out, yeah
Tell me I'm the only man you ever dream about
Talk to me, why don't you scream it out?
Tell me that you'd rather die than live without, live without me
[Chorus]
I wanna get close to you (Yeah, yes, I do)
I wanna get close to you (Oh, oh, close to you)
I wanna get high on you (Mm, high on you)
I wanna get lost in you (Oh yeah, lost, lost, lost in you)
I wanna dive into you (I, yeah)
I wanna get close to you
