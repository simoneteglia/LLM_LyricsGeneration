[Verse 1]
Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone
Only a crowd can make you feel so alone
And it really hit home
Booze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine
Well here's
another goodbye to another good friend
[Chorus]
So after all is said and done
Got to move while it's still fun
Let me walk before they make me run
After all is said and done
I got to move, it's still fun
I'm going to walk before they make me run
[Verse 2]
Watched the taillights fading
There ain't a dry eye in the house
They're laughing and singing
Started dancing and drinking as I left town
Going to find my way to heaven
Because I did my time in hell
I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well
[Chorus]
After all is said and done
I got to move, I had my fun
Let us walk before they make us run
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Well, after all is said and done
I did all right, I had my fun
I will walk before they make me
I will walk before they make me run
I will walk before they make me run
I will walk before they make me run
[Outro]
So if it's all been said and done
I've got to move, I've had my fun
Well let me walk before they make me run
Oh let me walk before they make me run
I want to walk before they make me run
Before they make me run
[Verse 1]
Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone
Only a crowd can make you feel so alone
And it really hit home
Booze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine
Well here's
another goodbye to another good friend
[Chorus]
So after all is said and done
Got to move while it's still fun
Let me walk before they make me run
After all is said and done
I got to move, it's still fun
I'm going to walk before they make me run
[Verse 2]
Watched the taillights fading
There ain't a dry eye in the house
They're laughing and singing
Started dancing and drinking as I left town
Going to find my way to heaven
Because I did my time in hell
I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well
[Chorus]
After all is said and done
I got to move, I had my fun
Let us walk before they make us run
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Well, after all is said and done
I did all right, I had my fun
I will walk before they make me
I will walk before they make me run
I will walk before they make me run
I will walk before they make me run
[Outro]
So if it's all been said and done
I've got to move, I've had my fun
Well let me walk before they make me run
Oh let me walk before they make me run
I want to walk before they make me run
Before they make me run
