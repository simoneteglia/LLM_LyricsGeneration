[Intro]
What a drag it is getting old
[Verse 1]
"Kids are different today"
I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today
To calm her down
And though she's not really ill
There's a little yellow pill
[Chorus]
She goes running for the shelter
Of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day
[Verse 2]
"Things are different today"
I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for her husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake
And she burns a frozen steak
[Chorus]
And goes running for the shelter
Of
her mother's little helper
And two help her on her way
Get her through her busy day
[Bridge]
"Doctor, please
Some more of these"
Outside the door
She took four more
What a drag it is getting old
[Verse 3]
"Men just aren't the same today"
I hear every mother say
"They just don't appreciate that you get tired"
They're so hard to satisfy
You can tranquilize your mind
[Chorus]
So go running for the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
And four help you through the night
Help to minimize your plight
[Bridge]
"Doctor, please
Some more of these"
Outside the door
She took four more
What a drag it is getting old
[Verse 4]
"Life's just much too hard today"
I hear every mother say
The pursuit of happiness
Just seems a bore
And if you take more of those
You will get an overdose
[Chorus]
No more running for the shelter
Of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way
Through your busy, dying day
[Outro]
Hey!
