[Verse 1]
If I could stick my pen in my heart
And spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy you? Would it slide on by you?
Would you think the boy is strange?
Ain't he strange?
[Verse 2]
If I could win you, if I could sing you
A love song so divine
Would it be enough for your cheatin' heart
If I broke down and cried?
If I cried
[Chorus]
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it
I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, well, I like it
Ooh, I like it
I like it
I said, can't you see that this old boy has been a-lonely?
[Verse 3]
If I could stick a knife in my heart
Suicide right on stage
Would it be enough for your teenage lust?
Would it help to ease the pain?
Ease your brain
[Verse 4]
If I could dig down deep in my heart
Feelings would flood on the page
Would it satisfy you? Would it slide on by you?
Would you think the boy's insane?
He is insane
[Chorus]
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, well, I like it
Yeah, I like it
I like it
I said, can't you see that this old boy has been a-lonely?
[Bridge]
Mm
And do you think that you're the only girl around?
I bet you think that you're the only woman in town
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it
I said, I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it (Woo)
I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it, yeah
I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do
[Outro]
Oh, well, I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it (Only rock 'n' roll, but)
I like it (Only rock 'n' roll, but)

Oh, I really like it
Ooh yeah, I like that
