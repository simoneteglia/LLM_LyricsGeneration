[Verse 1]
She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor
[Pre-Chorus]
Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I, I realize that she's really gone for good
[Chorus]
Anybody seen my baby?
Anybody seen her around?
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd
[Verse 2]
I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her
And getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?
[Pre-Chorus]
The salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared?
Has she really gone for good?
[Chorus]
Anybody seen my baby? (Anybody seen my baby?)
Anybody seen her around? (Oh, hope anybody seen her around)
If I just close my eyes (I close my eyes)
I reach out and touch the prize
Anybody seen, anybody seen her around?
(Oh yeah, that's what I'm sayin')
[Bridge]
We came to rock for Brooklyn
And Queens
And Manhattan
And the Bronx
And Staten Island
I can't forget New Jersey
And Long Island
And all over the world
We came to rock for everybody, uh, like this
[Chorus]
Anybody seen my baby? (Anybody, anybody seen my baby?)
Has anybody seen her, anybody seen her around?
If I just close my eyes
I will reach out, reach out and touch the prize
Anybody, anybody seen her around? Oh yeah
[Outro]
(Anybody seen my baby?) Anybody seen her?
(Anybody seen her around?) Lost, lost and never found
I must, I must have called her a thousand times
Oh, sometimes I think she's just in my imagination
Lost, lost in the crowd
[Verse 1]
She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor
[Pre-Chorus]
Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I, I realize that she's really gone for good
[Chorus]
Anybody seen my baby?
Anybody seen her around?
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd
[Verse 2]
