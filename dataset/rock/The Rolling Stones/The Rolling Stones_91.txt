[Verse 1]
Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
[Chorus]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
[Verse 2]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
[Chorus]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Well, I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown
[Chorus]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
[Verse 1]
Well, baby used to stay out all night long
She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
[Chorus]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
[Verse 2]
Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry
[Chorus]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Well, I used to wake in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown
[Chorus]
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
