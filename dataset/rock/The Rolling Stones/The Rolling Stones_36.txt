[Verse 1]
You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine
[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Chorus]
Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Verse 2]
The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good you're thinking that you are still mine
[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Chorus]
Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Verse 3]
You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, oh no
[Pre-Chorus]
You're obsolete my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Chorus]
Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Sing the song now...
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Verse 4]
You don't know what's going on
You've been away for much too long
But you can't come back and think you are still mine
[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Chorus]
Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes you are
I said no, out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Alright
[Outro]
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're...
[Verse 1]
You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine
[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Chorus]
Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Verse 2]
The girl who wants to run away
Discovers that she's had her day
It's no good you're thinking that you are still mine
[Pre-Chorus]
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor unfaithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Chorus]
Well baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt 'cause
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
[Verse 3]
You thought you were a clever girl

Alright
[Outro]
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're...
