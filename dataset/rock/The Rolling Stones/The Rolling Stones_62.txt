[Verse 1]
Mama says yes, Papa says no
Make up you mind 'cause I gotta go
I'm gonna raise hell at the Union Hall
Drive myself right over the wall
[Chorus]
Rip this joint, going to save your soul
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Roll this joint, going to get down low
Start my starter, going to stop the show
Yeah, oh yeah!
[Verse 2]
Mister President, Mister Immigration Man
Let me in, sweetie, to your fair land
I'm Tampa bound and Memphis too
Short Fat Fanny is on the loose
[Chorus]
Dig that sound on the radio
Then slip it right across into Buffalo
Dick and Pat in ole D.C.,
Well they're going to hold some shit for me
[Post-Chorus]
Ying yang, you're my thing
Oh, now, baby, won't you hear me sing
Flip Flop, fit to drop
Come on baby, won't you let it rock?
[Saxophone Solo]
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
[Verse 3]
From San Jose down to Santa Fe
Kiss me quick, baby, won'tcha make my day
Down to New Orleans with the Dixie Dean
Across to Dallas, Texas with the Butter Queen
[Chorus]
Rip this joint, gonna rip yours too
Some brand new steps and some weight to lose
Gonna roll this joint, gonna get down low
'Round and 'round and 'round we'll go
[Post-Chorus]
Wham, bam, Birmingham
Alabama don't give a damn
Little Rock fit to drop
Ah, let it rock
[Verse 1]
Mama says yes, Papa says no
Make up you mind 'cause I gotta go
I'm gonna raise hell at the Union Hall
Drive myself right over the wall
[Chorus]
Rip this joint, going to save your soul
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Roll this joint, going to get down low
Start my starter, going to stop the show
Yeah, oh yeah!
