[Verse 1]
Well, I got to take a break from it all
'Cause the wind and the wilderness calls
And I just need some peace from the storms
I got to take a break from it all
[Verse 2]
And I got to take a break for a while
Where there ain't another human for a hundred miles
I hate being enclosed by the walls
And I got to take a break from it all
[Verse 3]
I'll be dancing on diamonds, I'll be skating on glass
I'll be chopping up wood, I'll be splitting the halves
An old AM radio is all that I've got
It just plays Hank Williams and some bad honky-tonk
'Cause I got to take a break from it all
[Verse 4]
And I got to brеak away from it all
From the city and the suburbs and sprawl
And the small town chattеr and the know-it-alls
To a place where no one can call
[Verse 5]
And I won't hear the sirens or the maddening crowd
Just the bark of a fox and the hoot of an owl
Ain't got no connections or a satellite phone
I'm avoiding the pictures and the people back home
And I just got to break free from it all
[Bridge]
You see, they can't last forever, I'll be diving back in
It's good for my soul, yes, it's saving my skin
'Cause I love the laughter, the women, the wine
I just got to break free from it all
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 6]
But I’m way off the grid, off the trail
I ain’t gonna post and I ain’t gonna mail
I just need some peace from the storm
Well, I got to break away from it all
[Outro]
And I got to break away from it all
And I got to break away from it all
To a place where no one can call
And I got to break away from it all
[Verse 1]
Well, I got to take a break from it all
'Cause the wind and the wilderness calls
And I just need some peace from the storms
I got to take a break from it all
[Verse 2]
And I got to take a break for a while
Where there ain't another human for a hundred miles
I hate being enclosed by the walls
And I got to take a break from it all
[Verse 3]
I'll be dancing on diamonds, I'll be skating on glass
I'll be chopping up wood, I'll be splitting the halves
An old AM radio is all that I've got
It just plays Hank Williams and some bad honky-tonk
'Cause I got to take a break from it all
[Verse 4]
And I got to brеak away from it all
From the city and the suburbs and sprawl
And the small town chattеr and the know-it-alls
To a place where no one can call

And I got to break away from it all
And I got to break away from it all
To a place where no one can call
And I got to break away from it all
