[Chorus]
She's my little rock 'n' roll ah hah hah hah
Oh, she's my little rock 'n' roll, baby
[Verse 1]
The heat's raiding, the tracks is fading
Joint's rocking, could be any time at all
But the bitch keeps bitching
Snitcher keeps snitching
Dropping names and telephone numbers and all, well
[Chorus]
She's my little rock 'n' roll, ah ha haahah
Oh, she's my little rock 'n' roll, ah hah hah
[Verse 2]
The score's even
But
the dealer's squealing
The pool's in, but the patio ain't dry
Well, my sense is sensing
That the juice keeps pumping, I know why
She's my little rock 'n' roll, ah hah
My
tits and ass
with soul, baby
[Chorus]
She's my little rock 'n' roll, ah hah, oh ho
She's my little rock 'n' roll, hyah
[Verse 3]
You got to shock them, show them
She's my little rock 'n' roll, yeah
Shock, shock, shock, my, my
Well, the sense is sensing
That the juice keeps pumping, and I know why
Hey!
The bitch keeps bitching
Snitcher keeps snitching
Dropping names and telephone numbers and all
[Outro]
She's my little rock 'n' roll, ah hah
My tits and ass with soul, baby
She's my little rock 'n' roll, yeah
You got to shock them, show them
She's my little rock 'n' roll, ah ha
She's got a feeling to know, baby
She's my little rock 'n' roll, hey
Ah, the little bitch got soul
42
She's my little rock & roll
Ha, ho, shock them, show that
She's my little rock 'n' roll, yeah
Oh, she's my little rock & roll
Her tits and ass with soul, honey
She's my little rock 'n' roll, baby
Her tits and ass with soul
She's my little rock & roll, woo...
[Chorus]
She's my little rock 'n' roll ah hah hah hah
Oh, she's my little rock 'n' roll, baby
[Verse 1]
The heat's raiding, the tracks is fading
Joint's rocking, could be any time at all
But the bitch keeps bitching
Snitcher keeps snitching
Dropping names and telephone numbers and all, well
[Chorus]
She's my little rock 'n' roll, ah ha haahah
Oh, she's my little rock 'n' roll, ah hah hah
