[Verse 1]
Some girls give me money
Some girls buy me clothes
Some girls give me jewelry
That I never thought I'd own
[Verse 2]
Some girls give me diamonds
Some girls, heart attacks
Some girls I give all my bread to
I don't ever want it back
[Verse 3]
Some girls give me jewelry
Others buy me clothes
Some girls give me children
I never asked them for
[Chorus]
So give me all your money
Give me all your gold
I'll buy you a house back in Zuma beach
And give you half of what I own
[Verse 4]
Some girls take my money
Some girls take my clothes
Some girls get the shirt off my back
And leave me with a lethal dose
[Verse 5]
Yeah
French girls they want Cartier
Italian girls want cars
American girls want everything in the world
You can possibly imagine
[Verse 6]
English girls they're so prissy
I can't stand them on the telephone
Sometimes I take the receiver off the hook
I don't want them to ever call at all
[Verse 7]
White girls they're pretty funny
Sometimes they drive me mad
Black girls just wanna get fucked all night
I just don't have that much jam
[Verse 8]
Chinese girls are so gentle
They're really such a tease
You never know quite what they're cooking
Inside those silky sleeves
[Chorus]
Give me all you money
Give me all your gold
I'll buy you a house back in Zuma beach
And give you half of what I own
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, baby, why don't you please come home?
[Verse 9]
Some girls they're so pure
Some girls so corrupt
Some girls give me children
I only made love to her once
[Verse 10]
Give me half your money
Give me half your car
Give me half of everything
I'll make you world's biggest star by half
[Chorus]
So give me all your money
Give me all your gold
Let's go back to Zuma beach
I'll give you half of everything I own
[Verse 1]
Some girls give me money
Some girls buy me clothes
Some girls give me jewelry
