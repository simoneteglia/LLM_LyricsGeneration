[Intro]
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Did you ever wake up to find
A day that broke up your mind?
Destroyed your notion of circular time?
[Chorus]
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway
[Verse 2]
Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground
For my friends out on the burial ground
Can't stand the feeling getting so brought down
[Chorus]
It's just that evil life that got me in its sway
It's just that evil life that got me in its sway
[Bridge]
There must be ways to find out
Love is the way they say is really strutting out
[Verse 3]
Whoo
Hey, hey, hey now
One day I woke up to find
Right in the bed next to mine
Someone that broke me up with a corner of her smile, yeah
[Chorus]
It's just that demon life that got me in its sway
It's just that demon life that got me in its sway
It's just that demon life that got me in its sway
(It's just that demon life that got me in its sway)
[Outro]
It's just that demon life has got me

[Verse 2]
Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground

Can't stand the feeling getting so brought down

It's just that demon life has got me
