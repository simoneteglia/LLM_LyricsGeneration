[Verse 1]
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
[Verse 2]
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
[Chorus]
Wild horses
couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
[Verse 3]
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die
[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day
[Chorus]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day
[Verse 1]
