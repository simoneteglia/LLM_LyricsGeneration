[Verse 1]
As I stand by your flame
I get burned once again
Feeling low down, I'm blue
[Verse 2]
As I sit by the fire
Of your warm desire
I've got the blues for you, yeah
[Bridge]
Every night you've been away, a hey, a hey
I've sat down, and I have prayed
That you're safe
[Verse 3]
In the arms of a guy
Who will bring you alive
Won't drag you down with abuse
Oh
[Verse 4]
In the silk sheet of time
I will find peace of mind
Love is a bed full of blues
[Outro]
And I've got the blues for you
And I've got the blues for you
And I'll bust my brains out for you
And I'll tear my hair out
I'm going to tear my hair out just for you
If you don't believe what I'm singing
At three o'clock in the morning, babe, well
I'm singing my song for you
[Verse 1]
As I stand by your flame
I get burned once again
Feeling low down, I'm blue
[Verse 2]
As I sit by the fire
Of your warm desire
I've got the blues for you, yeah
[Bridge]
Every night you've been away, a hey, a hey
I've sat down, and I have prayed
That you're safe
[Verse 3]
In the arms of a guy
Who will bring you alive
Won't drag you down with abuse
Oh
[Verse 4]
In the silk sheet of time
I will find peace of mind
Love is a bed full of blues
[Outro]
And I've got the blues for you
And I've got the blues for you
And I'll bust my brains out for you
And I'll tear my hair out
I'm going to tear my hair out just for you
If you don't believe what I'm singing
At three o'clock in the morning, babe, well
I'm singing my song for you
