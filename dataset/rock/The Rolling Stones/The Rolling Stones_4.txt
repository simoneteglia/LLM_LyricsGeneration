Ooh, a storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away
[Chorus: Mick Jagger & Merry Clayton]
War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
, yeah

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very streets today
Burns like a red-coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children

It's just a shot away

War, children

My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away
