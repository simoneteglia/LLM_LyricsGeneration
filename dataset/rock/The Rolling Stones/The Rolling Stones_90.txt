[Verse 1]
When I come home, baby
And I've been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee, and she said
"Daddy, what's wrong?"
She whispered in my ear so sweet
You know what she said? She said
[Chorus]
"Daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
Daddy, you're a fool"
[Verse 2]
You know, I've got a woman (Daddy, you're a fool)
And she live in the poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love, so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She said, "Tell me all your troubles"
You know what she said? She said
[Chorus]
Ooh, "Daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
Daddy, you're a fool to cry"
(Oh, I love you so much, baby)
"Daddy, you're a fool to cry
Daddy, you're a fool to cry"
[Bridge]
Yeah, she said
Ooh, "Daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why"
She said
Ooh, daddy you're a fool to cry
Ooh, "Daddy, you're a fool to cry"
Ooh, "Daddy, you're a fool to cry"
Ooh, "Daddy, you're a fool to cry"
Even my friends say to me sometimes
I make out like I don't understand them
You know what they say? They say
[Chorus]
Ooh, "Daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why" (Why, why)
[Outro]
I'm a fool, baby, yeah
I'm a fool, babe, ah yeah
I'm a certified fool, ay ay, yeah
Want, want to tell you, to tell you, babe
I'm a fool, baby, ah yeah, woo
I'm a certified fool, babe, ah, ah, yeah
C'mon, yeah
I'm a fool, yeah
I'm a fool, yeah
I'm a fool
[Verse 1]
When I come home, baby

"Daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
