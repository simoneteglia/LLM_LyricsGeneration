[Verse 1:
Keith Richards
]
Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
[Verse 2: Mick Jagger]
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back-breaking work
Say a prayer for
his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth
[Bridge: Mick]
When I search a faceless crowd
A swirling mass of gray and black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact, they look so strange
[Verse 3: Mick and Keith]
Raise your glass to the hardworking people
Let's drink to the uncounted heads
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leading but get gamblers instead
[Verse 4: Mick and Keith]
Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of the gray-suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio
[Bridge: Mick]
When I look in the faceless crowd
A swirling mass of grays and black and white
They don't look real to me
Oh, don't they look so strange?
[Verse 5: Watts Street Gospel Choir]
Let's drink to the hardworking people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
[Verse 6: All]
Let's drink to the hardworking people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the two thousand million
Let's think of the humble of birth
[Outro: Choir]
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
Let's take a drink to the salt of the earth
