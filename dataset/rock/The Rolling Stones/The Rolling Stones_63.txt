[Verse 1]
You got to move
You got to move
You got to move, child
You got to move
Oh, when the Lord gets ready
You got to move
[Verse 2]
You may be high
You may be low
You may be rich, child
You may be poor
But when the Lord get ready
You got to move
[Verse 3]
You see that woman
Who walks the street
You see that police
Upon his beat
But then the Lord get ready
You got to move
[Outro]
You got to move
[Verse 1]
You got to move
You got to move
You got to move, child
You got to move
Oh, when the Lord gets ready
You got to move
[Verse 2]
You may be high
You may be low
You may be rich, child
You may be poor
But when the Lord get ready
You got to move
[Verse 3]
You see that woman
Who walks the street
You see that police
Upon his beat
But then the Lord get ready
You got to move
[Outro]
You got to move
