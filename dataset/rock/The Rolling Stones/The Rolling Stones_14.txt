[Part I]
[Intro]
(Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, you got satin shoes
Yeah, you got plastic boots
Y'all got cocaine eyes
Yeah, you got speed-freak jive, now
Can't you hear me knockin' on your window?
Can't you hear me knockin' on your door?
Can't you hear me knockin' down your dirty street?
Yeah
[Chorus 1]
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
Help me baby, ain't no stranger
[Verse 2]
Can't you hear me knockin'? Ah, are you safe asleep?
Can't you hear me knockin'? Yeah, down the gas light street, now
Can't you hear me knockin'? Yeah, throw me down the keys
Alright now
[Chorus 2]
Hear me ringing big bell tolls
Hear me singing soft and low
I've been begging on my knees
I've been kickin
', help me please
[Vocal Outro]
Hear me prowlin'
(I'm gonna take you down)
Hear me growlin'
(Yeah, I've got flat-ten feet now, now,
now, now)
Hear me howlin'
(And all, all around your street now)
Hear me knockin'
(And all, all around your town)
