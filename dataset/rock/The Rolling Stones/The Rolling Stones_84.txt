[Verse 1]
Got a sweet black angel, got a pin up girl
Got a sweet black angel up upon my wall
Well, she ain’t no singer and she ain’t no star
But she sure talk good and she move so fast
[Chorus]
But the gal in danger
Yeah de gal in chains
But she keep on pushing
Would you take her place?
She counting up the minutes
She counting up the days
She's a sweet black angel, woh
Not a sweet black slave
[Verse 2]
Ten little niggers sitting on de wall
Her brothers been a falling, falling one by one
For a judge they murdered and a judge they stole
Now de judge he going to judge her for all that he's worth
[Chorus - Outro]
Well de gal in danger
The gal in chains
But she keep on pushing
Would you do the same?
She counting up the minutes
She counting up the days
She's a sweet black angel
Not a gun toting teacher
Not a Red loving school marm
Is someone going to free her?
Free the sweet black slave
Free the sweet black slave
Free the sweet black slave
Free the sweet black slave
[Verse 1]
Got a sweet black angel, got a pin up girl
Got a sweet black angel up upon my wall
Well, she ain’t no singer and she ain’t no star
But she sure talk good and she move so fast
[Chorus]
But the gal in danger
Yeah de gal in chains
But she keep on pushing
Would you take her place?
She counting up the minutes
She counting up the days
She's a sweet black angel, woh
Not a sweet black slave
[Verse 2]
Ten little niggers sitting on de wall
Her brothers been a falling, falling one by one
For a judge they murdered and a judge they stole
Now de judge he going to judge her for all that he's worth
[Chorus - Outro]
Well de gal in danger
The gal in chains
But she keep on pushing
Would you do the same?
She counting up the minutes
She counting up the days
She's a sweet black angel
Not a gun toting teacher
Not a Red loving school marm
Is someone going to free her?
Free the sweet black slave
Free the sweet black slave
Free the sweet black slave
Free the sweet black slave
