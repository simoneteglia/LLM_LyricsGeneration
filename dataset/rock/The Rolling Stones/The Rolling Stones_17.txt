[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, go
[Verse 1]
Don't get angry with me
I never caused you no pain
I won't be angry with you
But I can't see straight (Yeah)
It hasn't rained for a month, the river's run dry
We haven't made love and I wanna know why
Why you angry with me
Why you angry?
[Chorus]
Please just forget about me, cancel out my name
Please never write to me, I love you just the same
I hear a melody ringing in my brain
Just keep the memories, don't have to be ashamed
[Verse 2]
Don't get angry with me
I'm in a dеsperate state
I'm not angry with you
Don't you spit in my facе
The wolf's at the door with the teeth and the claws
My mouth's getting sore, I can't take anymore
Why you angry with me?
Why you angry?
[Chorus]
Voices keep echoing, calling out my name
Hear the rain keep beating on my window pane
I hear a melody ringing in my brain
You can keep the memories, don't have to be ashamed
[Refrain]
Don't get angry with me
[Bridge]
Angry
Angry
[Outro]
Yeah,
angry
, yeah
Don't be angry with me
If we go separate ways
Angry
, yeah
Don't get angry with me
Let's go out in a blaze
Angry
(Yeah)
Don't be angry with me
Don't you spit in my face
Angry
(Oh)
Don't get angry with me
Don't get, don't get, don't
Angry
(Yeah)
Don't be angry with me
I'm still taking the pills
And I'm off to Brazil (
Angry

Don't be angry with me
Yeah
Please (

Don't, don't (
