[Verse 1]
My sweet
Lady Jane
, when I see you again
Your servant am I and will humbly remain
Just heed this plea, my love
On bended knees, my love
I pledge myself to Lady Jane
[Verse 2]
My dear Lady Anne
, I've done what I can
I must take my leave for promised I am
This play is run, my love
Your time has come, my love
I pledge my troth to Lady Jane
[Verse 3]
Oh my sweet Marie,
I wait at your eaves
The sands have run out for your lady and me
Wedlock is nigh, my love
Her station's right, my love
Life is secure with Lady Jane
[Verse 1]
My sweet
Lady Jane

I pledge myself to Lady Jane
[Verse 2]

I wait at your eaves
The sands have run out for your lady and me
Wedlock is nigh, my love
Her station's right, my love
Life is secure with Lady Jane
