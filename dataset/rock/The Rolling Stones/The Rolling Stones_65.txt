[Verse 1]
The streets I used to walk on
Are full of broken glass
And everywhere I'm looking
There's memories of my past
The filthy flat in Fulham
The smell of sex and gas
I never ever really knew
Where I was sleeping next
[Chorus]
When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
When all your friends have let you down
And treat you with disdain
When the whole wide world's against you
And that's got you on the run
And you think the party's over
But it's only just, only just begun
(Oh yeah)
[Verse 2]
Behind the bars of prison
You're never getting out
They wanna break your balls in those slimy walls
And the guards are lardy louts
The cameras that are watching you
They see a sullen face
Get me out the door, can't keep me in no more
I'm breaking down the gates
[Chorus]
When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
And you want someone beside you
To pull you up again
When the whole wide world's against you
And life's got you on the run
And you think the party's over
But it's only just, only just begun
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Well, the dreary streets of London
They never promised much
A dead-end job to nowhere
And all your dreams are crushed
When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
When all your friends have let you down
And treat you with disdain
And you think the party's over
But it's only just begun
Let's raise a glass, get up and dance
'Cause life's just hit and, hit and, hit and run
[Outro]
Hit and run, yeah
The party's over
(Yeah)
World's against you
[Verse 1]
The streets I used to walk on
Are full of broken glass
And everywhere I'm looking
There's memories of my past
The filthy flat in Fulham
The smell of sex and gas
I never ever really knew
Where I was sleeping next
[Chorus]
When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
When all your friends have let you down
And treat you with disdain
When the whole wide world's against you
And that's got you on the run
And you think the party's over
But it's only just, only just begun
(Oh yeah)
[Verse 2]
Behind the bars of prison
You're never getting out
They wanna break your balls in those slimy walls
And the guards are lardy louts
The cameras that are watching you

Get me out the door, can't keep me in no more
I'm breaking down the gates
[Chorus]
When the whole wide world's against you
And you're standing in the rain
And you want someone beside you
To pull you up again
When the whole wide world's against you
And life's got you on the run
And you think the party's over

Hit and run, yeah
The party's over
(Yeah)
World's against you
