[Verse 1]
Well, you've got your diamonds
And you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
[Refrain]
But don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
[Verse 2]
Your mother she's an heiress
Owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
[Refrain]
But don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
[Verse 3]
Your old man took her diamonds
And tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
[Refrain]
So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
[Verse 4]
Now you've got some diamonds
And you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother
[Outro]
So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
So don't you play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
[Verse 1]
Well, you've got your diamonds
And you've got your pretty clothes
And the chauffeur drives your car
You let everybody know
[Refrain]
But don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
[Verse 2]
Your mother she's an heiress
Owns a block in Saint John's Wood
And your father'd be there with her
If he only could
[Refrain]
But don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
[Verse 3]
Your old man took her diamonds
And tiaras by the score
Now she gets her kicks in Stepney
Not in Knightsbridge anymore
[Refrain]
So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
[Verse 4]
Now you've got some diamonds
And you will have some others
But you'd better watch your step, girl
Or start living with your mother
[Outro]
So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
So don't you play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire
