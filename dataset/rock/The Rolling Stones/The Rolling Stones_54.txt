[Verse 1]
Why you bite my head off?
Why you bite my head off?
Why you get so pissed off?
Why you bite my head off now?
Yeah, c'mon
Why you bite my head off?
Actin' such a jerk off
Why you have to mouth off?
I got the world to worry about
[Chorus]
Yeah, if I was a dog
Yeah, you would kick me down
I'd be spendin' the night
Howlin' 'round your house
But I ain't on a leash, yeah
Well, I ain't on a chain
You think I'm your bitch
I'm fuckin' with your brain, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Why'd ya bite my head off? Yeah
C'mon, c'mon
[Verse 2]
Well, life can be a riot
I can be the pilot
Provided that it's private
I got the world to worry about
What? C'mon
Now you got me drinkin'
Started to stop thinkin'
The whole fuckin' ship is sinkin', sinkin'
I'm lookin' for a quick way out
[Chorus]
Yеah, well, I'm hearin' the bark
And I'm feelin' thе bite, yeah
I'm seein' the shark
I think I gotta hide
Well, I ain't on a leash
Well, I ain't on a chain
You think I'm your bitch
I'm fuckin' with your brain, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
C'mon, Paul, let's hear something
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
C'mon

[Outro]
Well, why you bite my head off?
Just 'cause you are red hot?
Actin' like a despot
Why you bite my head off now?
Yeah, why you bite my head off?
Why you bite my head off?
Why you rip the bed up?
I got the world to worry about
