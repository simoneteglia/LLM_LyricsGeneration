[Verse 1]
No good, can't speak, wound up, no sleep
Sky diver inside her, slip rope, stunt flyer
Wounded lover, got no time on hand
[Verse 2]
One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam
Pause for business, hope you'll understand
Judge and jury walk out hand in hand
[Verse 3]
Dietrich movies
, close up boogies,
kissing cunt in Cannes
Grotesque music, million dollar sad
Got no tactics, got no time on hand
[Saxophone Solo]
[Verse 4]
Left shoe shuffle, right shoe muffle, sinking in the sand
Fade out freedom, steaming heat on, watch that hat in black
Finger twitching
, got no time on hand
[Verse 1]
No good, can't speak, wound up, no sleep
Sky diver inside her, slip rope, stunt flyer
Wounded lover, got no time on hand
[Verse 2]
One last cycle, thrill freak Uncle Sam
Pause for business, hope you'll understand
Judge and jury walk out hand in hand
[Verse 3]
Dietrich movies
, close up boogies,

Grotesque music, million dollar sad
Got no tactics, got no time on hand
[Saxophone Solo]
[Verse 4]
Left shoe shuffle, right shoe muffle, sinking in the sand
Fade out freedom, steaming heat on, watch that hat in black
Finger twitching
