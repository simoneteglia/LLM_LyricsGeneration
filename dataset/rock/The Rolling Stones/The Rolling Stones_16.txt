[Verse 1]
Everywhere I hear the sound of marchin', chargin' feet, boy
'Cause summer's here and the time is right
For fighting in the street, boy
[Chorus]
Well now, what can a poor boy do?
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man
No
[Verse 2]
Hey, think the time is right for a violence revolution
But where I live, the game to play is compromise solution
[Chorus]
Well now, what can a poor boy do?
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man
No
[Post-Chorus]
Get down
[Verse 3]
Hey, said my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream
I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
[Chorus]
Well now, what can a poor boy do?
'Cept to sing for a rock-n-roll band
'Cause in sleepy London Town
There's just no place for street fighting man
No
[Post- Chorus]
Get down
[Instrumental Outro]
