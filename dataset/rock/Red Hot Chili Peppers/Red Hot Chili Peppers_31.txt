[Verse 1]
I am a man cut from the know
Rarely do friends come and then go
She was a girl, soft but estranged
We were the two our lives rearranged
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day
[Chorus]
Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)
[Verse 2]
Raised by my dad, girl of the day
He was my man, that was the way
She was the girl left alone
Feeling the need to make me her home
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't know what, when, or why
The twilight of love had arrived
[Chorus]
Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)
