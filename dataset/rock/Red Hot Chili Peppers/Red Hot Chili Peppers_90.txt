[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Things will never be the same
Still, I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up, but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up, and then I take it off the shelf
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Everyone knows anything goes,
and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis &
John Frusciante
]
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of Scorpio's a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
(Ah-ah)
Say it now, 'cause John and Jane would like to know
(Ah-ah)
Is it safe inside your head?
Songs to serenade the dead
All along, I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and…
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Everyone knows anything goes,
and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Into the shadow showing
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go, and…
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Everyone knows anything goes,
and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes, and now
We are the loaded kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes,
and now
We are the lotus kids
Oh, better take note of this
For the story
