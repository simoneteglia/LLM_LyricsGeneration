[Verse 1]
Dusting off your savior
Well, you were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater now that I can
Always my man
Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you 'cause you made me all that I am
All in a hand
[Bridge 1]
A butterfly that flaps its wings affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra, the more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and any damage done will be all right
(Call out my name) Call out my name (Call and I came)
(Call out my name) Call and I came (Call and I came)
[Verse 2]
Dusting off your savior, forgiving any behavior
He's just a man, all in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver, anyone can
Always my man
I would never betray you, look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand, safe in your hand
You were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand
[Bridge 2]
We are the Red Hots and we're loving up the love-me-nots
The flowers in your flower pots are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and everything he does will be alright
(Call out my name) Call out my name (Call and I came)
(Call out my name) Call and I came (Call and I came)
[Outro]
Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man
[Guitar Solo]
