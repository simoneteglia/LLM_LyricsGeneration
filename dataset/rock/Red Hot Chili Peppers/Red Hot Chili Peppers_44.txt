[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
Three, four
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Hustle, bustle and so much muscle, oh
Cells about to separate
And I find it hard to concentrate, and
Temporary this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate, and
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this moment to make you my family, and
Finally, you have found something perfect, and
Finally, you have found—
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Death-defying, this mess I'm buying
It's raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate, and
Estuary is blessed, but scary
Your heart's about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate, and
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
One to treasure the rest of your days here, and
Give you pleasure in so many ways, dear, and
Finally, you have found something perfect
And, finally, you have found—
(Here we go)
[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Do you want me to show up for duty?
And, serve this woman and honor her beauty?
And, finally, you have found something perfect
And, finally, you have found...
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
...yourself with me
Will you agree to take this man into your world?
And, now, we are as one
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
My lone ranger
The heat exchanger is living in this figure eight
And I'll do my best to recreate, and
Sweet precision and soft collision, aw
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate, and
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this woman and make you my family, and
Finally, you have found someone perfect, and
Finally, you have found—
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
All I want is for you to be happy, and
Take this woman and make you my family, and
Finally, you have found someone perfect, and
Finally, you have found yourself
