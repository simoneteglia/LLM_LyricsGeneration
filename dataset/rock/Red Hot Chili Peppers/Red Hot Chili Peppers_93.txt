[Intro: Snagglepuss]
“Oh, good God in Heaven Almighty, Heavens to Murgatroyd
We've got a cataclysmic situation developing
Somebody get down here now!”
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come on, come on, baby
Let me show you what I'm talking about
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
You try to be a lady, but you're walking like a sauerkraut
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Looka— Looka like-a, like-a— Like you wanna get some
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
If you never tell a lie, then you never have to play dumb
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Dirty baby time, you're gonna take some
Pretty baby love, you're gonna make some
Little lady hearts, you're gonna break some
Kinda shady tears, you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, got a situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
[Interlude: Snagglepuss]
“Oh, God! Oh, no!
It's getting worse, worse by the minute
We're down here at Division and 5th Street
Someone, send for back up right now!”
[Verse 2]
Every other day, you say you're gonna have to bury 'em
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Famous last words from the fuckin'
Laserium
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Descendents had a record sayin' somethin' bout Milo
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
You can take the A-train, but you're gonna have to lie low
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl (Yeah!)
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Yeah! (Yeah)
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Dirty baby time, you're gonna take some
Pretty baby love, you're gonna make some
Little lady hearts, you're gonna break some
Kinda shady tears, you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, got a situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl (Yeah!)
I know we may never get out of here
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl!
