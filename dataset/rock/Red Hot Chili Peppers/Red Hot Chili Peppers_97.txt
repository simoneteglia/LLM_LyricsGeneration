[Verse 1]
The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask, and are you up to task?
The calicos of Pettibon where cultures come to clash
[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight
[Verse 2]
The cross between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland, a lovely cross to bear
[Chorus 2]
Several of my best friends know
The secrets of this town
Mary wants to raise it up
And Sherry wants to spin it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses
[Outro]
Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, then I say I want to
The story knows that I will never taunt you
Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, then I say I want to
The story knows that I will always haunt you
