[Intro]
Could you turn up the track a little bit please?
[Verse 1]
My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth would not be true
Refuse the news
I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Just lose and lose
[Verse 2]
First time I saw you
You were sitting backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love
[Chorus]
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
[Verse 3]
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
'Cause the one that hurts can give so much
You gave me such
[Chorus]
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
