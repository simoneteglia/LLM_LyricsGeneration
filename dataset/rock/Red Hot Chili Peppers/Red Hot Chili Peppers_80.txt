[Verse 1]
They say in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you've made it
Oh, I, do you?
A funny thing, a king who gets himself assassinated
Hey now, every time I lose altitude
[Verse 2]
You took a town by storm, the mess you made was nominated
Oh, I, do you?
Now put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've overstayed it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude
[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
[Verse 3]
The medicated state of mind you've found is overrated
Oh, I, do you?
You saw it all come down and now it's time to imitate it
Hey now, every time I lose altitude
[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
[Bridge]
Come on, God, do I seem bulletproof?
[Chorus]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune faded
