[Verse 1]
I was brave and I love my cuz
She was wavin' that dope man up
Banged a mom ’cause I see no future
Sat her down when I poured that tea
I don't know 'cause I got big temper
Stick close to my rainbow side
Candy corn and that dancing leopard
That’s all, folks, that's all
[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl that'll make you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There’s a cry for help and I don’t deny
[Verse 2]
I don't know, but it’s finally just one more mile
Peaches are sold and all givin' up on that Humpty style
At the Caldwell 'cross from the blacktop
She's Eurasian
, met her at the Quick Stop
We danced at Tito’s Go Go
Girlfriend's back, now she's gone solo
[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl that'll make you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There's a cry for help and I don't deny
[Verse 3]
Wet my beak and I give it up to that drugstore nose
So unique and I live it up 'til that liquor store close
In the laundry, queen ballistic
Mangy face with the messed up lipstick
My thing is blacked out loco
Smoke and tears, now take my photo, 'cause
[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl that'll make you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There's a cry for help and I don't deny
I don't deny
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Bangin' hard with those daddy issues
Hanging out with that Chevron dude
Knocked her out, so I let her kiss you
Redneck fights, ah, Hercules bit you
Big box, hoppin' on detox
Fast food trash when you're livin' in the crosswalk
Catch me out like motel hoes do
Blood on fries, now that's my go-to
[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl who makes you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There's a cry for help and I don't deny
I don't deny
