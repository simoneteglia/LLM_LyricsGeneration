[Verse 1]
Live and die before I get it done, will you decide?
Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago, I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere, just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme, you are the rise
And when you hear this, you’ll know it’s your jam, it’s your goodbye
[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
[Verse 2]
We all crossed when we were feeling lost it's just the time
Kateri cried the day her lover died she recognized
Because he gave her a life of real love it's no surprise
The nights are long but the years are short when you're alive
Way back when will never be again, it was a time
It's going to catch you so glad I met you to walk the line
[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
[Bridge]
Let me live so when it's time to die even the reaper cries
Let me die so when it's time to leave another sun will rise
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
[Outro]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
