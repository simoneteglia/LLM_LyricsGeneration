[Intro: Chad Smith,
Anthony Kiedis
]
One, two
If I want to—
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
She's the one, she's the only one
She's got ripped back light, gonna make me come
I say, when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
I said, now I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you
(Ah-ah)
see me and that is why
I hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel
(Ah-ah)
your fire jump up to meet
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
I said, now I'll take it,
it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it,
'cause that's what we do
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
,
and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
(Oh, yeah!)
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set
(Ah-ah)
my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched
(Ah-ah)
out mouth and a pack of style
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
I say, she's the one, she's the only one
Make me search
(Ah-ah)
myself until I'm done, and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea
(Ah-ah)
of stars make a diagram?
And—
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Something out there,
where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
, and
Someone to spare
when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Oh, yeah!
Hey, yeah!
Hey!
(Oh, yeah!)
[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
So alive, I arrive on dust
You can search
(Ah-ah)
my mind for the red on rust
I said, take me there and she really cares
Lighten up
(Ah-ah)
for me, gonna hear my prayers
I said—
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Now, I'll take it,
it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it,
'cause that's what we do
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Something out there,
where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
, and
Someone to spare when
love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better now
