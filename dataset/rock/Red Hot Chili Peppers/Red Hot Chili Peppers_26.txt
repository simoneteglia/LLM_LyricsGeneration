[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
That's right, you're right, we will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time, you're fine, just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend we would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go, you show me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis &
Anna Waronker
]
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Complete repeat sittin' in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel, take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound, turn it up and no we canâ€™t be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep, find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis &
Anna Waronker
]
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
That's right, you're right, we will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time, you're fine, just another color coded crime
The song is fascination
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside the lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis &
Anna Waronker
]
A May-December might not be so smart
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Don't be late 'cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays
