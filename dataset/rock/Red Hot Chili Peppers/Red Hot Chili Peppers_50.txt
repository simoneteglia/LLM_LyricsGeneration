[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
All alone, not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all through someone else and I—
(Another girl bad for my health)
A-celebrated, but undisturbed
And serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, oh
(Serenaded by the terror bird)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling blackout of oblivion
And I like to think that I'm your number one, now—
(Now, I'm rolling blackout of oblivion)
I wanna leave, but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck and I'm—
(I'm a broken record runnin' low on luck)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Oh-oh)
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
(Oh-oh)
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice, she enjoys
(Oh-oh)
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed
We could all go down
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish, but I'm quick to start
And beneath the heather lies the meadowlark and I'm—
(Slow to finish, but I'm quick to start)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face, my face
[Outro: John Frusciante]
Yeah
