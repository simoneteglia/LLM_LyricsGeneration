[Verse 1]
Does it go from a-east to west, y'all
Body free and a body less, y'all
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in, coming through the mesh, y'all
Checking in just to get it blessed, y'all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam
[Chorus]
Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?
[Verse 2]
Do it all then it all again, y'all
Make it up and you make a friend, y'all
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend, y'all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, y'all
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
[Chorus]
Where you come from, where you going?
Where you come from, where you going?
[Bridge]
We all want to tell her, tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her, tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever...
[Outro 1]
I know you said you don't believe
In God, do you still disagree?
Now that it's time for you to leave
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
[Outro 2]
Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
[Outro 3]
And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of all I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
[Outro 4]
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave
G-L-O-R-I-A is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
