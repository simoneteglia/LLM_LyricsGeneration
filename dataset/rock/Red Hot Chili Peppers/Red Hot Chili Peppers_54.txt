[Verse 1]
Standing naked in your kitchen
Feeling free that I could be alive
Clearly, I'm a contradiction
Too young to be my wife
A peaceful storm is never hectic
Her mellow voice that I could be within
The uniform is anorexic
A jealous choice won't win
[Pre-Chorus]
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why
I got a metamorphosis samurai
[Verse 2]
Paint your face cause I'm a black foot
I thought I counted up the fireflies
Close enough to get a good look
Time to mobilize
[Pre-Chorus]
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why
I got a metamorphosis samurai
[Chorus]
I'm a lonely lad, I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much so don't ask me I've gone insane
[Verse 3]
Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies
The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown
[Chorus]
I'm a lonely lad, I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much so don't ask me I've gone insane
[Verse 4]
Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown
Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can
[Chorus]
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
[Outro]
See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane
