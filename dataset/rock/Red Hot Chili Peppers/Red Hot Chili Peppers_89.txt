[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
One shot, all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed
'Til death do us part
Break my heart so I can start
[Pre-Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist it's
Time to get on top of this
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
It's right on time
It's right on time
(
It's right on time
) It's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time
(
It's right on time
) Looking fine, you're looking fine, let's get on 1999
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here, I'm nowhere now
[Pre-Chorus 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
It's right on time
It's right on time
(
It's right on time
) It's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time, it's right on time
(
It's right on time
) Looking fine, you're looking fine, let's get on 1999
[Bridge: John Frusciante]
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row, let us go
It's time to blow up for the show
[Pre-Chorus 3: Anthony Kiedis]
All the world reverberated
Coming through, we motorcaded
Start up when we operated
Turning up in solid stated
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Oh, Lord!
