[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 2]
Ah, push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause
[Chorus]
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 3]
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 4]
Soft-spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and
[Chorus]
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
