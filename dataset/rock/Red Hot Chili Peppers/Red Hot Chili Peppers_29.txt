[Verse 1]
Lipstick junkie, debunk the all in one she
Came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me that wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial, it's just a turn-around
[Interlude]
And we go, oh
Well and we go, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Tic-toc,
I want to rock you like the '80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd? We better get it on the go
[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud
[Chorus 2]
I said hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
[Verse 3]
Rain dance Maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know her body was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods, I want to lick a little bit
[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud
[Bridge]
You got the wrong girl
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, girl
[Chorus 1]
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to and showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud
[Chorus 3]
I said hey, now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to and showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
[Outro]
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, bye, bye, bye, yeah
Bye bye, bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye
