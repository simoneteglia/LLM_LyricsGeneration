[Verse 1]
Easily, let's get carried away
Easily, let's get married today
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat
Everything must go
A licking stick is thicker when you break it to show
Everything must go
[Chorus 1]
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
[Verse 2]
Easily, let's get caught in a wave
Easily, we won't get caught in a cage
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go
[Chorus 2]
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go
[Chorus 3]
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know you're coming back
[Instrumental Outro]
