[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
She's only eighteen, don't like the Rolling Stones
She took the short cut to being fully grown
She's got that mood ring
,
a little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
,
a pair of pantyhose
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
She said, “My man, you know, it's time to get your fingers wet”
Your hustle's busted when you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you, you were screaming
“Handle it!”
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Knock the world
, right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love
will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated
by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds, and light will shed
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
I heard some P-Funk out on the road again
To get your head shrunk, is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline, a perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine, I'm going to make you mine
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
It's understood, you wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque
I put my loving in your oven not a head to check
The last I heard from you, you were screaming “Resurrect!”
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Knock the world
, right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love
will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated
by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds, and light will shed
(Uuh)
[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante,
Anthony Kiedis
]
Haha!
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Knock the world
, right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love
will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated
by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds, and light will shed
