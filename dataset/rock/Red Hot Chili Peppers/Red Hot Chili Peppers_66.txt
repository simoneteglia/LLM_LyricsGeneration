[Verse 1]
This is my time, this is my tear
I can see clearly now that this is not a place for playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time, this is my tear
[Verse 2]
Comin' on strong, Baudelaire
Seems to me like all the world gets high when you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime
[Chorus]
All in all and I'm loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this
In the end and then all will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give
[Post-Chorus]
Say it now because you never know
[Verse 3]
Devil may cry, Devil may care
Distiller's got a scream an' now I know just why when she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
California skies got room to spare
This is my time
[Chorus]
All in all and I'm loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this
In the end and then all will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give
[Post-Chorus]
Say it now because you never know
Aw, never know
[Guitar Solo]
[Trumpet Solo]
[Verse 4]
Take it outside, take it out there
Seems to me like all the world gets high when you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time
[Chorus]
All in all and I'm loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take breath to be sure of this
In the end and then all will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I gave what I came to give
[Post-Chorus]
Say it now because you never know
Aw, never know
