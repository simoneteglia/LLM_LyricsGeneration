[Verse 1]
Close to my skin, I'm falling in someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone, I'm left alone in another zone
John says to live above hell and my will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail and my will could sail, yeah
[Verse 2]
It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste of being face-to-face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone, I listen to our secret theme
[Chorus]
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
[Verse 2]
Sailin' for the sun, 'cause there is one that knows where I'm from
I care for you, I really do, I really do
Come closer now so you can lie right by my side
I sit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you gettin' over myself, yeah
[Chorus]
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
[Outro]
Close to my skin, someone who's been, I'm a-falling in
Disasters are just another star falling in my yard
John says to live above hell and my will is well
Long to be with someone to tell "I love your smell"
