[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all, I want it bad
Ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh, it's what I know
A vintage year for pop I hear, the middle of the end is near
Let's
go, oh-oh-oh-oh
It's
what I know
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
Torture me and torture me
Forcing me and so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time)
Forcing me, so torture me, please
(Whoa)
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's
go, oh-oh-oh-oh
It's
what I know
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
Torture me and torture me
It's forcing me and so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time)
Forcing me, so torture me, please
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill, let's
go
Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound is
so—
But all the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around, let's go
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near, it's so—
(Oh!)
[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me and torture me
(Oh, no, my time)
It's forcing me, so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time, baby)
Forcing me, so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me and torture me
(Oh, no, my time)
It's forcing me and so torture me, please
(Oh, no, my Lord)
Torture me with sorcery
(Oh, no, my time)
Forcing me, so torture me, please
