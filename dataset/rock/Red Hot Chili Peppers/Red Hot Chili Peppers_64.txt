[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl, you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
Balleradio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The love of a Martian
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I—
Lots of love just keep it comin'
(Ah)
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know what to say
(Ah)
Look at what I've lost today
And
these are the things that I—
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The love of a Martian
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Let's bow our heads and let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone, God bless her little soul
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante

Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I—
Lots of love just keep it comin'
(Ah)
Makin' somethin' out of nothin'
These are the best that I—
I don't know what to say
(Ah)
Look at what I've lost today
And
these are the things that I—
(Ha-ah-ha-ah)
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
She's got sword in case, though this is not her Lord in case
The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace
Disappeared, no trace, musky tears, suitcase
The downturn brave little burncub
Bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages
Down and out, but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages, no loft
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop
Dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt
Cough go, drink it's— It's for you!
Blue battered naval town slip kisses, delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race, a shehive stare and chase
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box, in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness, before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket
Your ilk is funny to the turnstile touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternight's fallen freckles away!
