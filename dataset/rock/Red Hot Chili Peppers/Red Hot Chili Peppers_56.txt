[Verse 1]
People, keep on learnin'
Soldiers, keep on warrin'
The world, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
A-powers will keep on lyin'
While your people will keep on dyin'
The world, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground
[Verse 2]
A-teachers, a-keep on teachin'
A-preachers, a-keep on preachin'
World, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long (oh no)
Lovers, a-keep on lovin'
While believers keep on believin'
Sleepers, just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long, oh no
[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground
[Outro]
And
Stevie
knows that, uh, nobody's gonna bring me down
('Til I reach the highest ground)
'Cause me and Stevie, see, we're gonna be sailing on the funky funky sound
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Bustin' out, and I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailing on
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Just, uh, sailin' on, sailin' on to higher ground
('Til I reach the highest ground)
