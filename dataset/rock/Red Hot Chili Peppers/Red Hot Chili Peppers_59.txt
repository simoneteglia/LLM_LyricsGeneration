[Intro]
(Get on top)
(Get on top)
Hit me (Get on top), come get me
I bite but (Get on top) she bit me
[Verse 1]
Go-rilla, cunt-illa
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill but I'm iller
[Bridge 1]
I'mma linger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top
[Chorus]
(Get on top) Complications of a mastermind
(Get on top) Last temptation of my kind
(Get on top) Extra planetary sign when do we align
(Get on top) All in time
Right on
[Interlude]
Get up (Get on top), come sit up
I light but (Get on top) she lit up
[Verse 2]
Grasshopper, show stopper
The life of a wife swapper (Get on top)
Come with me 'cause I'm a big bopper
You do but I wopper (Get on top)
[Bridge 2]
Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws
[Chorus]
(Get on top) Complications of a mastermind
(Get on top) Last temptation of my kind
(Get on top)
Extra planetary sign when do we align
(Get on top) All in time
Right on
[Guitar Solo]

Hit me (Get on top), come get me
I bite but (Get on top) she bit me

Speed baller
, Rhodes Scholar
Bottom bitch and a bottom dollar
Come with me 'cause I'm a free faller
You hoot but I holler
[Bridge 1]
I'mma linger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock on
Set you up to get on top
[Outro]
Get on top
Get on top
