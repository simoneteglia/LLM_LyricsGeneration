[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
My shadow side so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary son, but it's so...
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent, why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go
You're the best I know
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen are
Treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro
[Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
My, what a good day for a, a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My, what a good day for a, a take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of...
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary son, but it's so...
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty goin' toe to toe
[Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
My, what a good day for a "let it slide"
I'd like to say we did it for the better of...
[Chorus 2: Anthony Kiedis]
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
Hell
[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis &
John Frusciante

(Uh-uh-uh)
Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
(Uh-uh-uh)
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show
[Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better of...
Hell
[Chorus 2: Anthony Kiedis]
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante

Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do (
Yeah
)
You don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do
Yeah!
