[Verse 1]
Kick back a little just to watch and see
Gettin' sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinkin' baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it were so when you told me
That you were solid gold
[Verse 2]
Gravity-free is she, look at her
Highness on a mattress full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
Your smell or your go to hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it probably will not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how did I get
Your lipstick on my kite?
[Chorus]
I love this weather, it's a perfect storm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
I love this weather 'cause it keeps me warm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back)
[Verse 3]
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Oh, lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind in a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terrible is a soul, when she told me
That there is such a thing
Do you know that you glow when you go
From winter into spring
[Chorus]
I love this weather, it's a perfect storm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
I love this weather 'cause it keeps me warm
(Come back, come back, hey la la)
Just keep it comin' in its perfect form
(Come back)
[Bridge]
The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick get strong
Mad boy, sad song
A wicked fate, but the sick get strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on fourth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick get...
[Verse 1]
Kick back a little just to watch and see
Gettin' sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinkin' baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold
[Outro]
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
I stand before then there's no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you (no)
My heart is swollen when I search you (no)
I swear to god I could not hurt you (no)
I swear to god I could not hurt you (no)
I've got to be inside your virtue (no)
I can't contain my urge to search you (no)
