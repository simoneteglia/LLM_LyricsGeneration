[Verse]
I'm a little pea
I love the sky and the trees
I'm a teeny, tiny little ant
Checking out this and that
And I am nothing
Ah, so you have nothing to hide
And I'm a pacifist
So I can fuck your shit up
Oh yeah, I'm small
Oh yeah, I'm small
[Bridge]
Fuck you, asshole
You homophobic, redneck dick
You're big and tough and macho
You can kick my ass
[Outro]
So fucking what?
So fucking what?
So fucking what?
So fucking what?
