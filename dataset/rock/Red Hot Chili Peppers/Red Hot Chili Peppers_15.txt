[Verse 1]
I got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze
Well all the love from me
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams, yeah
Have turned to demons of greed, that's mean
[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
[Verse 2]
Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
I’ll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
[Guitar Solo]
[Interlude]
Yeah!
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Oh so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction
It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
A holy rollercoaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river, let me on your shore
Well, I'll be coming back baby, I'll be coming back for more
[Bridge]
Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
I could not forget but I will not endeavour
Simple pleasures are much better, but I won’t regret it, never
[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
[Outro]
Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time
