[Verse 1]
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will
[Verse 2]
Ex-girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate on the prison phone
They want to give her seven years
For being sad
[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
[Verse 3]
My friends are so distressed
And standing on the brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness
[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Imagine me
Taught by tragedy
Release is peace
[Verse 4]
I heard a little girl
And what she said was something beautiful
"To give your love no matter what"
Was what she said
[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
