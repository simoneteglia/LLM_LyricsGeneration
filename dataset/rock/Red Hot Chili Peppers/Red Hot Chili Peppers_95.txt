[Verse 1]
All my life I was
Swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple
Never playing good defense
Gunnin' for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there
So I couldn't really get her
I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
[Verse 2]
Piece of work
I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore,
A busy mind could go berserk
Oh, feast on this
I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip
And I opened up the book
[Pre-Chorus]
I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?
[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of
[Verse 3]
Crack your whip
She's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there
But not as much for round-trip

I was slippin' in and out
Of every other sex machine
[Pre-Chorus]
I said factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Makes you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?
[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Be my wife
I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
Late last night I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends I've got a factory of faith
I've got a factory of
[Outro]
Faith
And love
Lo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
