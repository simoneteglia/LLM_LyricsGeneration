[Verse 1]
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin?
Are you missing the love of your kin?
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile?
Can you bear not to share with your child?
Drifting and floating and fading away
[Chorus]
Little lune, all day
Little lune
[Verse 2]
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb?
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin?
Are you missing the love of your kin?
Nodding and melting and fading away
[Chorus]
Little lune, all day
Little lune
Little lune, all day
Little lune
