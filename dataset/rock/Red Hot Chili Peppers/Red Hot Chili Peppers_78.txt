[Verse 1]
I'm not the person that you thought I was
I'm not the one you thought you knew
I'd do most anything to make you think that I'm the one
I'd do it all to get to you
[Verse 2]
You see me as the perfect compliment
You think that I'm someone to choose
You see me in a way that makes me want to reinvent
A person I could turn into
[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run
Blue strides are callin' and I can't stop fallin'
Give me the lovе and I'll tell you when I wanna run
[Verse 3]
I don't look like mysеlf in photographs
Long days of time have been unkind
I miss the you, the one that makes me want to redefine
I'm not the one you fell into
I'm not the one, the one for you
[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run
Blue strides are callin' and I can't stop fallin'
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna run
Blue strides are calling and I can't stop fallin'
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna run
