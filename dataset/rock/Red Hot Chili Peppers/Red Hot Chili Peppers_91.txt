[Verse 1]
I change the key from C to D
You see, to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
[Chorus]
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Post-Chorus]
You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Catfight intimidation
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
To read a mind you've got to re-
Define the line to make your circle sing, y'all
He knows everything
You make a sound, the spell is bound
To come around, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
[Chorus]
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Post-Chorus]
You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Catfight intimidation
All out interfacing
Black star motivation
Vampire, sugar junkie
Databasing infiltration
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
I change the key from C to D
You see, to me, it's just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, y'all
He knows everything
[Chorus]
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
It's just a minor thing and I'm a minor king
[Guitar Solo Outro]
