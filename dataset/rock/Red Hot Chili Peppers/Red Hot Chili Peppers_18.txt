[Verse 1]
I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't take these things so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore
[Verse 2]
Somebody hooted and they hollered, "Can I buy a vowel"
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore
[Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think that it's so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore
[Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
[Verse 4]
I'm kissin' high and low, our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore
[Chorus]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
