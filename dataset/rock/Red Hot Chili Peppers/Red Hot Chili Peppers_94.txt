[Verse 1]
I used to shout across the room to you
And you’d come dancin’ like a fool
Aw, shuffle step, you funky mother
Come to me, all warm as covers
Rest with me, my lovely brother
For you see, there is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I’ll see you soon, save me a seat
[Chorus 1]
Oh, well, I’m cryin’ now, my lovely man
Oh, yes, I’m cryin’ now, and no one can
Will ever fill the, the hole you left, my man
I'll see you later, my lovely man, if I can
[Verse 2]
In my room, I’m all alone
Yeah, waitin’ for ya to get home
I listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won’t come back
[Chorus 2]
Oh well, I’m cryin’ now, my lovely man
I’ll see you later, my lovely man, if I can
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Just in case you never knew
I miss you, Slim, I love you, too
See, my heart, it’s black and blue
When I die, I will find you
[Chorus 3]
Oh, well, I’m cryin’ now, my lovely man
Oh, yes, I’m cryin’ now, and no one can
Will ever fill the, the hole you left, my man
I’ll see you later, my lovely man, if I can
[Outro]
Well, I’m cryin’, lovely man, yeah, oh-oh
Well, I’m cryin’, yeah, there now, oh, a-love, man
Oh, I miss you,
ben adam
, I love you, man
I’ll see you later, my lovely man
We had some good time, my lovely man
Yeah
Bo-bo-bo
