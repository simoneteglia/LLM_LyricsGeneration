[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Well, separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat, it's all I ever
[Verse 1]
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Verse 2]
Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
A stranger thing could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on
[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever
[Verse 3]
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She want to know am I still a slut?
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Verse 4]
A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidature for the soul mate bled
Mmm, push the trigger and I pull the thread
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on
[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down, and then it's born again
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever had
[Outro]
(How long?)
I don't, I don't believe itâ€™s sad
A-slittin' my throat, is all I ever
