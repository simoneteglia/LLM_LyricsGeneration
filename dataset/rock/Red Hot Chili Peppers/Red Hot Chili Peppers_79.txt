[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
[Verse 1]
I see you in the park, you're always wearing Dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and anyone from any other crew
I am small but I'm strong, I'll get it on with you
If you want me to, what else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue from anything you do
If you want them to, what else can they do?
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
[Verse 2]
I'll come around and make peace, get down, have a barbeque
Let's keep the moon awake and do electric boogaloo
I am small but I'm strong, you see I'm just like you
If you only knew that I'm just like you
All the world would take a cue from anything you do
If you only knew that they're just like you
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
I don't want to fight, I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
[Bridge]
If you want me to, what else can I do?
'Cause I'm just like you if you only knew
[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
