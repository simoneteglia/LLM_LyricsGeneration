[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Looks to me like heaven sent no lullaby kid, no five percent
Any way you wanna cut that cake
She's dyin' from the likes of abandonment
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Lost in the valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
It looked to me like heaven sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Who's gonna take you home and hold you when things aren't so bright?
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
It's a long walk down those tracks, it's a dirty walk in, it's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn a-way too much shootin' dope in the back of a Cadillac, Jack
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
It looked to me like heaven sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Who's gonna take you home and hold you when things aren't so bright?
She looks to me, she looks to me
, all right
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
Down in the South Seas, give me your mouth, please
Resuscitation is the way I found these
(Aah)
I give you major, you give me minor
Don't fade away like an ocean liner now
[Guitar Solo: John Frusciante]
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
She shows the world up with a smile and then she throws the fight
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Down on the bathroom floor, she's searching for another light
She looks to me, she looks to me
, all right
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
She looked to me like heaven sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Who's gonna take you home and hold you when things aren't so bright?
She looks to me, she looks to me
