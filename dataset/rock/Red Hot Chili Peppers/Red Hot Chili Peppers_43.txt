[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Won't somebody come along and teach me how to keep it alive to survive?
Come along and show me something that I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But, now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
[Guitar Solo (1/3): John Frusciante]
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Let it on, I'll cut you off when you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know that everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But, now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
[Guitar Solo (2/3): John Frusciante]
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do
I don't wanna have to, but I will
, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
, but that's what I'm about to do
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis,

(Hey)
Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may
(Oh)
Say it again and I'll come around, but not for the last time
(Hey)
Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name
(Oh)
Play it again and I'll come around
, come around
But not for the last time
, not for the last time
[Guitar Solo (3/3): John Frusciante]
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret
And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta get away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
