[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:29]
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry
[Verse 2]
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
Love me, I say, yeah, yeah
(One time)
[Outro]
(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(Away)
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
(Away)
Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah
(Away)
Where I'll stay
