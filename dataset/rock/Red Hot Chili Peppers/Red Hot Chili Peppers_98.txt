[Verse 1]
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down, get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
[Chorus 1]
Well I like dirt, well I like dirt, well I like dirt
[Bridge 1]
The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream, live in a dream
[Verse 1]
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down, get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
[Chorus 2]
I like dirt, I like dirt
I like dirt, I like dirt
[Verse 2]
Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better, get it to go
[Chorus 1]
Well I like dirt, well I like dirt, well I like dirt
[Bridge 2]
Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream
In your spring, live in a dream
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet, better get it to go
[Chorus 2]
I like dirt, I like dirt
I like dirt, I like dirt
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down, get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
[Chorus 2]
I like dirt, I like dirt
I like dirt, I like dirt
[Outro]
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
