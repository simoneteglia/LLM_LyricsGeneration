[Verse 1]
Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on?
[Refrain]
Take a look it's on display for you
Comin' down, no, not today
[Verse 2]
Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
[Refrain]
Pickin' up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on
[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
[Post-Chorus]
Fly on my wind
[Verse 3]
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
[Refrain]
Take a look it's on display, for you
Comin' down, no not today
[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
[Post-Chorus]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, do you
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, want to
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
[Post-Chorus]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're gonna live forever
[Outro]
Forever
