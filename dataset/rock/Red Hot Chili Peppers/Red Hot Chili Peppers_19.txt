[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do?
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
Take it away, I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
In you, a star is born and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way I knew that it would be with you
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do?
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Way up on the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon, I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
