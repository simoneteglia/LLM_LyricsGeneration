[Verse 1]
Melle Mel and Richard Hell were dancing at the Taco Bell
When someone heard a Rebel Yell, I think it was an infidel
Adam Ant
and
Robert Plant
, the banter of a sycophant
Enlisted by Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant
Islamabad is on the nod, Havana and the riot squad
And if you want to be a Mod, you'll have to meet me at the quad
[Refrain]
You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note
[Verse 2]
Parliament's Atomic Dog, thе hats were filling up with fog
Talk about the lifе and death of every penny analogue
The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin
Lizzy looking mighty Thin
,
the Thomson's had another Twin
My daughter won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me
Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like your pottery
[Chorus]
I will be your poster child
You know, the world is ours for a little while
And then, I will be your poster child tonight, ow
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum
[Verse 3]
A funky feast of Sandinista
, Neon mono Mona Lisa
Judas Priest the sweet barista, mother load was named Teresa
Bubble gum I cum Bazooka, Dirty Dan, Dean and Deluca
Smoked banana in your hookah
,
now I know the brand is RVCA
Bernie Mac and Caddy Shack were dusty as the brickerbrac
And if you ask me for the time I'll tell you that The Future's Back
[Refrain]
You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note
[Verse 4]
Steve Miller and Duran Duran, a joker dancing in the sand
Van Morrison, the Astral Man, a festival they have in Cannes
Speak of Chico and the Man, the silence of a certain lamb
MC5 kick out the jam, a poncho full of contraband
Dairy Queen
was on the scene, the EveryKid teen magazine
The Motorhead and Mr. Clean, my piston needed Valvoline
[Chorus]
I will be your poster child
You know, the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum
[Bridge]
You got me on this
Well, and I can't get off
With no one else but you
You turn me on, too
Well, and I can't get up (Ooh)
For no one else but you
[Verse 5]
Creem Magazine,
a Love Supreme
,
the ballad of a Billie Jean
And now we know the Status Quo
,
but God will never Save the Queen
Dave Mushegain
Copenhagen
,
cowboy ghost of Ronald Reagan
Dollar save was Flavor-Flavin', Cosmic rays of Carl Sagan
Hammer fist, a double kiss, unlisted number purple mist
The Chubby Checker do the twist, and everyone's a narcissist
[Refrain]
You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note
[Verse 6]
The waterbed was taking meds,
Devo with their hats of red
A fatty for the Natty Dread, a pocket full of Talking Heads
Maya's making Paper Planes
,
addiction to the days of Janes
My Slurpee's made of Purple Rain, ten fingers in the lion's mane
Giant squid, Karate Kid, Sid Vicious, and the katydid
The planet that we must forbid
,
The English Beat
are in
Madrid
[Chorus]
I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum
I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum-dum
