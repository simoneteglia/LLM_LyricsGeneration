[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
Whoa!
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Forty detectives this week
Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down Love Street
Strollin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-defendant?
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh, no!)
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump, bump
(Whoa!)
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
It must have been a hundred miles, or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear, but the way we make out
When I was another loner, nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm— I'm wide awake now
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Workin' the beat, as we speak
Workin' the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-dependent?
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump, bump
(C'mon!)
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
It must have been a hundred miles, or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear, but the way we make out
When I was another loner, nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm— I'm wide awake now
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya, gon' shake ya)
(Gon' getchya)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
(Oh, no!)
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump, bump
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Listen to me, what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and a chance to make out
Livin' in a citadel, it's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll and I am wide awake now
It must have been a hundred miles, or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear, but the way we make out
When I was another loner, nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now
