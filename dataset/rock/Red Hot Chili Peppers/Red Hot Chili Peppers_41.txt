[Verse 1]
Sailing the Sunset Strip, I'm a bit of a king
Granny will take a trip
, I'll be bending the string
Got hammers in both my hands
, such a delicate touch
They say I'm from Amsterdam, does that make me Dutch?
[Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me, Lord and children
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983
[Verse 2]
Smokin' the reefer, feeling my own life
My brother's a keeper
, I married a TV wife
The devil's Camaro parkеd in a high school lot
A leather sombrero 'causе
teacher was way too hot
[Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me, listen, Lord, now
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983
[Bridge]
Tell my love, but leave me never
Can't complain about the weather
Snowing at
the Rainbow
, have a ball
Cut my teeth down at
the Whiskey
GTOs tried to kiss me
One more song, they have seen it all
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me, what I say, Lord
Please don't remember me, it's only 1980
It's only 1983
[Post-Chorus]
Please don't remember me for what I did with David
You know I'm talkin' David Lee, am I ready?
Please don't remember me for what I did last night, oh
I guess I played a Flying V
[Instrumental Outro]
