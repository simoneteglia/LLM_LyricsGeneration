[Verse 1]
You are my God, you are my dog
You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said fuck off
Said your brother's a real punk rocker
[Chorus]
Something's going to happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me, Lord, over the moon
[Verse 2]
Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are for one and all
All we are is leaves that fall
That's all
[Bridge 1]
Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you
[Verse 3]
'Round and 'round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul
[Chorus]
Something's going to happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me, Lord, over the moon
[Verse 4]
Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creation's tortured souls
Choices are for one and all
All we are are leaves that fall
[Interlude]
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
Like no other, I love you, you're my brother
[Bridge 2]
Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood
Will never be understood
[Outro 1]
Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey, mother may
Have lost a child but she gave birth
To a loving stream
Oh, never know
When the gods will come and take you
To a loving stream
Oh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me
Were from your loving stream
In a loving stream
[Outro 2]
Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream
Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In a loving stream
