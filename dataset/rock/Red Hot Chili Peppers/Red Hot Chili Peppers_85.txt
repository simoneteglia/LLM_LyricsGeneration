[Verse 1]
She's a box car rollin' by
Like a black star in the sky
She's a failure once or twice
Like a trailer spinnin' out upon dizzy ice
[Pre-Chorus]
Flowers fly when we grow old
Snakes get high, or so I'm told
She's an eagle out on the road
Like my favorite Beatle everyone bought and sold
[Chorus]
All of my love and half my kisses
Superstar go do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free
[Verse 2]
She's a rain bird on the prowl
Like an urge to be yourself that you won't allow
She's a forest that we burned
Just a blueprint for a life that we had never learned
[Pre-Chorus]
Flowers fly when we grow old
Snakes get high, or so I'm told
She's a lynch mob on the street
Take another step and I will kill the beat
[Chorus]
All of my love and half my kisses
Superstar go do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
She's a bus stop,
glockenspiel
She's a simulation life that you thought was real
She's an image that we blurred
It's a pixelated panther, now let it purr
[Chorus]
All of my love and half my kisses
Superstar go do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free
[Outro]
I just want the great apes to be free
I just want the great apes to be free
