[Verse: Anthony Kiedis]
Life is my friend, rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon, especially in Michigan
Well, I could be your friend
White clouds, I'm in a mitten full of fisherman
C'mon, Huckleberry Finn, show me how to make her grin
Well, I'm in Michigan
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Cry me a future where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
(A rainy Lithuanian, who's dancing as an Indian)
(Painted in my tiger skin, especially in Michigan)
Double chins and bowling pins
, unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine, I find it when I'm slipping in
(The tainted new librarian, who fainted when she tucked you in)
Well, I'm in Michigan
(Let's float away like zeppelins on stoic gusts of Northern wind)
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Cry me a future where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck
Out on the farm, we'll be swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten
Where lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck
[Guitar Solo: Omar Rodríguez-López]
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
John Frusciante
]
Life is my friend, underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min, a porcelain that comes in twins
(Throw me in the loony bin, 'cause I can take it on the chin)
When I’m in Michigan
(The cleavage of your pillow skin is moving like a violin)
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Cry me a future where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis]
Out on the farm, we'll be swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten
Where lions and tigers come running just to steal your luck
Uh-uck, uh-uck
Yeah
