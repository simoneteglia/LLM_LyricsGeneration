[Verse 1]
Find me in the suburbs and the shadow of decay
Rolling rings of rubber and the band begins to play
Am I on the right side of the left side of your brain?
Can you see the rising of old yesterday's remains?
Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness
[Chorus]
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
[Verse 2]
The Stooges and J Dilla, yeah, they tore this town apart
Put me back together, well, I guess that's quite an art
Henry won the war you see but not with pen or sword
He did it with the little thing I think it's called a Ford
Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness
[Chorus]
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry, baby, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
[Outro]
Everything's so hazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy, I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Everything's so hazy
