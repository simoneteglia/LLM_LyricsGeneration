[Verse 1]
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder to tell what came first, um
Underwater where thoughts can breathe easily
Far away you were made in a sea, just like me
[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
[Verse 2]
Staring straight up into the sky, oh, my, my
A solar system that fits in your eye, microcosm
You could die but you're never dead, spider web
Take a look at the stars in your head, fields of space kid
[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Psychic changes are born in your heart,
entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
, bless your heart, girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song, I am with you
[Chorus]
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
Christ, I'm a sidewinder, I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere, oh, it's everything
