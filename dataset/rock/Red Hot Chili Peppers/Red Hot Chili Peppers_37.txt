[Verse 1]
There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I don't care, you see, so what if I bleed?
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real
[Verse 2]
A mountain never seemed to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real
[Chorus]
I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
But now she gone, yeah, she gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see, she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared
[Chorus]
I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
I showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
[Outro]
Fucked up
