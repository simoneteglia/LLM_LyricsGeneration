[Verse 1]
I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm, make you wanna resume
Now we know it all for sure
[Verse 2]
I'm a dance hall, dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you want to go
[Guitar Solo 1]
[Verse 3]
I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way
[Verse 4]
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you want to go
[Chorus]
(So)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
Come again, get me excited
[Guitar Solo 2]
[Verse 5]
I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure
[Verse 6]
I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
[Chorus]
(So)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
Come again, make me excited
(Oh-oh)
(Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)
(Sideways fallin')
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
(More will be revealed, my friend)
There's a match, now let me light it
[Guitar Solo 3]
[Verse 7]
I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Comin' down and more are comin' to believe
Now we know it all for sure
[Verse 8]
Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
[Outro]
I'll be there but tell me when you wanna go
Come again and tell me when you wanna go
More will be revealed, my friend
