[Verse 1]
I met a man in a rock 'n' roll band, he said, "Won't you come with me?"
I let him know that I could not go, you see, I get mine for free
[Chorus]
We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite
[Verse 2]
Step inside the emotional ride, I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary; I call my best friend Flea
[Chorus]
This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown between us, there are lines
[Bridge]
Yes, I told her that I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day? I would not have it any other way, well
Means so much to me. Can you see the we?
What are we ever gonna do when all I wanna be is next to you?
[Verse 3]
I took a girl from the underworld, and I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done, she was not up for the fight
[Chorus]
We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind
[Bridge]
It's my favorite, so I savor it
I must report that life is short, so of your love I'll take ten quarts, well
There's no end to this, don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and
Am I crazy to join the lazy zoo?
All these human butterflies and cactus flowers, swollen eyes, and
I want the devil's share of you, I do declare
Again, I'm asking, can I do when all these animals want
To be just like you
[Verse 4]
I met a girl with long, black hair, and she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil, and I picked her for my bride
[Chorus]
We are all just soldiers in this epic, loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right
[Outro]
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
