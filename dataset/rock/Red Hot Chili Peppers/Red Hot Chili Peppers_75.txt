[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Golden light
Streamin' from your eyes
Give me a piece of the real thing
And I live with you this life
Stripped and clean
A restless wolverine
An eloquent part of the whole dance
And I stray
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
with John Frusciante
]
Tell the whole world to slow down
We gotta get off and we gotta go 'round
Tell the whole world to roll down
The window is broken, forever unspoken
Only whenever
[Chorus: John Frusciante]
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for evеrything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantriеs
The memory
A chemistry
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Death to rise
Subtraction of advice
The criminal ties of my rival
And I'll roll these dice
Cold supply
Scraping to get by
Blatantly flooding the low rise
And I'll throw this knife
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis,
with John Frusciante
]
Trace me now through your innocence
Tell me it's part of the program I started
Space me now through your citizens
Tell me it's part of the whole plan now
Bringing my slow hand
[Chorus: John Frusciante]
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
A chemistry
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus: John Frusciante]
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
A chemistry
