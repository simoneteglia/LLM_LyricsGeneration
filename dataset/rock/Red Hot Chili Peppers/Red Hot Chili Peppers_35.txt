[Intro: John Frusciante]
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Waking up dead, inside of my head
Would never, never do, there is no med
No medicine to take
I've had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
It’s so bad, it’s got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away?
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
I knew a girl, she worked in a store
She knew not what her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her she would never be
As happy as a girl in a magazine
She bought it with her pay
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
Everyone has so much to say
They talk, talk, talk their lives away
Don’t even hesitate
Walkin' on down to the burial ground
It’s a very old dance with a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Slow cheetah, come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah, come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
[Instrumental Outro]
