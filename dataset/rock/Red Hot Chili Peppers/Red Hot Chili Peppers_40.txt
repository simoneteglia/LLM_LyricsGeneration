[Verse 1]
I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still, I so admired
[Verse 2]
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she-wolf style
Rip right through me
[Pre-Chorus]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feelin' is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
[Chorus]
(Ooh) Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
(Ooh-ooh) Give it up and I got what I came for
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ooh) Take it back and you make me nervous
(Ooh-ooh) Nothing better than love and service
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ahhh) Win in the long run
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
[Chorus]
(Ooh) Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for
(Ooh-ooh) Give it up and I got what I came for
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ooh) Take it back and you make me nervous
(Ooh-ooh) Nothing better than love and service
(Ooh-ooh) Universally speaking, I...
(Ahhh) Win in the long run
[Bridge]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feelin' is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Let's go
[Instrumental Outro]
