[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonnaâ€”?"
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
[Bridge: John Frusciante]
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say
[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis]
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace (Do svidaniya)
Simultaneous release (California)
California, show your teeth (Do svidaniya)
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
[Guitar Solo Outro: John Frusciante]
