[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
(Huh)
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
All aboard, stitch in time
Get yours, got mine
In a minute, I'll be there
Sit tight, get square
(Tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic)
You can do it at the hippodrome
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)
Slide back, trombone
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
Anybody got a TV at home?
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)
That's right, unknown
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman, save me some
Better get up on your run
(Huh)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
So much more than—
Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and—
And
Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And
Charlie's makin' me—
And
Charlie's makin' me smile
Oh, whoa, now
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
(Tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic)
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Everybody do the twist
Get the message on Flea's fists
Move around like a scientist
Lay down, get kissed
(Tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic)
Big picture and it never lies
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)
Big daddy will advise
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
EverReady in disguise
(One, one, one, one, one, one more)
Sunset, sunrise
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman, save me some
Better get up on your run
(Huh)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
So much more than—
Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and—
And
Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And
Charlie's makin' me—
And
Charlie's makin' me smile
Oh, whoa, now
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
My heart
, your skin
This love, I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong
Be free, belong
Intimate sight has come into light
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman, save me some
Better get up on your run
All I ever wanted to was pick it up and run with you
Slip it into a summer spell, double up and run like hell
(Huh)
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
So much more than—
Charlie's wakin' me
To my core and—
And
Charlie's shakin' me
And tell my story
And
Charlie's makin' me—
And
Charlie's makin' me smile
No, whoa, now
[Post-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis
with John Frusciante
]
My heart, your skin
This love
, I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong
Be free, belong
Intimate sight has come into light
My heart, your skin
This love, I'm in
We don't arrive without a surprise
You're right, I'm wrong
Be free, belong
Intimate sight has come into light
[Instrumental Outro]
