[Verse 1]
I like to stick to walls
Observing conversations, lifting them when they fall
I am a fire escape
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint
[Bridge - Chorus]
Save yourself, save yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
[Verse 2]
I see the seasons change
All the young faces come and replace the dying ones
Sit out on Lexington and Vine
All the pimps and prostitutes wave you down at stopping signs
[Chorus]
Save yourself, save yourself, yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
[Verse 3]
Los Angeles, I've been waiting for you
To pick yourself up and change
The city you've made on this ocean of sand
Was founded on liars and self-made men
[Outro]
I've watched the dreamers find their legs
And I've seen the ones that come get reduced to bones and rags
'Cause I am a fire escape
My spine is made of iron, my heart pumps out old red paint
Save yourself, save yourself
(Save yourself) Save yourself, save yourself
