Rise above, gonna start the war
Oh, what you want? What you need? What'd you come here for?
Well, an eye for an eye and an 'F' for fight
They're taking me down as the prisoners riot
Eh, yeah
Sometimes I want to disappear
Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear
Eh, oh, eh
Disappear
Disappear

When I feel kinda bad and don't want to stress
I just pass it off on ability
Well, you got what you want and what you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes I want to disappear
Disappear

(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What could come when we realize
I don't want to compromise
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, I'm scared but I'll disappear
Running around before it corners you
Like he's someone who lost his way
(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you want me
'Cause it's simple to see of my ability
(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah, you're undecided
Hey, it's the right feeling
Yeah, I don't wanna run away
You gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
Gotta focus on to your ability
Focus on to your ability
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Then they can't get what they want to steal
Can't get what they want to steal
Sometimes I want to disappear
Disappear

Disappear
Disappear
I want to disappear
