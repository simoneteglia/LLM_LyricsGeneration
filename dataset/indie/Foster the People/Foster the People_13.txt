[Chorus 1]
Just close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money
[Verse 1]
Is it wrong to write the rules?
We gotta strike a match and light the fuse
And now I'm never looking back
It's time to leave the future in the past
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I said it doesn't matter where I go, I am
Calling all the poets into battle, I am
Shouting to the world, let 'em know that we won't
Be afraid to step into the fight when we can't see the light
[Chorus]
So close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money
[Verse 2]
Well, if you're down, then soldier up
You better learn to shoot or learn to duck
There's no retreat and no escape
If we keep dreaming while we're wide awake
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I said it doesn't matter where I go, I am
Calling all the prophets into battle, I am
Never gonna change who I am, I won't
Bend under the pressure when my back's on the ropes
I said, it doesn't matter where I go, I am
Staring down the barrel of a gun, we are
Shouting to the world, let them know that we are
Not afraid to step into the fight when you can't see the light
[Chorus]
So close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money
[Bridge]
Well, it's a silicon rush
And I'm addicted
I don't understand
When it starts, I can't switch
Saying what I won't do
Well, pleasure comes as pain too
But mostly it's an afterthought
And it's slowly coming after you
[Chorus]
So close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money
