[Intro]
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see
[Drop]
I can see
[Bridge]
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
[Verse 1]
You got me frozen like a photograph, yeah
Floating in a future modern throwback, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
It's clearer than it was before
You can hide, you can hide, you can hide
But you don't see what I do
[Chorus]
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see
[Drop]
I can see
[Outro]
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
