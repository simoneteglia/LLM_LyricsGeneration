[Verse 1]
Come numb, come dumb, come young, come rain, come sun, come sunken-eyed and half-aware
Just point the magnet at me, man, let's get some money, we can make it fair
I could be the call to change your life
'Cause you've been on the run since ninety-five, you're nobody's favourite
[Chorus]
You're nobody's favourite one, you're nobody's favourite
You're nobody's favourite one, you're nobody's favourite
[Post-Chorus]
You're nobody's favourite one, you're nobody's favourite one
[Verse 2]
Say something cool, say something cool to keep it textual
Well, that's a mood, so, what's the move? She's standing next to you
Holy water, holy water or a shot of ginger ale
I've been drinking from wishing wells hoping it'll change my lot (It's not)
[Chorus]
You're nobody's favourite one, you're nobody's favourite
You're nobody's favourite one, you're nobody's favourite
[Post-Chorus]
You're nobody's favourite one, you're nobody's favourite one
