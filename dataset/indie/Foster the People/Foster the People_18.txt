[Verse 1]
I woke up on Champs-Élysées to the Djembe of Ghana
Yeah, a fine lady from Belize said "You got the spirit of Fela"
Yeah, the young one dripping make-up
lift her hands up to holla
Well, I gave her what I got but couldn't handle her broken heart
The right words in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Yeah, will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
Yeah, well, I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
But even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah
[Chorus]
With all these things I wait for revelation
These things make me want to duck for cover
With all these things I wait for revolution
These things ask the biggest question to me
And it's "are you what you want to be?"
Well, are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
The war machine will put out both its hands for a dollar
It's drinking at the table with the chrome hand guerrillas
And the young one dripping make-up lift her leg up to holla
Well, I told her what she's got should be protected in the arms of love
The right things in the hands of dissidents with the fire
Yeah, will rip apart the marrow from the bone of the liars
And, well, I'm afraid of saying too much and ending a martyr
But even more so I'm afraid to face God and say I was a coward, yeah
[Chorus]
With all these things I wait for revelation
These things make me want to duck for cover
With all these things I wait for revolution
These things ask the biggest question to me
And it's "are you what you want to be?"
Well, are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
So are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you what you want to be?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
