[Verse 1]
I wouldn't try to throw myself away
If you asked me, I'd say
To be careful, my love
At death we'll leave the same
If you want me to stay
Don't keep me waiting for it
[Pre-Chorus]
We can't change the things we can't control
It's summer somewhere so you shouldn't be so cold
But you can't even look me in the eye if you tried
We can try, we can try
[Chorus]
I see us dancing by ourselves
We do it better with no one around, yeah
Just you in my imagination, yeah
In my imagination, oh
[Verse 2]
Yeah, there's nothing left to cry about
I guess I'm living in a drought
It's raining like it was before
Something that you never knew you needed more of
[Pre-Chorus]
We can't change the things we can't control
It's summer somewhere so you shouldn't be so cold
But you can't even look me in the eye if you tried
We can try, we can try
[Chorus]
I see us dancing by ourselves
We do it better with no one around, yeah
Just you in my imagination, yeah
In my imagination, oh
[Bridge]
Just use your imagination, oh
Just use your imagination, oh
[Chorus]
I see us dancing by ourselves
We do it better with no one around, yeah
Just you in my imagination, yeah
In my imagination, oh
[Outro]
I can do so many things
So many things, so many things
You know if you just use your imagination
Oh, if you just use your imagination, oh
I really love you
