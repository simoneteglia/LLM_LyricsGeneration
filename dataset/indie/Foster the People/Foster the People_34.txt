[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I've broken every law
All the words come out my broken jaw
I don't know anything
But then I act like I know everything
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna talk about it
What do you see when you dream about it?
Well, I have been broke down from my enemies
I'm drifting farther from my memories
And then you take it away
[Chorus]
Every day, I'm fighting 'cause I can't leave it
Then I feel the weight and then I come back down
I watch from the sides and try to reach out
Just a little bit closer and then I come back down
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
You tell me what's my name
I'm the same, I've just been rearranged
Smile through a choke inside
Yeah, I've been hiding with nothing to hide
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna talk about it
What do you see when you dream about it?
Well, I have been broke down from my enemies
Just holding a piece of what's been left of me
And then you take it away
[Chorus]
Every day, I'm fighting 'cause I can't leave it
And then I feel the weight and then I come back down
I watch from the sides and try to reach out
Just a little bit closer and then I come back down
Yeah, you're pushing me, pushing me, I can feel it
Just a little bit higher and then I come back down
I'm climbing on people 'cause I've been blinded
And I'm waiting, I'm waiting around
[Interlude]
Sometimes, you find yourself waiting
Waiting for someone to come around
And it's hopeless, hoping to be found
Then it arrives and says, "You're perfect, my love"
And I, I know why
I know why, I know why
[Bridge]
But you said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know, you don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
You said, "I don't know"
[Outro]
Just take it away, yeah
What you find and heal my broken jaw, yeah
I am here and I've slain my hero, yeah, yeah
What you need is higher than your shame
