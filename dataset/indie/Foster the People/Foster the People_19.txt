[Verse 1]
I can't blame you, and I can't save you
But I will try
For you and I, for you and I
I won't find out all the dirty little things that you've done
But I will try
I, I
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm coming for you giants and you liars
and your chariots of fire
You charmers with your anecdotes have started to show your true colors
[Chorus]
And now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
Been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink
or are you waiting to drown?
[Verse 2]
I would break you before I let you fall into the blind
For you and I, for you and I
I will breathe in all the truth I can stomach
If it keeps you alive
I, I
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We've changed the dreamers and the preachers and the wise men on the hill
To concrete stepping smilers terrified to lose their power and control
Yeah, we've been crying for a leader to speak like the old prophets
The blood of the forgotten wasn't spilled without a purpose, or was it?
[Chorus]
And now I'm staring at the moon wondering why the bottom fell out
Been searching for answers and there's questions I've found
Open your eyes and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink
or are you waiting to drown?
[Outro]
Yeah, you'll never be whole, yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And think freely to smash the wall of apathy
Stop your self-importance and lift the weight off somebody else
Yeah, you'll never be whole, yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And stop drinking the wine that's been dripping
From lips of the gluttons and envying their bloody teeth
Yeah, you'll never be whole, yeah, you'll never be whole
Until you lose control
