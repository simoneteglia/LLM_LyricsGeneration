[Verse 1]
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
Never yours but someone else's voice
[Verse 2]
Slipping your body through the street
Sending your girlfriends to the night for cheap
Wearing a jacket made of meat
Sending a letter with war so sweet
[Hook 1]
And now you've see that
Waves turn to gray
Life in the shade
A violent cloud
That's on USA
Platinum's on the rise
Windows in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb, yeah
[Verse 3]
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
Never yours but someone else's voice
[Hook 2]
And now you see that
Waves turn to gray
Life in the shade
A violent cloud
That's on USA
Porn on the rise
Circles in disguise
I'm just tryin' to find
A mountain I can climb, yeah
[Outro]
Putting your patience to the test
Putting your body on the line, for less
Didn't you know there was a choice?
Never yours but someone else's voice
