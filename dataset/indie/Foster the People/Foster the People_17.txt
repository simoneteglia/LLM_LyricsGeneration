[Verse 1]
Walk, little walk, small talk, big thoughts
Gonna tell 'em all just what I want
That street, two streets, I see you and me
Hanging on the empty swings
Count high, low, don't worry, my eyes are closed
I'm a superman and it's my show
One shoe, two, gonna kick with my new shoes
I'm gonna kick until I need new shoes
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
[Post-Chorus]
(
These are one of those times when we're gonna have a lot of fun
)
[Verse 2]
I run, they run, everybody run, run
And we're all just having fun
Sleigh ride, boat ride, piggyback ride
I'm gonna show 'em all how I can ride
One, two, three, close your eyes and count to four
I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door
Crayons on walls, I'll color on them all
I'll draw until I've broken every law
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
[Bridge]
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
[Chorus]
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
Stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
Stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it
I said, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop with me
