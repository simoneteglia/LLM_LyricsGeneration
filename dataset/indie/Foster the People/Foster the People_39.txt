[Verse 1]
Under the moon, I cry
Waiting in the whisper of your name, my lullaby
And I'm caught here in your eye
I cannot be afraid to let you love me when we're far away
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We'll figure it out, we'll figure it out
I'll pretend that you are sleeping next to me
[Chorus]
Are you lookin' out your window?
Are you lookin' out your window?
[Verse 2]
I wanna see your smile
And I'd do anything just to see it now
[Bridge 1]
Pull the light in through your window
Know that I am doing the same
Close your eyes and sink through your pillow
We'll see each other in our dreams
[Verse 3]
Into the night, I say your name
Wish upon the headlights of the cars that are flickering
And I'll wait here 'til the light
Sing the lullaby I've been singing to myself at night
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, calm down, we'll figure it out
Just pretend that I am sleeping next to you
[Chorus]
Are you lookin' out your window?
Are you lookin' out your window?
[Post-Chorus]
It's me there
Oh, it's me
In the fear that we share
[Bridge 2]
Your heart is my home
Our love will keep us warm
Your heart's made of gold
Mine is silver like the moon
Pull the light into your shadow
Know that I am doing the same
Close your eyes and sink through your pillow
Know that I am singing your name
[Outro]
Can you see?
Can you see?
See the moon tonight?
We're looking at the same sky
Yeah, we're looking at the same sky
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see the moon tonight?
Yeah, we're looking at the same sky
Oh, we're looking at the same sky
