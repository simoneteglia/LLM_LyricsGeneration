[Verse 1]
Well, I've tried to live like the way that you wanted me to
Never needed the proof, just followed the rules
Well, I pick up all the paces and move my feet as fast as I can
I'm always falling behind, just float in the lines
And you want more and ambition's taken its toll on you
Well, hey, your confidence is fading with your youth
[Chorus]
If you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Well, I've found the more I want, the less I've got
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
[Verse 2]
You're coughing blood again
I know 'cause I clean up the mess every now and then
Just fold the line along the seam
Force a smile and never say what you mean
You're in the promised land in someone else's dream
If you want more and you'll get there
,
Throw a quarter in the well
It's okay, you're fine, ambition's not a crime
[Chorus]
If you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Well, I've found the more I want, the less I've got
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well, ask yourself
[Bridge]
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well, ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well, ask yourself
[Outro]
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well, ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?
Well, ask yourself
