[Verse 1]
Hello, my name is Mark, I play gentlemen's games
Yeah, I just slip through, I'm creepin' through the night's parade
I shake a hand or two, I tip my hat to you
I'm always runnin' and a-jumpin' like a fool would do
Until, wow, I see her, she sees me, we could be
Something, it's excitin', want to run away
But I don't move, I stay, I talk to her and say
Y-y-y-you were meant for me, oh, I can't speak
I think I'm falling in love
[Chorus]
Love, love, love
It can be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It can make you crazy
[Verse 2]
Sarah, she's a cougar,
got moves like barracudas
On the hunt for the runts that look under twenty-two years
Got her head up high, high heels that match her thighs
Yeah, she be spending lots of money, her friends think she's real funny
She says, "Hey, look at me, you will see that I'm a queen
Got experience to give, all the life you never lived"
But all the boys just run, she never has her fun
Oh yeah, but Sarah
, she don't care, she keeps looking
'Cause she's hopeful for love
[Chorus]
Love, love, love
It can be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It can make you crazy
Love, love, love
It can be an incredible thing
Love, love
And if you have it, it's amazing
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
Ooh
Yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
I got the fever, got the fever, got the fever, I said
She's got the fever, got the fever, yeah, I'm falling in love
He's got the fever, got the fever, got the fever, I see it
They've got the fever, got the fever, yeah, we're falling in love
[Chorus]
Love, love, love
It can be a wonderful thing
Love, love
It can make you crazy
Love, love, love
It can be an incredible thing
Love, love
And if you have it, it's amazing, yeah
