[Verse 1]
Parading to the masses, we're coming so fresh to death
I've been stealing looks from shadows, you conjure with your purse
Yeah, you're walking in stilettos but your nose is bleeding out
I've been running from the devil but the devil's on my back
I'm decreasing, took a leave of absence from the war
If the wall is coming down, then we got to press the pedal
Got my hands up in the air, I'm saying I can't breathe
I got my hands up in the air, I'm saying
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man, get away from me
Yeah
Hey man, get away from me
Uh
Yeah, oh
[Chorus]
Never ask for any favors, there's nothing I want from you
I've been looking for an answer to keep me from fallin' through
And I'm waiting for the voice to speak 'cause I can't see
I hope we'll hear the sound eventually
[Verse 2]
I felt their claws obstruct and refuse refugees in the new Rome
Lock our voices in the oven like S-Sylvia at home
My eyes are on the world
Yeah, my hands anxious to feel something real
True colors tend to glisten and then reveal
[Interlude]
Where's the love?
Mmm
And
why are we so far from love?
[Verse 3]
Chased by badges, duckin' lights, push the dagger when it's right
Martial law
,
inshallah
,
mi casa es tuya
Ghosting like I'm Daniel Johnston
and I'm locked up in the basement
Where Satan lies in satin tweets and
realigns his face lift
The criminals are laughing with their empty, toothless faces
We've melted all our gold to recommence our idol worship
We all pretend one day we'll be the greatest of the Gatsbys
Growling mouths with rabies and loyal like Sid and Nancy
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey man, get away from me
You pretend you got control
Hey man, get away from me
[Chorus]
Never ask for any favors, there's nothing I want from you
I've been praying for an answer to keep me from fallin' through
Yeah
Yeah, I'm waiting for the voice to speak 'cause I can't see
Oh, we'll hear the sound eventually, yeah
We'll hear the sound, we'll hear the sound eventually
