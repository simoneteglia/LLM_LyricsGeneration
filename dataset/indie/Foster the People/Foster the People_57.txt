[Verse 1]
When you're all alone and you're thinking about everything
Know that wherever I am, that I'm doing the same
[Chorus]
Across the ocean of a thousand miles
It doesn't mean we can't talk a while and smile (At each other)
'Cause we're only human
It's okay to be human
[Verse 2]
We're stronger when we say we don't know the way
The courage that it takes to keep on searching is a beautiful thing
No use in pointing the blame, yeah, we're in this together
[Chorus]
Across the ocean, looking up at the stars
There's something out there that lets us know
It's okay (To be human)
It's okay to be human (We're only human)
We're only human (We're only human)
We'll get through this together
[Outro]
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, my love
Won't give up, won't give up, won't give up, won't give up on you
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, my love
'Cause we're together, at least we're together
