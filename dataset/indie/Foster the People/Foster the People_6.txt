[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
Yeah, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
[Verse 1]
Feelings sleeping in the field again
But I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well, I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc
[Pre-Chorus]
It dries up
I've been a spoken word, I've been a riverbed
I've been a rabid force
and let it flow out from within
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh
[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
[Verse 2]
Waves in theta slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel the celestial beings
Wilted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see the beauty in the mess
[Pre-Chorus]
It dries up
I've been a riverbed, I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can,
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes I feel like I only dream in black and white
And color's so, oh
[Chorus]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You do everything you can 'cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside down)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
[Bridge]
I am here
No matter where you are
I'm waiting here with open arms
No matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait until it passes by
Like a satellite or star
No matter where you are
[Outro]
(When your best friend's all strung out)
You know it, ooh, ooh
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Oh yeah, you know it, ooh, ooh
(When your best friend's all strung out)
Oh yeah, you know it
You oughta know that I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside down)
Oh yeah, you know it
That's how you know that your best friend's all strung out
