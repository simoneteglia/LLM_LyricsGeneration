[Verse 1]
Yeah it’s over, it’s over
I’m circling these vultures
Got me praying, man this hunger
Feeling something rotten
Feeling kinda tempted
And I’m pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers
‘Cause now all I want is you
I'm sayin’
[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high
[Verse 2]
Well I ain’t frontin' my intention
Got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention
Got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you said you wanna keep it light
But I’m here to tell you
I’m not trying to change your mind
It’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, oooh
[Chorus]
Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
And I’ll take you high
[Bridge]
It's alright
It's alright
Yeah, It's alright
[Chorus]
So come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I’ll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me
[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
