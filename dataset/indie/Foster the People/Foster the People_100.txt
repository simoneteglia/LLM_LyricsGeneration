[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I'll hold your hand when you are feeling mad at me
Yeah, when the monsters, they won't go, and your windows don't close
I'll pretend to see what you see
How long, I say, how long
Will you relive the things that are gone?
Oh yeah, the devil's on your back, but I know you can shake him off
Mmm
[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you
[Verse 2]
You know it's funny how freedom can make us feel contained
Yeah, when the musclеs in our legs aren't used to all thе walking
Mmm
I know if you could snap both your fingers that you'd escape with me
But in the meantime, I'll just wait here and listen to you when you speak
Or scream
[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you
[Bridge]
The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
You can fight it off, you can fight it off, you can
[Chorus]
And every day that you want to waste
That you want to waste, you can
And every day that you want to wake up
And you want to wake, you can
And every day that you want to change
That you want to change, yeah
I'll help you see it through
'Cause I just really want to be with you
[Outro]
Don't fade away
You can fight for what you know is true
Don't fade away
I can do it, it's a [?] of faith
The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
You can fight for what you know is the truth
The truth cuts us and pulls us back up
And separates the things that look the same
But you can fight it off, don't fight it off but you can
