[Verse 1]
(Omnipotent, omnipotent)
You are a secret that's worth keeping
And now I'm keeping my mouth shut
On the weekends
I won't hang out with anybody else
The pavement, always begging
What's it want from me?
And I keep falling backwards, looking for relief
Oh, to be free
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, I've been counting all the minutes
And the days have been counting me
[Chorus]
I want to live my life again
But you are
I'll never understand the winds
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you did
I want to do it again
[Verse 2]
Well, I've been sleeping
Waiting for something
But to feel nothing
At all, and avoid the call
Sometimes I'm reckless
Sometimes misdirected
And sometimes when I'm tested
I tend to do nothing at all
[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I'm alone
There's a ghost that keeps talking
And I know there's gotta be more
For sure
[Chorus]
I want to live my life again
But you are
I'll never understand the winds
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you did
I want to do it again
[Bridge]
(Omnipotent, omnipotent)
Yeah, mmm
I've been numbing my thoughts for hours
Well, I know you wanted to save me from myself
We've been wilting our young for seed
And I can't compete
We're too strong to feel
What's real
[Chorus]
I want to live my life again
But you are
I'll never understand the winds
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you did
I want to do it again
[Outro]
Yeah, do you want to live forever?
Mmm, ah, mmm
