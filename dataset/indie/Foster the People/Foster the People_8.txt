[Intro]
What you need? What you need?
What you need, man? What you need?
What you need? Yeah, what'd you see?
What'd you see? Yeah, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
Well, I need a little something to cool my head off
Need a little something to cool my head off, yeah
Need a little something because I've been running from a truce
We'll never lose
Lies come from loose teeth tied to the noose
Climbing up my own tree hoping it can hold
All the things I've seen but have chosen to ignore, mmm
Well, I said, well, I believe I've been well fed, yeah
But the wolf's not dead
[Chorus]
Say what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day
like night
We're here to fight, we all go wild again
And you have the name of someone I love
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm
[Verse 2]
Pay the man, pay the man
Got to pay the man, run as fast as you can
Call out to God, praise to the Most High
Call out for help 'cause I'm playing with fire
Call out on mountains till my voice goes faint
Echoes through time then comes back with new strength
[Interlude]
And when it's raining, we're sailing
Oh yeah, we're sailing, we're sailing
[Verse 3]
I'm off the leash,
I go to war for peace
'Cause I've been touching everything that I can
I got blood on my hands
Guess I'm going deaf from what the crowd is sayin'
Ah, please forgive me, I don't understand
We all believe we've been well fed, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
The deaf man heard what the mute man said
Then they all followed where the blind man led
[Chorus]
Say what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day
like night
We're here to fight, we all go wild again
And you have the name of someone I love
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm
[Bridge]
(Pay the man, pay the man, pay the man)
Pay the man, you got to pay the man
Pay the man, you got to pay the man, pay the man
Well, I was laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
I was laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Need a little something, yeah, need a little something
(Little something, little something, little something)
(Little something, little something, little something, little)
[Chorus]
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm
[Outro]
Can't you see? Can't see me
Can't see me, can't see me
Yeah, can't see me, can't see me
We all run when the light comes on
Am I wrong for wanting it all?
But I warned you, mmm
