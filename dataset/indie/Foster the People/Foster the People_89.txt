[Verse 1]
It's hard to look into your eyes
Knowing it might be the last time
The spaces in between our breaths
They’re singing to the infinite
[Chorus]
When I'm quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that’s all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same
[Verse 2]
The silence is a lonely thing
Waiting for a sound to fall
A lullaby to calm our sleep
The promise of another world
[Pre-Chorus]
Sudden changеs make the air uncomfortable
I'll hold you so you’rе not alone, no
[Chorus]
When I’m quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that’s all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I’m so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same
[Bridge]
(So in love with loving you)
[Chorus]
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same
