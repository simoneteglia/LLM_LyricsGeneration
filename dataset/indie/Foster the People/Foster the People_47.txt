[Verse 1]
Access granted, you can misbehave
Throw away your constraints
Say my name with no regrets
Yeah, you never have to take it back
Saying, "I don't wanna run around"
"Yeah, I'm carrying our only child"
Well, the static blowing through your hair
The signal's crossed but it's clear
I can make it out
[Chorus]
All alone
All the things that we do when we're left on our own
And all the things that we just love to hide
All alone
All the things that we do when no one's around
We're just playing in the underground
[Verse 2]
You throw up a prayer, then you move to another god
You throw up a prayer, then you move to another god
It seems you're not the only one
Who gives away your voice
Yeah, well, I've given up all control
No, we don't have to save the world
I don't need to understand
The way things spin around
Yeah, well, I'll never know
[Chorus]
All alone
All the things that we do when we're left on our own
And all the things that we just love to hide
All alone
All the things that we do when no one's around
We're just playing in the underground
[Bridge]
We cross lines for love
Some make it out
And some never make it out
[Outro]
I am, you are, you will or you won't
Come with me
Just play in the underground
We just play in the underground
Yeah, and we can play in the underground
When we're all alone
There's things that I want to do with you
Where we can play, we can play
We can play, we can play in the underground
