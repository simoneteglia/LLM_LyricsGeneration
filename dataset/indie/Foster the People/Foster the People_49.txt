I ate it all
Plastic diamonds
and
sugar coated arsenic
We danced in honey and sea salt sprinkled laxative
Coral blossomed portraits in
Rembrandt light
Cheekbones high and fashionable
Snap! goes the moment
A photograph is time travel
Like the light of dead stars
painting us with their warm titanic blood
Parasitic kaleidoscopes
and psychotropic glow worms
stop me in my tracks
Aphids sucking the red off a rose
But for beauty I will gladly feed my life
In the mouths of rainbows
Their technicolor teeth cutting prisms and smiling benevolently
On the pallid hue of the
Working class hero
