[Verse 1]
Wouldn't it be nice if we just laid in bed
All day in our desires?
The world can make its pretty noise
While you and me can play in here together
[Chorus]
Mmm, every day I wake up from a dream
Into another dream
That dream is you
Oh, you
[Verse 2]
Wouldn't it be nice to hold each other
When we're older and remember?
(These days)
To look into each other's eyes
And see our younger selves look back with laughter
(At these days)
[Chorus]
Mmm, every day I wake up from a dream
The sound of your breathing
The sound of my love
It's you
[Bridge]
Your heart is my only home
I'll never be alone when it's near me
Be near me, come closer
Closer, just be with me
[Instrumental Outro]
