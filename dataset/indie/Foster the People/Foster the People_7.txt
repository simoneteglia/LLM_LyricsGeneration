[Verse 1]
Never want to stand upon myself
Never want to get in the way, I said it
I don't know what the plan is, but you can share with me
'Cause I'll be a listening ear
To everything you say, I won't turn away
And I'll listen, open up my heart and
I must say that I love you, so
[Chorus]
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known
[Verse 2]
Every day is a battle I face
Strange life I live, but it's what you've decided
I give it all into your hands
Do what you will with me
And I'll, I'll smile when you speak
Remember all those times I was hoping for something?
And shaking my head from all I had done
But you never left me
[Chorus]
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known
[Bridge]
Give it up for you, I would give it up for you
I would give it up for you, I'd do anything for you
[Chorus]
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than ever before
Ooh-la-love, I've fallen in love
And it's better this time than I've ever known
[Outro]
I have fallen in love
I have fallen in love
