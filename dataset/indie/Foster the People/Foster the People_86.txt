Be

Friend's all strung out
Be
Be
Best
When your best friend's all strung out
Be
Best
Friend's all strung out
Best friend's all strung
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
When you're hanging upside down
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
(When your)
The trust is that it might affect you for the rest of your life
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
(Best friend's all strung out)
(Best friend's all strung out)
(Best friend's all strung, strung)
With your feet up in the clouds
And your head's hanging upside-down
When your best friend's all strung out
And you find it all around
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
And your head's hanging upside down
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
