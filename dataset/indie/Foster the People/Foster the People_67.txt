[Verse 1]
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life
Try to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know, the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
[Chorus]
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (Have you еver been down?)
[Post-Chorus]
(Have you evеr been down?)
[Verse 2]
Well, I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
[Chorus 2]
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no (Have you ever been down?)
[Post-Chorus]
(Have you ever been down?)
[Verse 3]
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, that's life
Try to make ends meet, try to find somebody, then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know, the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah
[Outro]
It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
It's just sex and violence, melody and silence
