[Verse 1]
If age is a trap
I wonder why I hold back
(Mistakes)
A mistake to make me laugh
Only time can answer that
[Chorus 1]
Saól Aláin
Beautiful is your life
Saól Aláin
I want to live in your love forever
[Verse 2]
I'm done, I'm giving up control
So hold on, never let me go
I know we're not invincible
So I want to live, live for something more
[Chorus 2]
Saól Aláin
Beautiful is your life
Soak it in
I want to live in your love forever
[Bridge]
And I won't be afraid, it's true we'll never know
When the night will come and take us home
And people change, we fade from youth
And evolve into eternal life
Don't slip away, well, I'm begging you
To let me sing with angels
[Outro]
Wake the sleeping from their dreaming
We all want more, we all want more
Saints will sing and hearts are beating
Saying we all want more, we all want more
