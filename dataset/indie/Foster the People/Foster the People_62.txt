[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
Well, oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
[Verse 1]
Feelings, sleeping in the field again
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It dries up
I've been a smoking word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
And let it flow out from within
The trust is that it might affect you for the rest of your life
Yeah, you can control the one, you give, it takes a life
You gotta sleep in your bed, and hope the words will come again
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so oh
[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
Well, oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
[Verse 2]
Waits, and fed us slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, the celestial beings
Welted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see, the beauty in the mask
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It draws up
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt my wound
I carried more than I can
I feel I got a lot to prove
The trust is that it might affect you for the rest of your life
Yeah, you can control the one, what you got's what you got
You gotta sleep in your bed, and hope the words will come again
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so oh
[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
When you're hanging upside down
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start
[Bridge]
I'm here
No matter where you are
I'm waiting here
Open arms, no matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait
It passes by like a satellite, a star
No matter where you are
[Instrumental]
[Refrain]
When your best friend's all strung out
You know when
Oooooh
Oooooh
When your feel up in the clouds
Oh yeah, you know it
Oooooh
Oooooh
When your best friend's all strung out
Oh yeah, you know it
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
In your head, hanging upside-down
Yeah, you know it
That's how you know when your best friend's all strung out
