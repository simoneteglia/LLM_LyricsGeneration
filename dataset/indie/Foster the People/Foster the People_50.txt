[Verse 1]
I walk with a real big stick
You hear a whisper, I don't give no lip
Yeah, the bark comes before the bite
Changes nothing, I'm the only dog in the fight
And the rules, they don't always apply
'Cause people love when you're a hell of a guy
Yeah, I walk with a real big stick
Here's the situation, I'm coming tonight, oh
[Chorus]
Kiss me a little
Kiss me before you roar
I'm yours, forever yours
And you are mine to take tonight
[Verse 2]
Well, there's a growl there deep inside
It's purely animal and socially compatible
A rough exterior shine
Pushing on my principle, she's always unpredictable
Her hand held will do you right
Melting all the ice from your heart tonight
Yeah, I walk with a real big stick
No one's gonna hurt you, I'll never desert you
[Chorus]
Kiss me a little
Kiss me before you roar
I'm yours, forever yours
And you are mine to take tonight
Hey
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Yeah
Yeah, you know it's true
That it's true, that it's true
Yeah
[Outro]
That I walk with a real big stick
I back up on my promises, I promise I'm protagonist
A little bite'll do you good
I'll sink my teeth in like you knew I would
And together, we'll spark a fire
Starting wars over borders, giving birth to desire
And you walk with a sway in your hips
Be my queen, I'll show you a palace
