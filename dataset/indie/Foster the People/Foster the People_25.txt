[Verse 1]
Forget your problems
, lay it down, they start up
The innocence of what you are is what I want
I've ran my colors
,
dripped down and drained out
Tried a million things, but my heart's been shot
I hope you try to find me,
I'm all spun and pacing
I know what you want to say here, so say it
Forget the words I'm speaking, just want to rearrange
So I'll just say it
[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Smile at the chance just to see you again
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Instrumental Post-Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Heat stroke, death's like
,
the wrong things that I think are right
I never knew that I could go as far as this
I took a problem recently forgotten
I know who I had been before I slipped
Oh, I want to change it,
I will live a life
That makes you smile when I'm done here and long gone
Feverish and peaking, just want to see your face
Oh, what you say? What you say?
[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Smile at the chance just to see you again
I really miss you, miss you, I said
Just look at me now
before I walk away
You just might miss me, miss me one day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Instrumental Outro]
