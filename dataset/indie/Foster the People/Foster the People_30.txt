[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi
[Verse 1]
Startin’ it up after dark
Chasin' thoughts, cruisin' through
Echo Park
Joined the vultures eatin’ paradise
Gettin' tilted, yeah, we'll pay the price (But ain't it nice?)
[Pre-Chorus]
Never say, "Goodbye", we say, "Hello"
Faded in the sunshine and the snow
[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi
[Break]
[Verse 2]
Skippin' lines and brushin' past the suits
Duckin' pictures and droppin’ some truths
Now I’m gettin' lost up in the Hills
But cruise the ’Gram and now I'm catchin' feels
Is this for real?
[Pre-Chorus]
Never say, "Goodbye", we say, "Hello"
Faded in the sunshine and the snow
[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi
[Break]
[Bridge]
Yeah, you know
It’s only in L.A
Yeah, uh huh
(
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
)
Only in L.A
(
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
)
[Chorus]
All my worst nights are the best times
West Coast stealin' all my shut-eye
All my worst nights are the good kind
High life filtered through the lo-fi
[Outro]
(
Lo-fi, lo-fi
)
Yeah, uh huh
Highs filtered through the low
You know, woo
High life filtered through the lo-fi
