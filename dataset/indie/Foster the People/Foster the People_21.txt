[Verse 1: Jena Malone]
A circuit likening, you glisten in bed
The static shifts, static shift of leather
One morning I did try to call him by his name
But my man didn't know when to come around
[Pre-Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
How long, how long will we try to make it together?
It's too long, it's too long, we could die just hanging here forever
Hold on, hold on, we'll get by as static space lovers
And we'll be fine circling each other
[Verse 2: Mark Foster]
We placed our bets, say "Praise the Lord"
Your static lips leave me wanting more
Well, don't float too far
'Cause I won't live without your constellation
Reach out, my love
'Cause I can't hold on forever
[Pre-Chorus 2: Mark Foster]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
But I'll try
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And we'll never have to say goodbye
[Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
How long, how long will we try to make it together?
It's too long, it's too long, we could die just hanging here forever
Hold on, hold on, we'll get by as static space lovers
And we'll be fine circling each other
[Bridge: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh
[Chorus: Mark Foster and Jena Malone]
It's too long, too long, we could die just hanging here forever
Hold on, hold on, and we'll get by as static space lovers
And we'll be fine circling each other
