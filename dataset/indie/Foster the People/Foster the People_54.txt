[Verse 1]
I just wanna take you for a ride up in my Cadillac
Let your hair go wild and put the seats back
I just wanna take you to a place where you've never been
Are you buckled in? 'Cause I don't hold back
[Chorus]
You've been lifted up, you've been lifted up
You've been lifted up on solid ground
Where we can be or not be found
And I've been lifted up to hold your crown
[Verse 2]
I just wanna take you for a ride through my dreams at night
Well, come and catch the fly and we can play with fire
[Bridge]
Wanna lift you higher
Come with me, my queen
I wanna go everywherе to lift your crown higher
Come with me, my queen
I wanna go with you еverywhere to lift your crown higher
You'll always be my queen
I wanna go with you everywhere and lift your crown
[Chorus]
You've been lifted up, you've been lifted up
You've been lifted up on solid ground
Where we can be or not be found
And I've been lifted up to hold your crown
[Outro]
I just wanna take you for a ride up in my Cadillac
Well, is that too much to ask?
We could make it last, oh
