[Intro]
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
And I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see
[Verse 1]
You got me frozen like a photograph, yeah
Floating in a future modern throwback, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
It's clearer than it was before
You can hide, you can hide, you can hide
But you don't see what I do
[Chorus]
I can see
And I can feel
I can see
And I can feel
[Verse 2]
Caught up drifting in your rainbow eyes, yeah
On the moon watching your sunrise, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, you're alive, we're alive
It's clearer than it was before
You can hide, you can hide, you can hide
I'll help you see what I do
[Chorus]
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
And I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
[Drop]
And I can feel
I can see
And I can feel
I can see
