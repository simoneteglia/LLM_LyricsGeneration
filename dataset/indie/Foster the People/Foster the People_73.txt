Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Sometimes life, it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head
Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show 'em what I choose, got nothing to lose, oh
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Hold on tight
