[Verse 1]
Well, I was caught inside the wreck
Never found my way out, I was filled with indifference
The animals, they were getting tired
So I sang them a song
'Cause they promised not to take too long
Well, I can't find my way back home
I'll listen to you if you want me to
But you have to share a smoke
Yeah, I've been running against the wind
And I can hear the angels calling
The madness has been pulling me right
Back out of my stride
I feel the change in the rising tide
Blood is in the room
I buried all my wrongs there with my youth
[Chorus]
(Don't give up on me now)
I'm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
And I'm falling apart
Whoo, yeah
[Verse 2]
Well, pleased to meet you, excuse my hands
I've been bitten by an enemy that's pretended to be my friend
No, I never wanted to be like them
I thought I was just too clever
To be brought down to their level
Of misfortuned chagrin
I don't care now what it's worth
But if you lift this burden off my back
I'll follow you to the bloody end
I've lived my life the way I want
But no one can tell me they're not afraid
Of the freedom of deliverance
Well, I take it all in stride
I feel the change in the rising tide
And someone's in the room
I buried all my guilt there with my youth
[Chorus]
(Don't give up on me now)
I'm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
And it's warm on the outside
(Don't give up on me now)
That's a lie
I don't want to fall apart
[Verse 3 - Outro]
Yeah, well, me? I've been afraid
I clawed and I fought like hell
The darkest days upon you
Yeah, well, me? I've gone astray
My blood was turning to sand
The darkest days upon you
Yeah, well, me? I've been afraid
The numbness was getting closer
The feverish days upon you
Yeah
Whoo
Whoo
Whoo
Whoo, ah
