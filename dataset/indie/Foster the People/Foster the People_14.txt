[Verse 1]
It's hard to look into your eyes
Knowing it might be the last time
The spaces in between our breaths
They're singing to the infinite
[Pre-Chorus]
Sudden changes make the air uncomfortable
I'll hold you so you're not alone
[Chorus]
When I'm quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same
[Verse 2]
The silence is a lonely thing
Waiting for a sound to fall
A lullaby to calm our sleep
The promise of another world
[Pre-Chorus]
Sudden changes make the air uncomfortable
Oh, hold me so I'm not alone, no
[Chorus]
When I'm quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same
[Bridge]
Float into the endless night
Dust cradles our names
And all the things we ever cared for
To run again without the pain
To love you without being afraid
To fall into the flowers bloom, of the other side
[Chorus]
When I'm quiet on the other side
Know that I'm loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
You're fine, my love, never mind 'cause I'm here
I keep laughing to myself
I'm so in love with loving you, that's all I do
Is keep loving you
Where things will change, but I'll always be the same
[Outro]
Oh, when I'm quiet on the other side
Yeah, I am loving you, that's all I do
And things will change, but you'll be alright
