[Verse 1]
We're born to die so I'm gonna fight for how I wanna live
Spark up the riots, I guess I'm a criminal and a futurist
With the charges I've caught won't stand your trial
You can take it out on me, yeah
I've been to hell but I've learned to keep my cool
Holdin' onto the devil, got him by the throat 'cause I refuse
Yeah, I won't take my last breath in denial
And you can't take it from me, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've seen peaks, been released into the prisons below
My days here disappear, there's things that I can't ignore
The sweetest release might take a while
[Chorus]
So take me out in style
Yeah, you
Yeah, just take me out in style, oh
If you're gonna take me out, take me out in style
[Verse 2]
We're in the lion's den, consumption is our medicine
And so I'm high again, you can say I'm a true American
Well, the sweetest revenge is being set free
You can't take it from me, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It begins at my end, my death will never survive
I've been cleared of my crimes, don't need no alibi
The sweetest release might take a while
[Chorus]
Just take me out in style
Yeah, you
Yeah, just take me out in style, ah
If you're gonna take me out, take me out, take me out in style
Yeah, you, yeah
Well, the sweetest release might take a while
Just take me out, take me out in style, woo
[Interlude]
(You'll never take me alive)
[Chorus]
Just take me out in style
(If you're gonna take me)
Take me in style
If you're gonna love me
Love me in style
The sweetest release might take a while
Take me out, take me out in style
[Outro]
If you're gonna fight me
Fight me in style
If you're gonna hate me
Hate me in style
If you're gonna love me
Do it in style
Yeah, just do it in style
