[Verse 1]
I can never be like you, I don't ever talk like that
You smile with a sparkler drink and stumble in your lipstick mess
Well, Hollywood philosophies, yeah, it's a tragedy
But you keep hanging on with a vacant look
Just waiting around for someone to take you home
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late, I didn't wanna come
[Chorus]
(Ah)
Oh no, man, it's just not that much fun
(Ooh)
[Verse 2]
Well, my eyes are wandering, can we just eat the news?
And dance around the room in our scattered point of views
Take my hand and breathe, yeah, just count to three
I wish that I could blink and turn all your words
Into ice cubes so I could fill my drink
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late, next time I just won't come
[Chorus]
Woo (Ah)
Oh man, well, I think I gotta run
(Ooh)
[Bridge]
Well, hey, what's that called
When you're sitting on your couch
And having fun just being by yourself?
Wondering why we can't commit to love
The things that we got we always want more of
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you'd rather have me fake it, but I'm not gonna make it
[Chorus]
Woo (Ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now I gotta run
(Ooh) Woo
