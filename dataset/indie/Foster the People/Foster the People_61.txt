[Verse 1]
Well let's take off from the start
I know you've tried all this before
And did your best to fight the war and break it off
But if I follow my name
I will calm you in the storm
And breathe you in when you are worn, be still my love
Would it take a shooting star?
To show you life could bloom when something breaks
And when the the pieces fall I'll catch them all
[Chorus]
Nevermind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face
Nevermind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I will be here smiling when I see your face
[Verse 2]
Yeah it's hard to know the truth
In this post-modernist view
Where absolutes are seen as relics
And laughed out of the room
And I'm scared to say your name
I've cried wolf so many times, cause I'm afraid of what you'd want from me
And will you find me through the grey?
My mind's a minefield of the wretched
It's honestly deceptive
[Chorus]
Nevermind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I'll be here smiling when I see your face
Nevermind what you're looking for
You're gonna find what you're looking for
Sometimes it's blinding in the race
But I will be here smiling when I see your face
[Bridge]
Aaaah...
Aaaah...
Aaaah...
Aaaah...
[Outro]
Nevermind what you're looking for
You'll always find what you're looking for
