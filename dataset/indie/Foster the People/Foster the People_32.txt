[Chorus]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time
[Verse 1]
I took the man and his horse and ran before he looked up
I said the light's gonna change
but I'm calm and feeling warm
Now I'm sticking out my hands
And feeling weightless again
You got to push, got to shove
Got to eat before they eat me
Got the crown and the cup
Got to write to my family
And say, "I'm calm and feeling warm"
I'm not quite there, but I'm close
And it's a world of a difference
[Chorus]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time
[Verse 2]
Got the worst all behind me
Yeah, they'll never be able to find me
I'm the king of the city
I'm a roach and they're all primates
This is meal time, real life
I'm not gonna fight
No, I'm gonna start a war
I've been right, I've been wrong
My smokes have come and gone
I've been crazy
,
been fed enough to not wind up dead
And I'm lonely
,
my eyes have been closed to the world
'Cause the world's got nothing for me
[Chorus]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
But I can't seem to catch a dime
Take a little hit and I lose the time
[Outro]
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
Yet again, I'm hustling, hustling, hustling
