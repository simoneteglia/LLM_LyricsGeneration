[Hook]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
[Verse 1]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, in the box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you
[Hook x2]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
[Rap]
Southside boy in the wild wild west
Came up a G so I while a best
Wanna test the waters you can be my guest
If you goin too deep imma lay you to rest
It's assinine
How I blast the nine
And the cast is tryin
And pacifyin
Rapper firin
Fo' blast the iron
Thrash the ass
Like fast is lyin'
So hear the roar when I come your way
With my game in hand but I ain't come to play
I got a job to do it's gettin' done today
If it ain't yo business then get out' my way
My gun is cold but my head is steamin'
You done me wrong it ain't have no reason
You changed the story like they change the season
Didn't think I'd show up and start the squeezin'
Nigga this is ready for the shit to get hot
I ain't leavin' this bitch just about to get shot
But it count just cause I'm in the resid[?] I got
Who've you try to live get the fuck about the lot
Man, it's about to get bad
Off in the upstrap
But finna bus gad
If you a tough catch
You better bus back
Or imma touch bags
So put the stars back
But thats enough of that
Shoot shit then they get killed
Try to act tough till they see the steel
The rubber pop off till they crack that seal
Pullers rotate like a kill eight wheel
Stone cold killer from the C.H.I
They fuck a Hollywood then you stay or die
So you hoes better really vacate the place
'Fore I straight hate and I AK your face

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
