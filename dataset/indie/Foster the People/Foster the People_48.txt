[Verse 1]
Hey, turn around, man, I'm gonna take you downtown
If you wanna grab a sack, go ahead and do it
My fear of death was set in place by a lie
I glorified youth as the only way of life, yeah
My teeth were shakin', slowly, surely dissipating
Yeah, the wrinkles on my face, they weren't from my old age
I try to understand you throwin' it away
All your talent down the drain, man, it just makes perfect sense
[Pre-Chorus]
When I look you in the eyes, it takes me right back
Yeah, your future helps me move on from my dark past
[Chorus]
Don't give in
It's not real
You're dead by choice
Choose to feel
[Verse 2]
Your words insane, man, only if I was left-brained
I could understand all your funny logic
I was indifferent, I saw the first time
Come on back, come on back, come on back to gain your life
Yeah, man, it's hard when that loco keeps on moving
Got some money and some change just to wait for my train
I try to stop me, now I'm locked and engaged
Come on back, come on back, come on back and leave your pain
[Pre-Chorus]
When I look you in the eyes, it takes me right back
Yeah, your future helps me move on from my dark past
[Chorus]
Don't give in
It's not real
You're dead by choice
Choose to feel
[Verse 3]
Yeah, we found you laying in your hotel room
With your arm all tied up 'cause you were actin' a fool
We started shaking you all in your bed
Doing everything we could just hoping that you're not dead
We dragged you out and threw you into our car
Pushed the pedal to the floor, drove to the hospital yard
They brought you in and told us both to wait
I was praying to myself it's not too late
Yeah
[Outro]
(Leave your bed of concrete)
There are consequences for your actions
There are consequences in real life
(Living hand to mouth)
There are consequences, you can't escape from 'em
There are consequences
(Leave your bed of concrete)
Don't hide behind your reasons
Real life is full of feeling
(Living hand to mouth)
Things come and go in seasons
Truth should transcend our feelings
(Leave your bed of concrete)
Don't hide behind your reasons
Real life is full of feeling
(Living hand to mouth)
Things come and go in seasons
Truth should transcend our feelings
