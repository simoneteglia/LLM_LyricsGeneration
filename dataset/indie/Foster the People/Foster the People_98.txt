[Intro]
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
[Drop]
I can see
I can see
I can see
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
It's clearer than it was before
You can hide, you can hide, you can hide
But you don't see what I do
[Chorus]
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
I can see every color in you
And I can feel every color in me
[Drop]
I can see
I can see
I can see
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, you're alive, we're alive
It's clearer than it was before
You can hide, you can hide, you can hide
I'll help you see what I do
[Chorus]
I can see every color in you (I can see)
And I can feel every color in me (And I can see every color in you)
And I can see every color in you (And I can feel every color)
And I can feel every color in me
[Drop]
I can see
I can see
I can see
I can see
