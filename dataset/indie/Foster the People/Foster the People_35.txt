[Verse 1]
Face me and embrace the pressure
We were made for another time
(When you need me, I'll be there)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Let's drift away in fits of pleasure
You're a beautiful design
(Say you need me, face your fears)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Yeah, just floating with my hands up
All street and gold dust
Caught up in the flux
Tell me when I've crossed the line
(When you need me, I'll be there)
(Say my name and I'll appear)
Yeah, I'm livin' in another thought
Trap's caught me tripping out
Love, please open up
I've been gone too long
(When you need me, I'll appear)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
[Chorus]
I'll fall into you
When you give in to me
You can be my only when we lose control
I won't hold back
Are you living the truth of chasing the dream?
Just killed the lone wolf
Yeah, giving up control
[Post-Chorus]
I've been looking for an answer
I've been running out of time
I've been looking for an answer
I've been waiting for a sign
Just say that you'll be there
[Verse 2]
Free your self-reflective color
Yeah, I know how to make you shine
(When you need me, I'll be there)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Face your fate, you pretty faker
Lay back and catch the light
(Say you need me, face your fears)
(Say my name, yeah, I'm right here)
Yeah, I'm just floating with my hands up
All street and gold dust
Love, please open up
Yeah, I've been gone too long
When I drift away, it feels so wrong
[Chorus]
I'll fall into you
When you give in to me
You can be my only when we lose control
I won't hold back
Are you living the truth of chasing the dream?
Just killed the lone wolf
Yeah, giving up control
[Bridge]
Just say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be there
[Outro]
I'll fall into you
Just give in to me
This'll be my only
I'll fall into you
Just give in to me
Yeah, I'm giving up control now
Giving up control
This'll be my only
Yeah, I'm giving up control
