[Hook]
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want
[Verse 1]
Yeah we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
Cause I gotta keep myself free
You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruises from all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets from your expectancies
Yeah yeah
[Pre-Hook]
We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
Yeah you've crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back, just sayin
We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't be bought so you can just
[Hook]
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want
[Verse 2]
You've taken your words and you take your judgments
And stick them onto everything
If it don't conform to what you were born into
Then you run the other way
You say, "now what's your style and who do you listen to?" Who cares?
Well that rat race ladder-climbing fake-face smile's got nothing on me
[Pre-Hook]
We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
Yeah you've crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back, just sayin
We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't be bought so you can just
[Hook]
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want
[Outro]
What you want
Call it what you want
You can call it what you want
What you want
Call it what you want
What you want
You can call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want
