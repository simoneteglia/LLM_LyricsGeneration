[Verse 1]
Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading
And everywhere I look, there's a dead end waiting
Temperature's dropping at the rotten oasis
Stealing kisses from the leperous faces
[Verse 2]
Heads are hanging from the garbage man trees
Mouthwash, jukebox, gasoline
Pistols are pointing at a poor man's pockets
Smiling eyes with modern sockets
[Chorus]
I got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
[Verse 3]
Love machines on the sympathy crutches
Discount orgies on the dropout buses
Hitching a ride with bleeding noses
Coming to town with the briefcase blues
[Chorus]
I got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
[Verse 4]
Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading
Ghetto-blasting disintegrating
Rock and roll, you don't know what I'm sayin'
Everywhere I look, there's a devil waiting
[Chorus]
I got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
Got a devil's haircut in my mind
