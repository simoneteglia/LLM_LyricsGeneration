[Verse 1]
All my friends are, they're on vacation
But I'm just stuck here in this parking lot
Well, looking for a mirror, I'm looking at a screen
These pixelated dreams are blowing up my pocket
I'll find some action, we'll cut the scene
I'm on a merry-go-round, I'm in a washing machine
Just spinning
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All of my friends, they don't do any favors
Unless they're partyin', then they got all of 'em
All of my friends, they blow all of the paycheck
They got no money because they're dumb and reckless
[Chorus]
But I love my friends, I love my friends
We got each other, don't need no others
All of my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true
[Verse 2]
Well, I've been caught up in the action
Eating fire and smoke
It's so breezy 'til we're crashin' and I'm all alone
You know it's nothing new, yeah, we've been here before
But let's take it to my house 'cause I know we want more, mmm
[Pre-Chorus 2]
All of my friends, they're crawling on the weekend
Looking for something 'cause there's nothing to do, mmm
And all my friends, they always end up leaving
For something better when it's time to cruise
[Chorus]
I love my friends, I love my friends
We got each other, don't need no others
All of my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true
[Bridge]
We're unfazed, man, we'll make it through okay
Even though the days feel long and the nights feel just the same
Well,
I believe the hearts that drink from the stars stay satisfied
To live in a safer place veiled in a peaceful paradise
[Outro]
All of my friends, I love my friends
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true
Yeah
We're a disaster
Yeah
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true
We're a disaster
We're a disaster, yeah, you know it's true
