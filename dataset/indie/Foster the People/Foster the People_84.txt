[Verse 1]
Robert's got a quick hand
He’ll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he’s a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden in a box of fun things
And I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you
[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
[Verse 2]
Daddy works a long day
He's coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
’Cause dinner’s in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I’ve waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, "Your hair's on fire, must've lost your wits," yeah
[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
