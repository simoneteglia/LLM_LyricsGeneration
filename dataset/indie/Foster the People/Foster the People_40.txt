[Verse 1]
Well Mr. Jones took a terrible fall
He had built the stairs but he hadn't counted them all
And the lights and the pain said it would rain
He said it would snow
He always said that, wherever he would go
And he would write down his thoughts on the wall
[Pre Chorus 1]
Something about the power of it all
Call if you care for me at all
I've been surrounded by this loneliness
And if I could I would do it all over again
And I would be calm and wait for you
To show me all the things that no one else can do
Now what you need, what you got, what you want from me
I've got the wild inside to conquer and then I'll be free
[Chorus 1]
If I was free, if I was free
I would fly in between the moons of consciousness
And ride on the back of a shooting star
And float into your arms
[Verse 2]
And when he woke up, he went outside and changed the light bulb
Figured out that life was worth living when you could see
The doctor said they'd counseled him before and his tired mind of war
[Pre Chorus 2]
But he was at war with himself and he lost it all
He was at home now feeling the power of the crumbling wall
[Chorus 2]
Oh, if I was free
I'd fly in between the moons of indolence
And I'd ride on the back of a shooting star
And float into your arms
If I was free
I'd let go of all the weight that's dragging me
And never again and never again
I put it all down and never again and never again
[Bridge]
Ahhh
Never again
Ahhh
[Verse 3]
And he met God that day
And God said, "Well, welcome in
I've been waiting for you
Your bed is warm, your sheets are made"
[Chorus 3]
Free, and I was free
I didn't even know that I'd been captured
But I remember the call, I remember the call
I remember when your voice came through the wall
And I was there and I was scared
I didn't even know that you were listening
And all those times I was shaking my head
From all the things I'd said
[Outro]
Ahhh
