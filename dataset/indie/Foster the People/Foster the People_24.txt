[Intro]
One
Yeah
Mmm
[Verse 1]
And there she goes
She's sitting real nice with her head full of advice from friends
And she walks around
She tries to rearrange, but everything goes under her bed
And it's countless
She's got a jar full of change saved up for vacation
And she's watching
She's watching her sons growing up just like their mom
And it's hard for her
[Chorus]
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
You gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard, but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose
[Verse 2]
She's got a call from a guy just seeing if she's alright
(Better not panic, better not panic, better not panic)
She's got a face full of tears held back by the strength of five
Mmm
And she says, "Happiness ain't free, everybody fights just like me
But I've given up the ability to retreat"
[Chorus]
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
You gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard, but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose
[Bridge]
Yeah, there's time for us to figure it out
I'm there, so don't be scared
There's time for us to figure it out
Don't be, don't be scared
[Outro]
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
All alone, rest your head (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
On my lap when you're down (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
All alone, rest your head (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
On my lap when you're down (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
Ooh, Ruby, don't cry (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby) 'Cause I am here, and I am here
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby) So don't you cry 'cause it'll be alright
