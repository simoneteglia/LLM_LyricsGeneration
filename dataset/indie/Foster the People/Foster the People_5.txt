[Verse 1]
Sometimes life, it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head
Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show 'em what I choose, got nothing to lose, oh
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
[Verse 2]
You know those days when you wanna just choose
To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again
You play the game, but you kind of cut
'Cause you're coming down hard, your joints are all stuck
I've tried to say that it's not the only way
I never knew if I could face myself to change
You were pacing, I was insecure
Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, hug the prison I've been living in
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison
Took a sip of something poison, poison
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison
Took a sip of something poison, poison
[Outro]
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
