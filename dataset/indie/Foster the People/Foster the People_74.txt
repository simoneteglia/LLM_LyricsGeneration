Yeah, we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well, I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
'Cause I gotta keep myself free
You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruises
From all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets
From your expectancies, yeah, yeah
Ooh, we got nothing to lose
You better run and hide, yeah, you crossed the line
I got a knife behind my back, just sayin'
Ooh, we got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I got can't be bought, so you can just
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want
You've taken your words and you take your judgments
And stick 'em onto everything
If it don't conform to what you were born into
Then you run the other way
You say, "Now what's your style and who do you listen to?"
Who cares?
Well, that rat race ladder-climbing fake-face smile's
Got nothing on me, yeah, yeah
Ooh, we got nothing to lose
You better run and hide, yeah, you crossed the line
I got a knife behind my back, just sayin'
Ooh, we got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I got can't be bought, so you can just
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want
Want, want, want, want
What you want, want, want
Call it what you want, want, want
You can call it what you want
Eh, eh, eh, call it what you want
You can call it, you can call it what you want
What you want, want, want
Call it what you, call it what you want
What you want, want, want
You can call it what you want
