[Verse 1]
I see myself in the pouring home
I see the light come over now
I see myself in the pouring rain
I watch hope come over me
[Chorus]
Here we are now, going to the east side
I pick up my friends and we start to ride
Ride all night and we ride all day
Some may come and some may stay
[Verse 2]
Here we are in the pouring home
I watch the light man fall and comb
I watch a light move across the screen
I watch the light come over me
[Chorus]
Herе we are now, going to the wеst side
Weapons in hand as we go for a ride
Some may come and some may stay
Watching out for a sunny day
[Bridge]
Where there's
Love and darkness and my sidearm
Hail on and on
[Chorus]
Here we are now, going to the north side
I look at my friends as they start to ride
Ride all night and we ride all day
Looking out for the sunny day
Here we are now, going to the south side (To the south side)
I pick up my friends and we hope we won't die (Hope we won't die)
Ride at night, ride through heaven and hell (Heaven and hell)
Come back alone, then I feel so well
[Outro]
Feel so well
Feel so well
Feel well
