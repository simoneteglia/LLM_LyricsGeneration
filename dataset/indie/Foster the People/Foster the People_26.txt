[Verse 1]
Well, I've been trying to re-learn my name
It seems like a thousand years
That I've been out of frame
And I surrender, the truth is what
It's what I've needed from you
'Cause I've been floating within your walls of opinion
And I'm tired, I only want the truth
[Chorus]
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean
There is a truth, there is a light if you'd follow me there
I've been searching for the directions and
I'm convinced the world doesn't know what it needs
There is a hope for the hopeless, I can promise you that
[Verse 2]
Yeah, well, I've been accosted, the jury's been partial
But I won't surrender to prove to you I won't lie
Under pressure of compromise
Yeah, well, an absolute measure won't change with opinion
No matter how hard you try
It's an immovable thing
Just like the visions in your bed
Or when they're streaming in your head
[Chorus]
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean
There is a truth, there is a light if you'd follow me there
I've been searching for the directions and
I'm convinced the world doesn't know what it needs
There is a hope, and I'll come back
[Post-Chorus]
If you're leading my hand, the world is so broken
I'm tripping my steps, I'm slipping and I know why
I never thought that I'd be here
A blinding call to prayer has touched my feet
Like the call of the prophets
A purpose is needed before you know that you know
To never wonder what you are
And not forget where you've come from
[Bridge]
Yeah, ooh
Mmm, well
Is it really love you've been speaking of?
Oh, what'd you say? What'd you say?
What'd you say? Yeah, what'd you say?
I said that you need me, don't you?
[Chorus]
There is a truth, I can promise you that
I have tried so hard not to be like them
I have found they don't ever say what they mean
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
The truth, the truth stands in the end
While you're deciding what to do
The truth stands in the end
While you're deciding what to do
