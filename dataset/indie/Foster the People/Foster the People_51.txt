[Intro]
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
[Verse 1]
Round six, I smoked a nebula and leveled up
Just ring the bell, knocked him from the heavens into Hell
(Intergalactic triad killer)
Eyes opened up like Christmas
Kicking fits and foaming at the mouth, just like a drunken Orson Welles
(You big sucka, I got you now)
Kick back, stick a move, the ones and twos will always tell the truth
The new Moses parting rooms full of laughter
I rock a black tie like a 1960s massacre
[Bridge]
(Extra, extra, you can read all about it)
[Outro]
I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong
Dying to dodge the draft like an upper cut, strip the title, snap the cuffs
Yeah, I called the bluff on all you racist mother-what! (And I won)
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Put it back, get on the vibe with us
Float like a butterfly, sting like an army
Float like a butterfly, sting like an army
