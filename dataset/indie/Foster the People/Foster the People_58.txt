Robert’s got a quick hand
He’ll look around the room
He won’t tell you his plan
He’s got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth
He’s a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a 6-shooter gun
In his dad's closet
In a box of fun things
I don’t even know what
But he’s coming for you
Yeah, he’s coming for you
[Refren x2]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late
And he’s coming home late
And he’s bringing me a surprise
Cause dinner’s in the kitchen
And it’s packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand
Is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say "Your hair’s on fire
You must've lost your wits, yeah?"

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
