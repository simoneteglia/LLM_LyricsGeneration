[Verse 1]
Kim and Jessie
They have a secret world in the twilight
Kids outside worlds
They're crazy 'bout romance and illusions
[Chorus]
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Dream dressed in blue
It's all they need for now and forever
Chased by the moon
They shatter their whole peace with singing
[Chorus]
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
So we can drown our towns with voices
So possible to like it as one
And soon they'll be flying
Say of course, say you're lovely
[Chorus]
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Somebody whispers
Somebody lurks in the shadows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
