[Verse 1]
I woke up stronger than ever
Driven by big waves of fire
To run and yell all the way
Nothing can hurt me today
[Chorus]
There's a magic inside
Just waiting to burst out
The world is a goldmine
That will melt tomorrow
[Verse 2]
I just can't recognize myself
Tears of joy run all over my face
My sensations reach the limit
Nothing can hurt me today
[Chorus]
There's a magic inside
Just waiting to burst out
The world is a goldmine
That will melt tomorrow
[Outro]
Living for, living for a thrill
Just waiting, just waiting!
Just waiting, just waiting!
Just waiting, just waiting!
Just waiting, just waiting!
Just waiting, just waiting!
