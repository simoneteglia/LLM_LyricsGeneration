[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
At night the city grows
Look at the horizon glow
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2]
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word (Word)
Looking at the milky skyline (Skyline)
The city is my church (The city is my church)
It wraps me in its blinding twilight (Twilight)
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro]
Waiting in the car
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark (Ride in the dark)
Waiting in the car (Car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark
Waiting in the car (Waiting in the car)
Waiting for the ride in the dark
[Saxophone Solo]
