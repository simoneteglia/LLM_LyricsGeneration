[Verse 1: Ben Pleng &
Lisa Papineau
]
Kiss on the mouth
Bliss of a touch
Hand in a hand
Killing the fiend
I'll write my love on more than a
Thousand weeping willows
A walk on your voice
So far, so close
A whispering child
So calm, so mild
All the colors mixed up in
Falls of rainbows
[Verse 2: Ben Pleng &
Lisa Papineau
]
Tears on your neck
Holding you near
Sparkling shells
Three comet tails
Hoping for some magic
To make your heart beat next to mine
Shiny island
Blue underground
My everyday
Is fading away
I'm flying through the wind
And whistling some strange melody
[Verse 3: Ben Pleng &
Lisa Papineau
]
Hang on to me
Getting out of my corpse
Please dont leave me
Watching you from the clouds
Melancholy
You'll join me soon my love
Feeling frozen
I'll warm you every night
Falling asleep
I'll travel in your dreams
