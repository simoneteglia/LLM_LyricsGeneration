[Verse 1]
Like a moth she moves to the red light
Her blood warms and boils there
She skims the sweat like a new milk
And pops the buttons of her wet blouse
[Chorus]
Oh, queen of the night
(All of her soft parts call to me)
Well she is deep inside
(She could be mine)
She is haunting me
[Verse 2]
She digs her nails into her naked chest
Her veins fan out like a road map
She pulls back the skin to show her ribs
That twinkle like shooting stars
[Chorus]
Oh, queen of the night
(All of her soft parts call to me)
Well she is deep inside
(She could be mine)
She is haunting me
