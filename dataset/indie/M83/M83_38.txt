[Verse 1]
Alone, twenty millions years from my place
A slide, on the starlight
Watch out, a new planet right on my trail!
The space, oh oh it's mine!
Oh oh!
[Chorus 1]
Oh oh oh!
Oh!
Oh oh oh!
[Verse 2]
I'm lost, in an infinite night trip
The sun, could make me blind
I wish (I wish), I could bring a girl to my ship
And fly, (Oh oh!) her hand in mine!
[Chorus 2]
Oh oh oh!
Oh!
Oh oh oh!
Oh!
Oh oh oh!
Oh!
Oh oh oh!
[Verse 3]
Alone, twenty million years from my place
(Is the dream over?)
The space, oh oh it's mine!
Oh oh oh!
