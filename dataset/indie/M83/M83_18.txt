[Verse 1]
Each shade of blue
Is kept in our eyes
Keep blowing and lightning
Because we own the sky
[Chorus]
Secrets from the winds
Burnt stars crying
[Verse 2]
Soft soft or cruel
Can't we change our minds?
We kill what we build
Because we own the sky
[Chorus]
Secrets from the winds
Burnt stars crying
So many moons here
Lost wings floating
[Outro]
It's coming, it's coming now!
It's coming, it's coming now!
What's coming? What's coming now?
What's coming? What's coming now?
It's coming from the sky
It's coming like the wind
