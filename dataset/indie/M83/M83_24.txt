[Verse 1]
There's a hole in your heart, begging for adventure
Play yourself a new track, set traps for the future
[Pre-Chorus]
On your own
Can you do it?
The unknown
Can you face it?
[Chorus]
Shifting desire
Shifting desire
Shifting desire
[Verse 2]
Rules of conformity, heavy clouds of reason
They're hiding the beauty of your free distortions
[Pre-Chorus]
On your own
Can you do it?
The unknown
Can you face it?
With your soul, now you see it
The landscape is infinite
[Chorus]
Shifting desire
Shifting desire
Shifting desire
