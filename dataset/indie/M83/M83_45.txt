[Chorus]
If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air
If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air
[Verse 1]
Oh, you lovely boy, you smell so sweet
We ride so well
And we load our pistols as we perch upon
My razor wings
[Pre-Chorus]
Up to the planets, up to the bodies of the galaxy
We fly, we feed, we suck, we bleed, we need
[Chorus]
If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air
If I clean my rocket
We'll go flying today
And we'll hit the pockets
Of warm and crispy air
[Verse 2]
Oh, we flee the scene of our little crime
We feel so free
But the hounds of law, they bite our heels
As we retreat
[Pre-Chorus]
Up to the planets up to the bodies of the galaxy
We fly, we feed, we suck, we bleed, we need
[Chorus]
If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pockets
If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pockets
If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pockets
If I clean my rocket
And we'll hit the pockets
