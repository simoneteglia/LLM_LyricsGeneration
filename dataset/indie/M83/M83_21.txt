[Verse 1]
Taking a foreign flight
Looking for signs of life
When you flashed upon my screen
Testing the atmosphere
Your silhouette appears
And I know I'm not alone
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But empty haze
Is all that remains
I'm lost on the sidewalk
Just calling your name
[Chorus]
I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway
[Verse 2]
Live via satellite
Checking my vital signs
Because it all feels so unreal
Everything good must end
But we can live again
In the glass
simulacra
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't replace
Your ethereal waves
I sleep on the concrete
And dream of days
[Chorus]
I sleep on the concrete everything's changed
You walked off with someone new anyway
I'm lost on the sidewalk calling your name
I can't stand to see you walking away
I'm lost on the sidewalk (calling your name)
I can't stand to see you walking away
I sleep on the concrete (everything's changed)
You walked off with someone new anyway
