[Verse 1: Anthony Gonzalez]
What do you think I feel when I, when I, take it with you?
What do you think I see when I, when I, take it with you?
[Chorus: Anthony Gonzalez]
Somewhere else, somewhere, somewhere else
Somewhere else, somewhere, somewhere else
[Verse 2: Anthony Gonzalez]
What do you think I feel when I, when I'm kissing you?
[Chorus: Anthony Gonzalez]
Somewhere else, somewhere, somewhere else
Somewhere else, somewhere, somewhere else
[Monologue: Chelsea Alden]
We're walking in the streets - or what's left of them
I take your hand, and the city is slowly vanishing
There's no crowd anymore, no cars, no signals
But in the middle of the road, a purple and mellow shape is floating
The shape of our mutual dream
Stay calm, hold me tight, give it a chance to take us away
[Outro: Anthony Gonzalez]
We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world
We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world
We will live, we will dream on the shadow of our world
