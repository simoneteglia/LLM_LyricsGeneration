[Verse 1]
Lost memories
Faded pictures
Can you drive me back
To this very moment
[Chorus 1]
Julia
Alexander
Where did you all go?
Love
[Verse 2]
Old memory
From the limbo
From the night
[Verse 3]
Lost memory
Coming back
Remember the sun
Remember the colors
[Chorus 2]
Julia
Alexander
Let me feel you all
Love
