[Intro]
They say I made the Moon. Everything was in the dark. No memories at all, just a tiny freezing wind in my back, and I was sitting there, singing a song I had never heard before.

[Outro]
My first vision was a bush growing down the river, and I couldn't stop crying. Something was missing. I realized I was in love with the voice. I called it, again, and again, but all I heard was the echo in the light
