[Verse 1]
I believe in the darkness
It's just a sound
I'm in love with some sadness
It's just a sound
[Pre-Chorus]
Ride with me
[Chorus]
Slipping through
My virtual magnet
Kiss the rush of me and you
Automated bliss
Blinding all over the touch of your hand
Metal rapture
Four minutes with you
[Verse 2]
I'm in love with the darkness
It's just a sound
Nothing wrong with some sadness
It's just a sound
[Pre-Chorus]
Ride with me
[Chorus]
Slipping through
My virtual magnet
Kiss the rush of me and you
Automated bliss
Blinding all over the touch of your hand
Metal rapture
Four minutes with you
[Outro]
So let's burn
Fast and bright
'Cause we will bleed
Die inside me
Floating for a miracle
Likе pixies
Guide me to thе last realm
This crimson love
It's a miracle
