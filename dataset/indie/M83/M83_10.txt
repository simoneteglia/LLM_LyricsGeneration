[Verse 1: Haim]
Arms to the ground
Far from the rivers
Grace in our tears
High on a fever
Somebody heal me from my pain
[Refrain: Haim]
I'm reaching closer
My stars have lowered
Filling up lost memories
[Chorus: Haim]
Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody tell me this is real
[Verse 2: Haim]
Hands to the sky
I am a dreamer
We build the hope
We are believers
Somebody free me from my chains
[Refrain: Haim]
I'm reaching closer
My stars have lowered
Filling up my memories
[Chorus: Haim]
Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody pull me from the dark
[Outro: Haim]
Arms to the ground
Far from the rivers
Somebody heal me from my pain
Hands to the sky (hands in the sky)
I am a dreamer (I am a dreamer)
Somebody free me from my chains (free me from my chains)
