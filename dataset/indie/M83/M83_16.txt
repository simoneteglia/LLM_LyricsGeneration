[Verse 1: Anthony Gonzalez]
You came out of nowhere
Stealing my heart and brain
Flaming my every cell
You make me feel myself
[Chorus: Anthony Gonzalez]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Will you stay in this land forever?
Will you stay in this land forever?
[Verse 2: Anthony Gonzalez]
Across the time and space
A never-ending dance
A blooming and a trance
You make me feel my soul
There's no more loneliness
Only sparkles and sweat
There's no more single fate
You make me feel myself
[Chorus: Anthony Gonzalez]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Will you stay in this land forever?
Will you stay in this land forever?
[Monologue: Morgan Kibby]
My body is like a lightning rod
Capsize me and douse me in your bay
A shiver of want, always
When you are on the tip of my tongue
In the back of your parked car
I could build a fort
And play all day
Between your lips, and mine
Let's stay here forever
[Chorus: Anthony Gonzalez]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohohoh...
Will you stay in this land forever?
Will you stay in this land forever?
