[Verse 1: Susanne Sundfør]
Where are you now?
Who do you go to for a shoulder to cry on?
I hope that some day you might turn around and come back home
[Verse 2: Susanne Sundfør]
Where are you now?
When will I see your face again?
No matter how far apart we become you know that I'll still hear your song
[Monologue:
Zelly Meldal-Johnsen
]
This is the day. This is our day, mom
If we believe it, it will happen
I am everywhere, you remember?
I'm in the water, on the mirror
The strange flower you saw in the forest
I'm the morning dust tickling your neck
I am the wind, mommy
And the wind is never sad...
He's brave, and soft, and furious sometimes
Soon I'll be strong enough to make you fly with me
And nothing will ever stop us then
[Verse 3: Susanne Sundfør]
I don't know when I'll see you again
But I know that my love will last for eternity
I'll wait till the stars go dark for you to come back to me
