Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
At night, the city grows
Look at the horizon glow
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word
Looking at the milky skyline
The city is my church
It wraps me in its blinding twilight
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
