I was driving at the dawn
But everywhere I go, everywhere I go I see you
Calling love to the land
‘Cause anything I do, anything I do
Is about you
I was searching at the speed of sound
And I go up and down until I hit the ground
I need someone
I was falling through the universe
I went forward and reverse
To forget about you
Now you get me
Just another soul to break
Evil is God and I’m going straight to Hell
