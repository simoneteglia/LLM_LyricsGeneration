(It's all under control) It's all under control
All you need is time, all you need is...
Time
Time
It's all under control
It's all under control
It's all under control

Then it can be turned
All you need is time

All you need is time
All you need is...
We'd promised the world we'd tame it
We'd promised the world we'd tame it
We'd promised the world we'd tame it
A sense of purpose and a sense of skill
A sense of function but a disregard
We will not be the first
We will not be the first
We will not be the first
New frontiers
Bloody head
We'd promised the world we'd tame it
What were we hoping for?
What were we hoping for?
We'd promised the world we'd tame it
What were we hoping for?
What were we hoping for?
