[Intro]
Dry heart
A loss of all desire
Flee to the moon hill
[Pre-Chorus]
Bliss, you're it
[Chorus]
Night of gold
Incoming
[Verse]
Hello, freak
Can you see the sky ladder
By the limbo caf√©
Leading to the green ray?
Sometimes it fades
[Chorus]
Night of gold
Incoming
Night of gold
Incoming
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Night of gold
Incoming
Night of gold
Incoming
