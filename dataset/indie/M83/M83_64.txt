[Refrain]
All we want
Till the end of time
All we love
Till the end of time
[Chorus]
Do you miss the day
Of human revolution?
What a good way to learn
From the hand of a legend
An illusion
On color television
What a good way to learn
About us
And the heirs of our land
[Refrain]
All we want
Till the end of time
All we love
Till the end of time
[Chorus]
Do you miss the day
Of human revolution
What a good way to learn
From the hand of a legend
An illusion
On color television
What a good way to learn
Good way to learn
About us
And the heirs of our land
[Bridge]
An illusion
Television
An illusion
Television
[Instrumental Outro]
