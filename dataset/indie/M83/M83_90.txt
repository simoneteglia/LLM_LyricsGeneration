Each shade of blue
Is kept in our eyes
Keep blowing and lighting
Because we own the sky
Secrets from the winds
Burnt stars crying
Soft soft or cruel
Can't we change our minds?
We kill what we build
Because we own the sky
Secrets from the winds
Burnt stars crying
So many moons here
Lost wings floating
It's coming, it's coming now!
It's coming, it's coming now!
What's coming? What's coming now?
What's coming? What's coming now?
It's coming from the sky
It's coming from the wind
