[Radio chatter]
[Sample]
It's back
Maybe the instruments failed and maybe they didn't, there's only one way we're going to find out
Sorry
It wasn't your fault, Ellen... but make sure you get the reports to Washington before morning
Yes sir
Tell them we'll bring the satellite down for a full examination
Yes sir
Pete, can you handle the recovery procedure all right by yourself?
All I have to do is wait 'til she's at 43 North, push a couple buttons?
Secretary Platt is going to want to know where she went and why, that means examination of every instrument on board. If anything else goes wrong, call me at home
Goodnight
Goodnight
This is Anderson, acknowledge
Where are you?
Yes, yes...
It's true, I am your only friend, nobody even knows you exist, but they will...
It'll be the greatest day in the history of mankind
Come to bed, Tom
