[Verse 1]
Death is her boyfriend
She spits on summers and smiles to the night
She collects crowns made of black roses
But her heart is made of bubble gum
[Refrain]
Graveyard girl
[Verse 2]
Dark rags and red stars
She's the dirty witch of her high school
She worships Satan like a father
But dreams of a sister like Molly Ringwald
[Refrain]
Graveyard girl
[Interlude]
I'm gonna jump the walls and run
I wonder if they'll miss me?
I won't miss them
The cemetery is my home
I want to be a part of it
Invisible even to the night
Then I'll read poetry to the stones
Maybe one day I could be one of them...
Wise and silent
Waiting for someone to love me
Waiting for someone to kiss me
I'm fifteen years old
And I feel it's already too late to live
Don't you?
[Refrain]
Graveyard girl
Graveyard girl
Graveyard girl
Graveyard girl
Graveyard girl
Graveyard girl
Graveyard girl
