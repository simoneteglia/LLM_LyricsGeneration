[Verse 1]
Have you ever had the feeling
That we're not alone?
All the calls I’ve been receiving
They are not from home
Going down the dusty roads
We couldn’t see through
I need you
[Verse 2]
There’s a reading on the wall
Of all the things that I have done
And we’re leaving it all
Run away, take my my hand
[Verse 3]
Sitting all alone
Just the colors of the world
