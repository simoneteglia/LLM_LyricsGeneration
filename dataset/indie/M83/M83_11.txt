[Intro]
Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it
[Verse 1]
Listen to the sound
Of a new tomorrow
Take over my dreams
Walk into the feeling
[Chorus]
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
[Post-Chorus]
Do it, try it
Do it, try it
Do it
[Verse 2]
Listen to the sound
Like a shout in the night
Moving at the tempo
Of a broken song
[Chorus]
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
[Bridge]
Listen to the sound
Of a broken heart
Calling for a sign of love
Heal me up (try it, do it)
Back me down (try it, do it)
Turn me on (try it, do it)
And I'm alone (do it)
[Chorus]
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
A dance on repeat
A trance on a hard beat
[Outro]
Heal me up
Back me down
Turn me on
I'm alone
Heal me up
Back me down
Turn me on
I'm alone
Try it all
Do it, try it
Do it
Try it
