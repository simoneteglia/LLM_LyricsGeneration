[Verse 1]
Small town, too hot
I'm going for a trip
A place where dreams are made like comic strips
I see colours and planes, laser guns and champagne
I feel strong and smart, ready for a new start
It got me too
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
What it makes me do
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
So let's go and get it
[Chorus 1]
Everything we've been dreaming
So let's go and get it
All the things we've been missing
[Verse 2]
Now my blood is gone
And my face is drawn
Seven legs on top
And my heart just popped
[Verse 3]
People love me though
I'm their new Rambo
This is my kingdom
A different kind of home
You got me too
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
What it makes me do
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's surprising
What brain can do
I can hardly believe it
So let's go and get it
[Chorus 1]
Everything we've been dreaming
So let's go and get it
All the things we've been missing
[Chorus 2]
Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got everything
Got everything
[Chorus 3]
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need
Got all I need
Got all I need
[Chorus 2]
Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got everything
Got everything
[Chorus 3]
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need
Got all I need
Got all I need
[Bridge]
All you can do is keep dreaming, dreaming
It's up to you, the meaning, the meaning
All you can do is keep dreaming, dreaming
It's up to you, the meaning, the meaning
[Chorus 2]
Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got everything
Got everything
[Chorus 3]
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need
Got all I need
Got all I need
[Chorus 2]
Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got everything
Got everything
[Chorus 3]
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need
Got all I need
Got all I need
[Chorus 2]
Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got everything
Got everything
[Chorus 3]
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need
Got all I need
Got all I need
[Counter]
Take me on a rollercoaster
Up and down and up and down
Ride, ride on a rollercoaster
I'm going up, I'm going down
[Chorus 2]
Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got everything
Got everything
[Chorus 3]
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need
Got all I need
Got all I need
[Counter]
Take me on a rollercoaster
Up and down and up and down
Ride, ride on a rollercoaster
I'm going up, I'm going down
[Chorus 2]
Got it all PAM!
Got everything
Got everything
Got everything
[Chorus 3]
Got it all PAM!
Got all I need
Got all I need
Got all I need
[Outro]
Got it all PAM!
