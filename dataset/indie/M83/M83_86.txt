[Intro]
Guns, razors, knives!
Fuck with me
Guns, razors, knives!
[Chorus]
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
[Verse 1]
Let's writhe, let me see you trip
One move that will keep you wet
Let's fall in a long sadistic trance
Put the keys in our hands
[Chorus]
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
[Verse 2]
Let's sail in this sea of charms
Let's drown underneath the stars
Let's drink with our weapons in our hands
Let's sleep in this trance
[Chorus]
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
[Bridge]
Guns, razors, knives!
Guns, razors, knives!
[Chorus]
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
