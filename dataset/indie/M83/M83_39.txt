[Verse 1]
Hold us in your arms
We're not feeling much
The provenance of the call
Is where I want to be
[Chorus]
'Cause when you hold us
It's electric
And when you lead us
[Verse 2]
Take us on a ride
I'll take you on a voyage through the night sky
Before we lose control
And it's okay to lose control, it's time to fly
The distance of the soul
Well, there's no distance in the soul, you are a limitless star
Is where I want to be
You're wrapped up tight with me
[Chorus]
'Causе when you hold us
It's electric
And whеn you lead us
[Post-Chorus]
We look deep into the heavens
We are the planet makers
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro]
I am the mother of all
Over every galaxy
There is no one but me
I am the mother of all
Immortal energy
Faceless wonder
I am the mother of all
Over every galaxy
There is no one but me
I am the mother of all
Immortal energy
Faceless wonder
