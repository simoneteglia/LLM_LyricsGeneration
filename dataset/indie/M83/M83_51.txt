[Verse 1]
Everyone already knew your name
It's written in the clouds
It's like you talk to them in dreams
It's like you know our signs, right?
[Chorus 1]
Keep looking
Stand by
Cross a blue ridge
Slow car
[Verse 2]
You don't have to show your face
We only look inside, you see
It's like you only talk in tears
It's like you know our fears, right?
[Chorus 2]
Stop looking
Come by
Is it our last chance
To be friends?
[Bridge]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah
