[Verse 1]
As a young girl, Louis Vuitton
With your mother on a sandy lawn
As a sophomore with reggaeton
And the linens you're sittin' on
[Chorus]
Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Post-Chorus]
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But it feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
[Verse 2]
Can you stay up to see the dawn?
In the colors of Benetton
[Chorus]
Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to,
like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Post-Chorus]
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you wanna,
like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
