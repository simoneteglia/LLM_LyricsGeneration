[Verse 1]
It's gonna take a little time while you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park,
backseat on the 79

So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab

Up one more flight, see the Buddha on the second floor
Coronation rickshaw grab
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have
[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh

No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass
