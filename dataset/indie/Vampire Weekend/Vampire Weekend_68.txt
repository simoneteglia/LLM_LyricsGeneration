[Intro: Hi-c]
Vampire Gang
Hi-c
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Hi-c, yuh, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go, yuh
[Verse 1: Hi-c]
Party boy Hi-c, rockstar
Walked in, bad bitches, they all on my dick
Too many, don't know who to pick
Too many, don't know who to pick
Fuck her once then I told 'em to switch
Shot her shot at me but she missed
My lifestyle is so scandalous
Pour a four of Hi-Tech in my brisk
Party boy Hi-c, where the party at?
Hunnid pack of beans
Nigga, that's a party pack
Juggin' niggas, call my phone for the molly pack
Sold his ass a [?], now that nigga keep comin' back
I ran off on the plug, I ain't comin' back
Tens, twenty, fifties, and them hunnids, need all of that
Fuck that bitch one time, I ain't comin' back
Put the dick in her bestfriend mouth tell her "Swallow that"
[Bridge: Hi-c]
Pretty boy Hi-c, fuck her on the LSD
Bitches in the Blood Rain rollin' on ecstasy
Nigga say he on his grind, lil' bro, you better be
And I gotta tote a .9, nigga, for the jealousy
(Yuh, go, go)
(Go, go)
Yeah, Hi-c, man, party boy Hi-c, bitch
You already know, vampire gang
[Verse 2: Playwithguns]
Why she keep on callin' my phone?
Can't this bitch just leave me alone?
Left that bitch, yeah, all on her own
I'm in the Blood Rain fucking on hoes
She's like, "Why you leaving, leaving?"
I been here all weekend, I'm tweaking
Vam-Vampire weekend, weekend
Blood Rain Boys, I'ma sleep in, sleep in
Woah, watch, my chain starts to glow
Took her to the back, now she's giving me throat
I just took ya main bitch, yeah, that's just how it go
Scorin' hella goals hangin out with my bros
So high, I can see shit, see shit
Off the ecstasy, fuckin' a scene bitch, scene bitch
Me and Hi-c just pulled up in a demon, you see
12 on our ass, now we're speeding, leaving
Reptilian Club Boyz, bitch
