[Verse 1]
Sunflower in the morning
Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait
[Chorus]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know
[Verse 2]
Sunflower in the evening
Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel me
Back into the daylight
Let that evil wait
[Chorus]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know
[Outro]
You know, ooh
Ooh-way-ooh
