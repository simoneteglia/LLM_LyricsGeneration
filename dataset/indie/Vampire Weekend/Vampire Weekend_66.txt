Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape
We escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell
Breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song
A song to keep us walking
There's such a chill
Such a chill
You can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
