[Verse 1]
Hudson died in Hudson Bay
The water took its victim's name
Now river's rise
told
Riverside
To change their names again
[Verse 2]
A stranger walked in through the door
Said, "All apartments are pre-war"
We laughed and asked him for his name
He stayed until the end
We watched the Germans play the Greeks
We marked the 99-year lease
Our fathers signed
Which I declined to try and comprehend
[Chorus]
Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come,
the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag
[Verse 3]
The legendary wooden gate
The first established real estate
Is lost in time like all the crimes
That won this pleasant land (land, land, land)
[Chorus]
Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come,
the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag
[Verse 4]
Hudson died on Hudson Bay
But I was born on Sutton Place
The rising tide helped me decide
To change my name again
Some men tend to linger on
And some make haste from Babylon
Some will roam their ruined home
Rejoicing 'til the end
[Chorus]
Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has come,
the clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag
[Outro]
The lines are drawn, the map is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag
