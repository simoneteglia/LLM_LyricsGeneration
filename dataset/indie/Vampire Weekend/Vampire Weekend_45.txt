[Verse 1]
Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work
[Chorus]
She said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But chang-
-ing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run
[Verse 2]
Worlds away from cars
And all the Stars and Bars
Where a little bit of condensation means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch
[Chorus]
I said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But chang-
-ing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run
[Bridge]
'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a little bata radio
We could try
[Verse 3]
So lead my feet away
'Cause all they do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised
[Chorus]
She said
"You know
There's nowhere left to go"
But with
Her fund
It struck me that the two of us could run
[Outro]
'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
If I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a battered radio
We could try, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
