[Verse 1]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, Mystic Seaport is that way
Don't you know that your life could be lost
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, the bottleneck is a shit show
Hyannisport is a ghetto
Out of Cape Cod tonight
[Verse 3]
Walcott, all the way to New Jersey
All the way to the Garden State
Out of Cape Cod tonight
Walcott, fuck the women from Wellfleet
Fuck the bears out in Provincetown
Heed my words and take flight
[Bridge]
The lobster's claw is sharp as knives
Evil feasts on human lives
The Holy Roman Empire roots for you
[Outro]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, Wa-Walcott, it's insane
Insane, insane
Out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Tonight, tonight
Tonight
Walcott, Wa-Walcott, it's insane
Insane, insane
Out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Tonight, tonight
Tonight
