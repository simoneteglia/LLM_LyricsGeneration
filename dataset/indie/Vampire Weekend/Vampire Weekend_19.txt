[Verse 1]
I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months
But even with our oath
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right
[Chorus]
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
[Verse 2]
My revolution thoughts
Your little arrows of desire
I want to trace them to the source
And the wire
But it's not useful now
Since we've both made up our minds
You're going to watch out for yourself
And so will I
[Chorus]
I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra
'Til you've tried
[Bridge]
You wanted good schools and friends with pools
You're not a contra
You wanted rock and roll, complete control
Well, I don't know
[Verse 3]
Never pick sides
Never choose between two
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you
You said, "Never pick sides
Never choose between two"
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you
[Chorus]
I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra
'Til you've tried
