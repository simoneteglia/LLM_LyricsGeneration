[Verse 1]
Holiday, oh, a holiday
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears
[Chorus]
But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear
[Verse 2]
Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth
[Chorus]
But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear
[Bridge]
A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word "bombs"
She'd never seen the word "bombs"
Blown up to 96-point Futura
She'd never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day-Glo display
A T-shirt so lovely
It turned all the history books gray
[Verse 3]
I got wheels,
I got Cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf
[Chorus]
So if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear
