[Verse 1]
Only in the way You want it
Only on the day You want it
Only with the understanding:
Every single day You want it
Only in the way You want it
Only on the day You want it
Only with the understanding:
Every single day you want it
You, You
[Verse 2]
City with the weight upon it
City in the way you want it
City with the safety
Of a never-ending blessing on it
City with the weight upon it
City in the way you want it
City with the safety
Of a never-ending blessing on it
You, You
[Chorus]
We worshipped You, Your red right hand
Won't we see you once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?
[Verse 3]
Calling on a change, You want it
Calling on the same, You want it
Calling on the misery to always be explained
You want it
Calling on a change, You want it
Calling on the same, You want it
Calling on the misery to always be explained
You want it
You, You
[Verse 4]
Energetic praise You wanted
Any kind of praise You wanted
Little bit of light
To get us through the final days You wanted
Energetic praise You wanted
Any kind of praise You wanted
Little bit of light
To get us through the final days You wanted
You, too
[Chorus]
We worshipped You, Your red right hand
Won't we see You once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?
We worshipped You, Your red right hand
Won't we see You once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?
