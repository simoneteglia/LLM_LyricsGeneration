[Verse 1]
Unsentimental, traveling around
Sure of myself, sure of it now
But you were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember, remember it well
I remember, remember it well
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat
[Bridge]
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow- Shadow of your shadow- Shadow- Shadow
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
[Verse 2]
Two-ooh-ooh-ooh
Two-ooh-ooh-ooh
Two-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a little bata radio
We could try
And a little bata radio
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's
Was a diplomat's
Was a diplomat's
Was a diplomat's
Was a diplomat's
Was a diplomat's
Was a diplomat's
Was a diplomat's
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
