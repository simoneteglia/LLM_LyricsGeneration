Honorable Mentions
15. "White Sky"
The fifth single from
Contra
is unorthodox compared to anything on Vampire Weekend's eponymous debut
, but it's only accented by its bouncing, synthy production. However, its real treat is the non-verbal hook, which is not only satisfying, but wholly enjoyable.
14. "Horchata"
13. "Step"
12. "Ladies of Cambridge"
11. "Walcott"
10. "Unbelievers"
After introducing
Modern Vampires of the City
with the
placid "Obvious Bicycle"
, Koenig and co. introduce you to the religious themes of the album like a slap to the face with "Unbelievers." The uptempo pace and
pop-friendly
production somehow manage to complement the wittiness of lyrics like:
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train
Iâ€™m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
9. "A-Punk"
8. "Hannah Hunt"
7. "Campus"
6. "Run"
5. "Diane Young"
4. "Holiday"
3. "Oxford Comma"
Listening to "Oxford Comma" is like opening a book you've never read and immediately enjoying it. It has that indie prep sound that frequents
Vampire Weekend
, yet it's hard to not enjoy the sheer hilarity of the opening line after the laid back guitar intro:
who
gives a fuck
about an oxford comma?
2. "Diplomat's Son"
1. "Ya Hey"
