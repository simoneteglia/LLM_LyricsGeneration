[Verse 1]
Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who’s going to save a little warmth for me
[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train
[Verse 2]
If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who’s going to say a little grace for me?
[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train
[Chorus]
I’m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me
[Verse 3]
See the sun go down, it’s going on down and the night is deep
Want a little light but who’s going to save a little light for me?
[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train
[Chorus]
I’m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me
I’m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me
[Outro]
If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who’s going to say a little grace for me?
