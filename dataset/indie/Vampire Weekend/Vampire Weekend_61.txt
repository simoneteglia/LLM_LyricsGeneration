[Verse 1]
I saw you down at the station
Your leather suitcase burst at the seams
Stay all day up in your rooms now
That's not a problem you've ever seen
[Chorus]
Fall on your knees,
wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls
[Verse 2]
I awoke up in a bedroom
You'd gone out hunting, I was asleep
Spend my day out at the fountain
That's not a problem you had foreseen
[Chorus]
Fall on your knees,
wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls
Fall on your knees,
wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls
[Outro]
Oh, it's no use at all
But that life in the church could still remain
