[Verse 1]
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, lead me to myself
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I was made to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Oh, I was born to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand
[Chorus]
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath a chandelier
That’s going down
[Verse 2]
I thought it over and drew the curtain
Lead me to my cell, lead me to my cell
I hummed the Dies Irae
as you played the Hallelujah
Lead me to my cell, don't leave me in my cell
[Pre-Chorus]
If you’d been made to serve a master
You'd be frightened by the open hand, frightened by the hand
Could I have been made to serve a master?
Well, I’m never gonna understand, never understand
[Chorus]
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
