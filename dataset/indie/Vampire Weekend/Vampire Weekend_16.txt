[Verse 1]
One look sent knees to the ground
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need the pressure to pound
So hold me close, my baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't lie, I want him to know
God's loves die young; is he ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold
[Chorus]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know
[Verse 2]
Young turks
, young Saturday nights
Young hips shouldn't break on the ice
Old flames,
they can't warm you tonight
So keep it cool, my baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't lie, I want him to know
Dial up, three rings and return him his gold
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold
[Chorus]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And everyone I know
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't lie, I want 'em to know
God's loves die young
, are you ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Cause the fire can't last and the winter's cold
[Chorus]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know
