[Verse 1]
We sit in the car
Outside your house
I can feel the heat comin' round
I go to put my arm around you and you
Give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
Well you let out one of your bored sighs and
Lately when I look into your eyes
[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
[Verse 2]
We get dressed up
And we go
Out - baby for the night
We come home early burning -
Burning for some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up, yeah
Setting me up just to knock, knock, knocking me down
[Chorus]
Down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
[Verse 3]
I pull you close, but when we
Kiss - I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out
I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild but
Lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me
[Chorus]
Down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
[Outro]
Oh, darling I'm going down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down,
down
