[Verse 1]
Chestnut vibes on a Saturday night
Mystical boys feelin' alright
Raggedy wisdom falls from my hands
The ladies of Cambridge know who I am
[Chorus]
I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it
[Verse 2]
Graveyard bricks will fall into style
Lady as Pharaoh, Charles as the Nile
That's a museum, price you could pay
Stones of your fathers stand there today
[Chorus]
I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
[Bridge]
'Cause when you left my room to go to the kitchen
I imagined that you were dead
A morbid streak runs through the whole of my family
But for you, I could put it to rest
[Outro]
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take
