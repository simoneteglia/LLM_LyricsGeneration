[Verse 1]
Occident out on the weekend
That's the way that we relax
English Breakfast tastes like Darjeeling
But she's too cute to even ask
[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
[Post-Chorus]
Nastiness will cause your doom
Turn and walk back to your room
[Verse 2]
The precedent's already set now
You spend a week in Old San Juan
Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather
And Spanish waves to roll along
[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
[Post-Chorus]
Majesty's not overheard
Cryptographs can't stand the word
[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, your collegiate grief has left you
Dowdy in sweatshirts, absolute horror
