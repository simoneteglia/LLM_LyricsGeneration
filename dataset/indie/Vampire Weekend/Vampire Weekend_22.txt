[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
Sunflower in the morning
Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know
[Scatting: Steve Lacy]
[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
Sunflower in the evening
Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel
me
Back into the daylight
Let that evil wait
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I donâ€™t know
[Scatting: Steve Lacy]
[Outro: Ezra Koenig]
You know
