[Verse 1]
Gonna take a little time while you're waiting in the factory line
I'll ride across the park, backseat on the 79
Wasted days, you've come to have
[Pre-Chorus]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you've come to have
[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
[Verse 2]
You run up the stairs, see the French kid by the door
Up one more flight, see the Buddha on the second floor
Wasted days you've come to pass
[Pre-Chorus]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have
[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
[Bridge]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awakе to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowtеr
Watch your step along the arch of
[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh
[Outro]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass
