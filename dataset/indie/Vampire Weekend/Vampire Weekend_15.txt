[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
It's not right, but it's now or never
And if I wait, could I ever forgive myself?
On a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide
With the light from the TVs buzzing in the house
[Pre-Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
Dressed in white
with my car keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep wherever I lay my head
And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet
[Pre-Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Bridge: Rostam Batmanglij]
I know, you'll say I'm not doing it right
But this is how I want it
I can't go back to how I felt before
There'sâ€“
[Verse 3: Ezra Koenig]
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend
We found ourselves in bed, when I woke up, he was gone
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro: Ezra Koenig]
Looking out at the ice cold water all around me
I can't feel any traces of that other place
In the dark, when the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car, all black with diplomatic plates
