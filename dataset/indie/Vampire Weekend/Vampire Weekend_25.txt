[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, but that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain, out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white
[Verse 2]
The city was freezing, an elegant floe
The wind at the doorway was unbearably cold
You walked to the bedroom and sat down to write
The page in your notebook was unbearably white
[Chorus]
There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive
[Verse 3]
Sooner or later, the story gets told
To tell it myself would be unbearably bold
Presented with darkness, we turn to the light
Could've been smart, we're just unbearably bright
[Chorus]
There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive
[Bridge]
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
[Verse 4]
Baby, I love you, but that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain
, out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white
[Outro]
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
