[Intro]
Ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy ayy
[Verse 1]
You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and the smart ones sit outside of their sight
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night
Dad was a risk-taker, his was a shoe maker
You, "Greatest Hits 2006" little list-maker
Heard codes in the melodies, you heeded the call
Oh, you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birthright is interest, you could just accrue it all
[Chorus]
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
[Solo Guitar]
[Bridge]
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
[Chorus]
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
[Guitar Solo]
[Instrumental Outro]
