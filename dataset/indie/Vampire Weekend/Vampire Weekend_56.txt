[Verse 1]
It was all a dream
I used to read Thrasher Magazine, looking at pictures of skateboarders
California
So envy me, S.O.S.
L.A.P.D
Docking the yacht in such low waters
Alessandra
[Chorus]
Now it's a different game
80 percent still agree
The winning cause, it pleases God
The losing cause pleases me
[Verse 2]
At the duty-free
Gifts of wine and Hennessy
Beautifully made from such fine water
Robert Smithson
In an ancient scene
Spiral Jetty
, favorite cheese
Leaving the rocks in such blind slaughter
Coliseum
[Chorus]
Now it's a different game
80 percent still agree
The winning cause, it pleases God
But the losing cause pleases me
[Chorus]
Now it's a different game
80 percent still agree
The winning cause, it pleases God
But the losing cause pleases me
