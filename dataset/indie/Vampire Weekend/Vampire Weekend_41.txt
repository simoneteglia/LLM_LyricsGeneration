[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?
[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?
[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?
[Chorus]
Big blue, for once in my life, I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?
