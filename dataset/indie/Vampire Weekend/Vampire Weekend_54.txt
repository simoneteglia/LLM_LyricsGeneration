[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
[Verse 1]
This girl wrote drug raps in baggy sweaters
Tight neon tights, T-shirts and big letters
Back at her house was an Irish setter
With a heart-shaped tag hanging off its collar
Through half the towns of Arizona
I dream the dreams I have when I hold her
Near Palm Springs, we were struck by boulders
'Cause they looked like skull and bones
[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
[Verse 2]
Questions I had as I went through this:
Are our parents actually Buddhist?
Is the pool below me the bluest?
Is the TV on?
Through half the Taquerias y Fondas
Half the health clubs,
half of the saunas
Half the Barbaras, half of the Rhondas
Is there something there?
[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
[Verse 3]
This girl was smarter than television scripts
This girl wasn't damaged, her jeans were just ripped
This girl was the girl that the girls in your world thought about
When the night was cold
How many towns have claimed that they know you?
How many nations think that they own you?
How many simple minds think the same sun
Don't shine on their sunglasses now?
[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
