[Chorus]
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep
[Verse 1]
As this old world keeps turning
Me through my fever dream
Houston just did ninety-nine
Dubai's one-eighteen
[Chorus]
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep
[Verse 2]
I got a wife back home, you know
She always thinks I cheat
I think about those Denton days
When life was light and sweet
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
Every time I think I'm done
The plane keeps flying back
And every race beneath the sun
Just takes another lap
[Chorus]
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep
[Verse 4]
I know the price, I know the map
But don't know what it's worth
So let the thieves and killers
Take my treasure on the Earth
[Outro]
Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep
Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
Now I'm gonna wake up
Where I went to sleep
