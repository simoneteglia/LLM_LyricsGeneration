[Verse 1]
I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too
[Verse 1]
I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too
[Verse 2]
The Argentines collapse in defeat
The admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet
The ground beneath their feet is a nautically mapped sheet
As thin as paper while it slips away from view
