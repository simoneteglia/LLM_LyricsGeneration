[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
No time to discuss it
Can't speak when the waves reach our house upon the dunes
Time cannot be trusted
When the police come, they always come too soon
Life felt like heaven today
Like a foreign car though we are American-made
I thought I'd probably stay
But before I know, I know
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina
[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
No signs of injustice
No signs, but the flames that are filling up the room
Fire cannot be trusted
When the engines come, they always come too soon
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina
[Outro:  Ariel Rechtshaid]
Uh, to an extent, yeah
