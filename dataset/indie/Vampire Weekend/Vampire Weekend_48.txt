[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Darling
[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
Another night indoors, another sign of life-ife
Wobbling up through the floor
You and Kidada
Ooh, I might get low, low, low
But now I'm too high to know
The sound of you and your sister
I couldn't face these days alone
You got the right light, candles burning
We don't need the moon anymore
I used to look for an answer
I used to knock on every door
But you got the wave on, music playing
Don't need to look anymore
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
You and Kidada
Ooh, the lights get low, low, low
And I got nowhere to go
I used to freeze on the dance floor
I watched the icebergs from the shore
But you got the heat on, kettle screaming
Don't need to freeze anymore
Ooh-ooh, darling
I might get
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
[Bridge: Ezra Koenig]
Who knows the reason that
kindness lost its hold
?
Those better angels confined to minor roles
I left the wilding, wilding, wilding days of old
Your house is warmer the wilderness is cold
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
Ooh
Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
Oh, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
[Outro: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim]
Ooh
Things have never been stranger (Ooh)
Things are gonna stay strange (Ooh)
I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I
