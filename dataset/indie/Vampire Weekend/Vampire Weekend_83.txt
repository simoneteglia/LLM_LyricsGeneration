[Verse 1]
Ion displacement won't work in the basement
Especially when I'm not with you
Here in the heartland, a feeling so startling
I don't know what I should do
[Chorus]
Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me
[Verse 2]
Nights by the ocean, a westerly motion
That moves California to sea
Eyes like a seagull, no Kansas-born beetle
Could ever come close to that free
[Chorus]
Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me
