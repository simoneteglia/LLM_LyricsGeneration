[Verse 1]
Everybody sees me, but it's not that easy
Standing in the light field, standing in the light field
Waiting for some action, waiting for some action over
Why won't you come over here?
[Refrain]
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
[Pre-Chorus]
Old time grudges
Will die so slowly
I know you miss the
Way I saw you
[Chorus]
You're cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
[Verse 2]
Nobody can see me, everything is too easy
Standing in the light field, standing in the light field
Waiting for some actress, waiting for some actress to say
"Why won't you come over here?"
[Refrain]
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
[Pre-Chorus]
Old time love song
Will die so swiftly
You never trust me
For a while, it was nice, but it's time to say bye
[Chorus]
I'm cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
No-no-no, cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
Oh no-no-no-no, cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
[Outro]
No, no, you're so cold
