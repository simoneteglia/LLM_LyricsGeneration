[Verse]
I was just sitting there
Time in hand, I will be the one
And it's so easy, darling
Please stay close and I'll be safe
He's all alone outside
And if you try too hard
Then you've gotta let go
I've got it all worked out
And in the end, I'll still be alone
[Bridge]
In your eyes
And it is no big surprise
Sitting here by your side
Opening me
[Verse]
I wanted all of this
And in the end, I'll still be alone
Atop your hills, your face
Cast me down the look in your eyes
And in this big game
You'll be changing just for me
Your screaming says that I'm the one
[Outro]
And looking out, oh
