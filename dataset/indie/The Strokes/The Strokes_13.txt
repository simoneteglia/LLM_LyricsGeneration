[Verse 1]
Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone
Tried to take control
[Refrain]
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
[Verse 2]
We shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame
Says we're all the same
[Refrain]
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
[Pre-Chorus]
Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Tryin' to remind her
When we go back
[Chorus]
I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right thing, but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I watch the TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
The joke is on you,
this place is a zoo
You're right, it's true
[Verse 3]
He says he can't decide
I shake my head to say
"Everything's just great"
[Refrain]
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember
[Pre-Chorus]
Raised in Carolina
She says,
"I'm not like that"
Tryin' to remind her
When we go back
[Chorus]
I say the right thing, but act the wrong way
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
I watch the TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young and they are too old
Oh, man, can't you see, I'm nervous, so please
Pretend to be nice so I can be mean
I missed the last bus, we'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see, it's hard to explain
