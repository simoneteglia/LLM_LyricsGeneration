[Verse 1]
Right, wrong, what to doâ€”someday, it will come to you
Hostile Indians, we named a summer camp for you
[Chorus 1]
I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say, I'm in utter dismay, I've got nothing to say
[Verse 2]
Harmless children, we named our soldiers after you
Don't be a coconut, God is trying to talk to you
We could drag it out, but that's for other bands to do
[Chorus 2]
I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to give, got no reason to live
But I will fight to survive, I've got nothing to hide, wish I wasn't so shy
[Bridge]
I'd like to watch, I'd like to read
I'd like a part, I'd like the lead
[Chorus 2]
But I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say, I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to give, got no reason to live
Oh, I'll kill to survive,
I've got nothing to hide, wish I wasn't so shy
