[Verse 1]
Says he can't decide
I take the kids inside
What does he desire?
[Refrain]
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way
[Verse 2]
Oh, we shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame
I like it when it rains
[Refrain]
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember
[Pre-Chorus]
Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Put the past behind us
I don’t miss them
[Chorus]
I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I try but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right things, but act the wrong way
I like it out here, but I cannot stay
I watch the TV; forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young, and they are too old
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
You're right it's true
[Verse 3]
Says “Are you alright?”
I shake my head to say
Everything’s just great
[Chorus]
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember
[Verse 4]
Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone
Tried to take control
[Refrain]
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember
[Pre-Chorus]
Raised in Carolina, she says
I'm not like that
Put the past behind us
Can we go back
[Chorus]
I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
I try but you see, it's hard to explain
I say the right things but act the wrong way
I like it in here but I cannot stay
I watch the TV, forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young, and they are too old
This place is a zoo, the joke is on you
You're right it's true
