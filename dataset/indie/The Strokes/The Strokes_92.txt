[Intuition]
Why you leaving when the war is within
We got our own fight to fight and I ain't sure that you'll win
I know you can't afford to feel all normal again
But don't go actin all immortal like you're more than a man
I'm only callin cuz I need you to know I care
Already said good bye to three friends that headed over there
Looking back on years we shared with a sober stare
Wishing i'da said don't you dare you know your home is here
Whatever happened to rebellious youth
Whatever happened to public enemy telling the truth
As a kid I was always kinda jealous of you
And that's a pretty fucking gaint elephant in the room
But still I never followed in my dad's footsteps
We know a lot of folks that did and look where that took them
Think it's a bad look friend but do your thing i'll relax
And i'll be here waiting holler when you get back
