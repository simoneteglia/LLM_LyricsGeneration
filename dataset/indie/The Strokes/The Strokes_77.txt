[Verse 1]
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck
Oh these strange manners, I love 'em so
I wish you'd wear your new trench coat
I don't show up on weekdays
And something that you learned yesterday
[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
You ain't got nothing I want, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing
[Verse 2]
I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it don't make sense
I took five dollars, won't get me far
My last resort is to steal your car
Drive you to work and you'll be on time
The little problems they're not yours, they're mine
Come on and listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay
[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't got nothing I want, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing
[Chorus]
And all he said is, "I'm a freak"
He ordered them to make mistakes
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Today, the day that I was born
He won't leave me alone, he keeps asking for more
Together again, like the beginning
But for the record, it's between you and me!
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it don't make sense
Oh, these strange manners, I love 'em so
Why won't you wear your new trenchcoat?
I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, mama running out of luck
Like my sister don't give a fuck
[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to turn you down
And maybe later I'll turn you around
You ain't never had nothing I want, but
I want it all, I just can't figure out
Nothing
[Chorus]
And all he said is, "I'm a freak"
He ordered them to make mistakes
And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Today the day that I was born
He won't leave me alone, he just asks for more
Together again, like the beginning
I said it's between you and I
