[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I'm tired, so lost, so left alone, yeah
Surrounded by the stones I've thrown
Arriving just in time to see the earth destroyed, yeah
I said drag me there, or just take me home
[Chorus]
Oh, reunited, everybody was just here
Oh, I just did this for you, oh
[Verse 2]
Protected by the saints in all 50 states
American minds destined to be great
I'm from around here so I should know, yeah
Blame it on the eskimos
[Chorus]
Yeah, do I look ready?
Forget it, I'm ready
Oh, I'm on my way out of here
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Oh, I'm here, yes
Yeah, come on, you stood on us
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 3]
I'm tired, I'm lost, so left alone, yeah
Surrounded by the stones I've thrown
Arriving just in time to see the earth destroyed, yeah
Drag me there, or just take me home
[Chorus]
Oh, forget it
I'm ready, I'm ready
Oh baby, oh, meet me on the way
[Instrumental Outro]
