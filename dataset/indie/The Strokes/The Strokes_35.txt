[Verse 1]
They found our city under the water
Gotta get my hands on something new
You don't want to be without this
Something isn't adding up
[Pre-Chorus]
Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
'Cause I don't know why
[Chorus]
Someone
Didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow, we don't have to know each other's name
[Verse 2]
They found our city under the water
I began to listen to your eyes
You don't want to live without it
Leaving others in a bind
[Pre-Chorus]
Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
'Cause I don't know why
[Chorus]
Someone
Didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow, we don't have to know each other's name
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Someone
I didn't wanna know their name
Drifting
You don't wanna know what's going down
Even though I really like your place
Somehow, we don't have to know each other's name
[Outro]
Decide my past
Define my life
Don't ask questions
'Cause I don't know why
I don't listen
And I don't speak
Well, it's a talent
But I don't know why
