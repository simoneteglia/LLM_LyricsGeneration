[Verse 1]
So many fish there in the sea
I wanted you, you wanted me
That's just a phase, it's got to pass
I was a train moving too fast
[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't understand what to see
Yeah, then I got a different view
It's you... no
[Chorus]
Wait, I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend, I never was
I said wait, I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend, I never was, no
[Verse 2]
So many fish there in the sea
She wanted him, he wanted me
That's just a phase, it's got to pass
I was a train moving too fast
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know you warned me but this is too important
Now I got a different view
It's you
[Chorus]
Why can't you wait? I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend, I never was
I said wait, I'm not gonna give it a break
I'm not your friend, I never was
