What are we gonna do now?
Taking off his turban, they said, "Is this man a Jew?"
'Cause they're working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying, "We earn more than you"
When we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue eyed man
To be you believers
The judge said five to ten but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall, cause governments to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
Do you know that you can use it?
The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'
It's the best years of your life they want to steal
You grow up and you calm down
You're working for the clampdown
You start wearing blue and brown
And working for the clampdown
So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
Make your first kill now
In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately, one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown
Working for the clampdown
