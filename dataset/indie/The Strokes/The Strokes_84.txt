Can't you see I'm trying, I don't even like it
I just lied to get to your apartment
Now I'm staying here just for a while
I can't think 'cause I'm just way too tired
He gets to me
In the wrong way to see
I want it, and it wants me
So I just crawl, but on my knees
Can't you see I'm trying, I don't even like it
I just lied to stay here for a while
Now I'm trying too hard and I'm falling
So I'll go
