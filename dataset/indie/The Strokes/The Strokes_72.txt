[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Yeah, you don't have to be so loud
Everyone can hear you in this whole damn crowd
Don't have to try so hard
I think they got the message, you were out of your mind
It's not so good to see you this upset
But the next generation will forget
[Chorus]
They're always scared of where their daughters been
Cause who knows, they could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
Is it gone? Gone?
[Verse 2]
Don't have to lick my face
Everyone can see that you're a psycho in
this place
That the next generation will forget
[Bridge]
Where their daughter's been
Or who knows, they could be alone with men
They're never gonna let you understand
Or show you what it is to be a man
You don't wanna sit down and talk and hear
You don't think anyone is in your ear
I never wanna see your face
Accuse - it's no ones fault
[Chorus]
Is it gone?
Gone?
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Gone, gone
They're always scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, they could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
[Outro]
Is it gone?
I hope that, that, that it's gone, gone
I hope that, that, that it's gone
