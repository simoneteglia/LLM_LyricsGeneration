[Verse 1]
I wanna be outrageous
But inside, I know I'm plain
So plain
[Bridge]
Just plain
Boring and plain
[Chorus]
Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Tryin' for the perfect life
End up bein' in denial
[Verse 2]
I wanna be somebody
Wanna be somebody like you
Like you
Like you
[Bridge]
Like you
Instead of me
[Chorus]
Silently obsessed with death
Just like anyone, I guess
Tryin' for the perfect life
End up being in denial
