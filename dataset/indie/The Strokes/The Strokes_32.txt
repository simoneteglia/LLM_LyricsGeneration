[Verse 1]
I think I know what you mean, but watch what you say
'Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way
Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
How do you wake someone up from inside a dream?
Your mind would wander and search for its place in the night
Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born, it followed you 'round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud
[Pre-Chorus]
You're sad but you smile, it's not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change, it's the muscles around your eyes
[Chorus 1]
An egg to fertilize
A pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize
A life to scrutinize
A child to criticize
Young adults to modernize!
Citizens to terrorize
Generations to desensitize
[Verse 2]
Your dreams are sweet and obsessed and you're overworked
You're over taken by visions of being overlooked
How disappointed would D.I.D.I.P.P. be
To see such our power in our hands all wasted on greed?
Am I a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live
As free and detached as boats to the dock?
Just like the music was born and detached from your heart
Is your free time to free minds or for falling apart?
[Pre-Chorus]
Night after night, you turn off the light
You don't fall asleep right away, "Are we, are we done?"
[Chorus 2]
A desk to organize
A product to advertise
A market to monopolize
Movie stars to idolize
Leaders to scandalize
Enemies to neutralize
No time to apologize
Fury to tranquilize!
Weapons to synchronize
Cities to vaporiâ€“
