[Verse 1]
No choice now, it's too late
Let him go, he gave up
I gave up
Lisa said, "Take time for me"
Droppin' him down to his knees
Ah, chest down
[Chorus]
Take me away, see, I've got to explain
Things, they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place?
Oh, "You drink too much" makes me drink just the same
[Verse 2]
People tried, felt so right
Givin' themselves good advice
Lookin' down sometimes felt nice
[Bridge]
He knows it's justified to kill to survive
He then, in dollars, makes more dead than alive
Let's suck more blood, let's run three hours a day
The world is over, but I don't care
[Chorus]
'Cause I am with you, now I've got to explain
Things, they have changed in such a permanent way
Life seems unreal, can we go back to your place?
Oh, "You drink too much" makes me drink just the same, oh!
[Outro]
The first time, it happened too fast
The second time, I thought it would last
We all like it a little different
