[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna say
I've got to say
[Chorus]
We worked hard, darling
We don't have no control
We're under control
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna give it to you, your way
I don't want to know...
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't wanna change the world
I just wanna watch it go by–
I just wanna watch you go by
[Chorus]
We were young, darling
We don’t have no control
We’re out of control
[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna do it your way
I don't wanna give it to you, your way
I don't want to know...
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna know you're alright
I've got to know you're alright
[Chorus]
You are young, darling
For now, but not for long
Under control
