[Verse 1]
Leave me alone, I'm in control
I'm in control
And girls act too much and boys act too tough
Enough is enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, on the minds of other men, I know she was
[Chorus]
I said just take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it, and take it or leave it, oh, take it
[Bridge]
I say, oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends, if he can
He's gonna win someday
[Verse 2]
I fell off the track, now I can't go back
I'm not like that
Boys act too much, girls act too tough
Enough is enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, on the minds of other girls, I know he was
[Chorus]
I said just take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
And take it or leave it, and take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it, and take it or leave it, oh, take it
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Oh, that's right, oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
And gonna break your back for a chance
And gonna steal your friends, if he can
He's gonna win someday, oh, he will
