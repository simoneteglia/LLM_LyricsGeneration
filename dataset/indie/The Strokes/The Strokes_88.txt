[Verse 1]
Take a chance on living on
Except your man, he gave up (He gave up)
When Lisa says, "Time for me"
Bringing you down to his knees, chest down
[Chorus]
Take me away, and this time it can change
Look over there, makes me wish for yourself
Taking your time, wish the hours went slow
You know that's the crutch, that's just what you let go. let go
[Verse 2]
Dream the size, place that there
Come try if the time is right
[Bridge]
He subsides at the side of the place
He's got his own mind and he says that
He doesn't know, but he wants what he has
He'd just pretend that he was always just glad
I'd even notice when he'd walk with your hips
The world is over and I won't quit 'cause
[Chorus]
I am on you, and I know we have tried
Remind me of you, so let's go back to your hive
Walking along, mean's they've seen that I cry
So link us, you and I know that I'll be right here, right here
