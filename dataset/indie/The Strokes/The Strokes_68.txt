[Verse 1]
Whether you're in L.A., sunny laid back L.A
Whether you're in New York, comfort 'round your block
Whether you're in the U.K., where the sky is dark
And the grass is kinda green, you know like Central Park
Still my favorite place in this whole wide world
Has got to be in the middle of the ocean floor
I see you poking out of the ocean, Paradise on Earth
The 50th state - WHAT?!
Hawaii
I wanna live in somewhere different, oh oh oh
A nuclear disaster might be on our way
But I don't care, I'm in the U.S.A
[Verse 2]
Whether we're drunk or stoned or we're sober and old
If I'm with you, I'm a happy man
If you feel safe and cold while you count your gold
If your problem is you can't find your remote control
Still my favorite person in this whole wide world
Is the woman who can understand every word
And when she speaks to me, she makes me
See the whole world as my favorite place...
Hawaii
We got it made, yes, I know
Can we go by plane or boat?
[Verse 3]
Whether you take it slow or you let me go
Whether you tell me something that I did not know
Whether you're neat and polite or you scream and fight
Whether you keep something from me that I would not like
Still my favorite attitude in this world so far
Is the friendly spirit of an iron heart
I like the way folks are in this most special place
I don't care what happens I'm taking a plane
Hawaii, ha-wah-ee
I said, Hawaii, ha-wah-ee
I said, Hawaii, ha-wah-ee
Hawaii, Hawaii, Kauai or Oahu
Molokai or Lanai, Maui and the big guy
A.K.A. Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii, ooh, ooh
All I want to do is something different
Oh, let me in, cut off from Malaysia
Back in who knows when, oh, we got kinda lost
But my God, what a place, I profess
Air Force jets cannot take away my soul
