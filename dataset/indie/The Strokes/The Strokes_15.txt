[Verse 1]
Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names
Racin' against sunbeams
Losin' against fig trees
In your eyes
[Chorus]
And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
See, I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
[Interlude]
Let's go
[Verse 2]
When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
"And I'll be there"
He says, then he walks out
Somehow he was tryin'
Too hard to be like them
[Chorus]
And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
Oh, darling let me go
[Outro]
Tried it once and they liked it
And tried to hide it
Says, "I've been doin' this twenty-five years"
Well, I'm not listenin' no more
And these friends, they keep askin' for more
Oh, yeah, oh, but that's it
