[Intro]
(One, two, three)
[Verse 1]
Get dressed in your bed
While she's asleep
It isn’t right
But it isn’t hard
Tell me, tell me, won’t you understand
Show me, show me, show me a better plan
It’s summer lies
It's someone else's nothing
Here it comes now
[Pre-Chorus]
You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay
But there’s a million reasons to leave
[Chorus]
Find a job
Find a friend
Find a home
Find a dog
Settle down
Out of town
Find a dream
Shut it down
[Verse 2]
Please, please don’t point it that way
It’s just a trigger that goes once and you’ll be unafraid
I wish that I'd been noticed but it never goes that way
The silence that you brought has gone, gone, gone
Tell me, tell me, won’t you understand?
Show me, show me, show me
[Pre-Chorus]
You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay
You asked me to stay
But there’s a million reasons to leave
[Bridge]
Show me what to say
Show me what to be
Show me what to see
Show me what to be
[Chorus]
Find a job
Find a friend
Find a home
Find a dog
Settle down
Out of town
Find a dream
Shut it down
[Outro]
I don’t wanna be in there with you
I don't wanna be in there without your loving either
I waited for your thoughts
Can't wait no longer
