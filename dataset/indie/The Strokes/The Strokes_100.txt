[Verse 1]
Up on a hill, here's where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Start to pretend, stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never-ending
[Pre-Chorus]
In the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you to say no, let me go
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go, oh
[Chorus]
Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
, do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend
I'll pretеnd I'm leaving
[Verse 2]
I feel so different now, wе train at AVA
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
I'm flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
Uh, too many varieties
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, in the sun, sun, having fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now, let me go, ooh, oh
Why, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go on
[Chorus]
Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean, trying to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy
, do it just to please me
Tomorrow it is different, and this is why I'm leaving
