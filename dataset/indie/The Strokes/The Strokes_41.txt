[Verse 1]
When they say promises, they mean promises
They'd say, "That's okay, long as we can celebrate"
[Pre-Chorus]
You see, my uncle would say
Things would change when he's dead
"Meet me in the bathroom",
that's what she said
I don't mind, it's true, hey
[Chorus]
Never was on time, yes, I once was mine
Well, that was long ago and, darling, I don't mind
Yeah, we were just two friends in lust
And, baby, that just don't mean much
Oh yeah, you trained me not to love
After you showed me what it was
[Verse 2]
Now she's staring wide-eyed, I can't close her eyes
(Say what?)
Anywhere is fine, just don't waste my time
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you see, my uncle would say
Things would change once he's dead
"Meet me in the bathroom", that's what she said
I don't mind, it's true
[Chorus]
Never was on time, yes, I once was mine
Well, that was long ago and darling, I don't mind
Yeah, they were just two fucks in lust
Oh, baby, that just don't mean much
Oh yeah, you trained me not to love
After you taught me what it was
