[Verse 1]
Oh, the razorblade, that's what I call love
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it if I put it down
It gets extremely complicated
Anything to forget everything
You've got to take me out at least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms or I'm at your feet
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now, but in your heart it's loud
[Chorus]
"Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry," there you go
[Verse 2]
Oh, the razorblade, wish it would snap this rope
The world is in your hand or it's at your throat
At times it's not that complicated
Anything to forget everything
He would never talk but he was not shy
She was a street-smart girl but she could not lie
They were perfect for each other
Say it now, 'cause in your heart it's loud
[Chorus]
"Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry," hey
[Bridge]
(I loved you
Before I saw you)
[Outro]
Sweetheart, your feelings are more important, of course
Of course
Everyone that wanted everything that we would take from them
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, no, don't, okay
