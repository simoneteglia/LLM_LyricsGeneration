They've stolen all the words
All I have to give
(Was this it?)
Believed in all my lies
Under my good cane
(It's my skin)
Your shepherd there I was
Decided just to give it all
(Instead of)
Days where you don't end
At night we become friends, again
And I lost my way again
(This is, this is a chance)
And I hope you'll never change
This life is on my side
And I am your one
Believe me this is your chance, oh
Surrounded there I was
Decided just to give it all
(For you, girl)
And days like you don't end
At night we become friends, again
And I lost my way again
(This is, this is the chance)
And I hope you'll never change
This life is on my side
'Cause I am your one
(This is, this is for you)
And I lost my way again
