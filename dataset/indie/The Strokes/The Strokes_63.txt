[Verse 1]
They love you or they hate you, but they will never let you be
They'll thrill you or sedate you, but they will never let you see
[Chorus]
In the evening sun
Amber evening sun
[Verse 2]
Encourage and derange you,
watch you walking scared alone
Despite intimidation, pleased to watch you dance alone
[Chorus]
In the evening sun
Amber evening sun
[Bridge]
Go your separate way now
Someday you'll come back
And I'll be dreaming I was sunburned
I don't wanna break your heart in
Break your heart in two halves
Keep one half and give one half to me
I like the summer, miss the summer
Tell me, what'd you do? Nothing? Me, too
[Verse 3]
All actors they're pretending and singers they will sometimes lie
Kids are always honest 'cause they don't think they're ever gonna die
Oh, you're the prettiest, smartest captain of the team
I love you more than being seventeen
[Chorus]
In the evening sun
Amber evening sun
In the evening sun
