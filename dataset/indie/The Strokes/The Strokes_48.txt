[Verse 1]
Now we're out of time
I said it's my fault, it's my fault
Can't make good decisions
It won't stop, I can't stop
[Pre-Chorus]
Give me some time, I just need a little time
Give me some time, I just need a little time
Give me some time, I just need a little time
Give me some time, I just need a little time
[Chorus]
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
It's only the end
It's only the end, hey
[Verse 2]
We don't get the news
He says why not? Why not?
Forget what you heard
'Cause it won't stop, it won't stop
[Pre-Chorus]
Give 'em some time, they just need a little time
Give 'em some time, they just need a little time
Give 'em some time, they just need a little time
Give 'em some time, they just need a little time
[Chorus]
You talk way too much
You talk way too much
It's only the end
It's only the end as you know it
[Outro]
"You're not supposed to say that
You taught me too much"
Is this how it ends?
Is this how it ends?
