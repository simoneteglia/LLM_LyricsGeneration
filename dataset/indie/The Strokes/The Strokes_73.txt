[Verse 1]
Happiness is two different things
What you take and then what you bring
One is pleasure, one's discipline
One's devotion, one's just the ring
[Pre-Chorus]
Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy
[Chorus]
Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart
One has nothing to do with the other
And the world is all cousins not brothers
[Verse 2]
Hard to take you off of my love
One's an instant, one takes some will
One gives life, and one makes you kill
One's the means and one's for the end
[Pre-Chorus]
Desire and reward
Long term and short term joy
[Chorus]
Don't waste your heart
Don't waste your heart
One has nothing to do with the other
And the world is all cousins not brothers
[Outro]
Don't you give in
You're beginning
