[Verse 1]
Unchain me
It's not my midnight yet
Act like a fox, but think like sheep (Wall Street)
Unchain me
Cause this is my bank's advice
We're gonna give it back to you, some other day
[Verse 2]
Unchain me, it's time
I know the way uptown
Unchain me
I'm waiting for the time
Get you with your pajamas on
[Pre-Chorus]
Take off from the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Racing down the highway
Looking at me sideways
[Chorus]
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
[Verse 3]
Unchain me
It's not my midnight yet
Act like a fox but think like a sheep (Wall Street)
Unchain me
Cause this is my best advice
We're gonna give it back to you, some other day
[Pre-Chorus]
Take off of the runway
Thinking of a sad day
Playing with his new toys
Looking at the sad boys
[Chorus]
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
[Bridge]
And we take, what we like from them
And then say, "What do you want from me?"
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge 2]
Don't wait so long
Way too long
They wait too long
I can't stay awake too long
You never wait for some other generation!
I'll wait somewhere alone
Get it in your head
Get out of (my way)
[Chorus]
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
What side you standing on?
[Outro]
Ohhhh [6x]
