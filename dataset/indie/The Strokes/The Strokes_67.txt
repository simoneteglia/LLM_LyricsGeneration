[Verse 1]
Oh, with strangers to impress so near
Old friends don't realize I'm here
I wish two drinks were always in me
I'd pretend I had the perfect ear
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Take me to the water
Make me understand that I was wrong
[Verse 2]
For me, tomorrow is my first day
So please, don't tempt me in the wrong way
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's almost after midnight
I can see the city lights, we're here
[Chorus]
Change your mind tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio
[Verse 3]
Well, I swear I'll give it back tomorrow
But for now I think that I'll just borrow
[Pre-Chorus 3]
All the chords from that song
And all the words from that other song I heard yesterday
[Chorus]
Change your mind, tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio
[Outro]
I will not disturb you
I was just returning you the compliment
