[Intro]
I waited by 'ya
I waited for 'ya
I waited on 'ya
But now I don't
[Verse 1]
You didn't see it
I didn't see it
I didn't see it
But now, oh, I do
I play your game
I play your game, now
I play your game
I play your game
[Chorus]
I take my chances alone
Get on your horse and be gone
I will not wait up for you anymore
So you can ask me if something is wrong
Will you go?
I don't know anymore
[Verse 2]
When the night isn't ready for you
It's a fleeting unorthodox view
They invited a stewardess, too
Now they want you to see it
Here's to days he decides he's got time
And he claims that it's not a surprise
When he finds out the truth's on his side
[Chorus]
I take my chances alone
Get on your horse and be gone
I will not wait up for you anymore
So you can ask me if something is wrong
Will you go?
I don't know anymore
I don't believe anyone
As they crawl out of my way
[Outro]
Waiting for the night
Leaving night by night
You can see me travel
We could be in trouble every night
We're having a new life
