[Verse 1]
Those that try anything once
Should we care about the only ones?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the time that I need is never quite enough
All the time that I have is all that’s necessary
[Chorus]
You're livin' a lie, you're livin' a lie
You're livin' too fast, you gotta pray for the best
You never ask why, you never ask why
You're livin' a lie,
baby, you're flying too high
[Verse 2]
No one talks about the war
On my block or by the shore
[Pre-Chorus 2]
All alone in a room, do you want what I want, too?
All the time in the world is all that's necessary
[Chorus]
You're livin' a lie, you're livin' a lie
You're livin' too fast, you gotta pray for the best
You never ask why, you never ask why
You're livin' a lie,
baby, you're flying too high
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You never ask why, you never ask why
You're livin' a lie,
baby, you're flying too high
Don’t get on the phone, don’t reach for the door
You know the answer that you’re looking for
You’re livin’ a lie, you’re livin’ a lie
You’re livin’ too fast, you gotta pray for the best
You never ask why, you never ask why
You’re livin’ a lie,
baby, you’re flying too high
