[Verse 1]
One by one, ticking time bombs won
It's not the secrets of the government that's keeping you dumb
Oh, it's the other way around
â€” wait, what's that sound?
One by one, baby, here they come
He wants it easy, he want it relaxed
Said I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that
Two steps forward then three steps back, alright
[Pre-Chorus]
"Won't you take a walk outside?" Oh no
"Can't you find some other guy?" Oh no
"One-nine-six-nine, what's that sound?" Oh no
Keeping down the underground, oh no
[Chorus]
The end has no end, the end has no end
The end has no end, the end has no end
[Verse 2]
He want it easy, he want it relaxed
Said I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that
Two steps forward then three steps back
It won't be easy
[Pre-Chorus]
"Won't you take a walk outside?" Oh no
"Can't you find another guy?" Oh no
"One-nine-six-three, what's that sound?" Oh no
Keeping down the underground, oh no
[Chorus]
The end has no end, the end has no end
The end has no end, the end has no end
The end has no end, the end has no end
The end has no end, the end has no end
