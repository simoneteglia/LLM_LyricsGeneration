[Verse 1]
80's people dancing, oooh
Always get it right
I'd listen but I can't tonight
I can't tonight, I can't tonight
Well, it's something that you do to get it right
End up reviled for it
Yeah, that's the thanks I get
[Chorus]
I don't understand
Your fucked-up system
This sinister city
Try to sell the water
Try to sell the air
Try to sell your daughter
Try to sell her hair
Verse:
[Bridge 1]
'We all want to watch the fight'
'Is it on Sunday?'
Hide in a hole with a gun in your hand in front of
Someone you want dead, I guess?
Hiding in your suit...
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
I did not know that
They're bringing me back to my past
I got my head in my hands
I got my head in my—
I got my head in my hands
I got my head in my—
I got my head—
It's just something that you do to get it right
End up reviled for it
Yeah, that's the thanks I get
[Chorus]
Jail, that's what you get
Stepping to the system
Profiting from war
Fighting as the victim
Always wanting more
Trying to trick your brothers
Get them to fight it for you
[Bridge 2]
I cannot believe my eyes
Darling I can tell you lies
"Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago"
I don't know geography all that well
Yeahhh
[Outro]
Defying Western logic
Even if it shows you're wrong
I guess that's a classic
Been with us all along
