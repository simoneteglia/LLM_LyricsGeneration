[Verse 1]
With all the noise above
He tried to call his name
The trial would go on
The day has just begun
[Chorus]
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
[Verse 2]
The diamond cuts her eye
The crowd behind went wild
They weren't all that proud
By now, they hear it loud
[Chorus]
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
Living in an empty world
[Outro]
I'm okay
I'm alright
I was out late last night
Empty love
Empty love
I will wait one more night
