[Verse 1]
You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before, I know
And sold you on their way
Oh, honey, that's okay
[Refrain]
No harm, he's armed
Settin' off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap
[Verse 2]
And store fronts rarely change
At least I'm on my own again, instead of
Anywhere with you
Oh, tell me it's all the same
[Chorus]
And I lost my page again
I know this is surreal, but I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side, oh, I am your one
Believe me, this is a chance, oh, oh
[Verse 3]
Let's see what is for sale
He's tryin' not to give his job a chance
Oh, it's never gonna be
It's sad, but I agree
The signal don't seem right
It lasts for just one night and then
I'm sorry that I said
That we were just good friends
[Refrain]
No harm, he's armed
Settin' off all your alarms
Entranced, I can't
Be here, in time I'll think about that
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
And I lost my page again
I know this is surreal, but I'll try my luck with you
Oh, this life is on my side, oh, I am your one
Believe me, oh, this is a chance, oh, oh
