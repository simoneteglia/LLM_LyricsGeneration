[Verse 1]
Oh b-baby, don't you be so mad because I barely remember
And she tries to recognize me with the eyes
She saw me with in December
And she's starting to realize that it's actually not a good thing
And it's so tough because you're down to go out again and have another adventure
All her friends in the alleyway shout back but she can't hear them
[Chorus 1]
But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
Get up in the morning and run
You'll be frustrated 'til the day that you're done
[Verse 2]
He got punched in the mouth for sticking
His nose in other people's business
No good solution, always on the verge of some revolution
Well tough luck, it may take a thousand years
But I think we can do it
Best friends fight but they never enjoy life
As good as when they abuse it
He said "The soldier is a necessity in light of all the failures of man"
[Chorus 2]
But you're never gonna get their love
We can only fight in the sand
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone
He could never mention it out here and now
Without quick tears in his eyes
[Chorus 3]
But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone
[Chorus 4]
Oh you're never gonna get this love
We can roll around in the dark
That's about as far as we go
Get up in the morning and run
