[Verse 1]
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation that has nothing to say
How'd you make your way to me?
[Chorus 1]
Oh, let's say you made a deal with me
And I got your name and your home address
Oh, you're all trashed up with your big red belt
I would almost say that you might need help
I could drop you off at the next red light
If it don't make sense or it don't feel right
All the girls could never make me love them the way I love you
[Verse 2]
Can't you see the sky is not the limit no more?
I can see the elevator crash through the floor
I can still see yesterday, sailing away
Seven billion people
who got nothing to say
Are you coming on to me?
[Chorus 2]
Well, I saw your face, then I heard that song
It was so inviting, it hurt my bones
Well, it looks like you but your eyes are gray
And your hair is gone but your mind's okay
Yes, I like your smile but your forehead's cold
I don't want you to be afraid and go
I would cheat and lie and steal, now I'll stay at home and kneel for you
[Bridge]
I was waiting for my baby to arrive
Right by my side
Oh, please, leave me alone tonight
Forget the past
[Verse 3]
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Oh, you know I said it just to get you to laugh
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation of entertainers to blame
The light is red, the camera's on
[Outro]
Get yourself a lawyer and a gun
Hate your friend's new friends like everyone
Childhood's end can be so competitive
Oh, the sky's not the limit and you're never gonna guess what is, oh
