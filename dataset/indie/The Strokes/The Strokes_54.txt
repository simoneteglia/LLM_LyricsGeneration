[Verse]
Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks, my friend, thought it was too late"
Oh, why, oh, why? I don't know
So you think things move pretty fast down here?
Well, just wait, my dear, 'til you look up there
Oh, maybe some day you'll know
Had his second kid, was an early night
Gotta be well dressed 'cause he hates to fly
Oh, loves his job, takes it home
[Chorus 1]
Anything they wanted, they could
Have it, have it
Didn't even notice, I don't
Mind it, mind it
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse]
Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks, my friend, thought that we was dead"
Oh, why, oh, why? I don't know
Think things move pretty fast down here?
But just wait, my dear, 'til we get up there
Oh, maybe some day they'll know
[Chorus 2]
Come on, tell me, does he warm the
Room when he comes?
Or does he just know how to leave
When it gets cold?
[Outro]
I don't care
I don't care 'cause it's free
