[Verse 1]
Up on a hill, here's where we begin
This little story, a long time ago
Start to pretend, stop pretendin'
It seems this game is simply never-endin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in the sun, sun, havin' fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now,
let me go
Oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go
[Chorus]
Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rollin' in the ocean, tryin' to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy,
do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so I'll pretend I'm leaving
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
I feel so different now, we trained at A-V-A
I wish you hadn't stayed, my vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid
Flyin' overseas, no time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, in the sun, sun, havin' fun, it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now,
let me go, woo!
Darling, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-g-go
[Chorus]
Leaving just in time, stay there for a while
Rollin' in the ocean, tryin' to catch her eye
Work hard and say it's easy,
do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different, so this is why I'm leavin'
