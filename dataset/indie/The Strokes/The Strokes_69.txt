[Verse 1]
Say a prayer now, don't be scared now
You don't want trouble, well, we might get some
We might get some, it's troublesome
But don't you worry, you can help me
[Chorus]
Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies
[Verse 2]
First you're worried, then you're hurried
Don't think that everything is gonna stay the same, that's impossible
Before I let you go, let me look at you
Don't you worry, you will help me
[Chorus]
Killing lies, killing lies
Killing lies, killing lies
[Outro]
Oh yes, I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
Oh yes, I noticed you, you are a friend of mine
You're mine
