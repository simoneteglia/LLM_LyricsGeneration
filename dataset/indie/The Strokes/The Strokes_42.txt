[Verse 1]
You don't have to be so loud
Everyone can hear you in this whole damn crowd
You don't have to try so hard
I think they got the message, you were out of your mind
It's not so good to see you this upset
But the next generation will forget
[Pre-Chorus]
They're always scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, she could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
[Chorus]
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
[Verse 2]
Oh, please don't try to lick my face
Everyone can see that you're a psycho in this place
The next generation will forget
[Bridge]
Where their daughter's been
Or who knows, you could be alone with men
They're never gonna let you understand
Or show you what is to be a man
You don't wanna sit down and think or hear
You don't think anyone is in your ear
I never wanna see your face
Accuse - it's no ones fault
[Chorus]
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
They're always scared of where their daughter's been
Cause who knows, she could be alone with men
They never wanna see or hear or think about again
[Chorus]
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
Is it gone?
I hope that nothin's wrong
