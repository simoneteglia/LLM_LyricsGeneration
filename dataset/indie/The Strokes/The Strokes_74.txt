[Verse 1]
Tell me what happened, tell me what happened
Tell me what happened if you like
Get off on the same floor, get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor every night
[Verse 2]
What are the reasons? What are the reasons?
What are the reasons to find more?
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you nothing more
[Chorus]
In my mind, gave a hand
Never once, gave a damn
[Verse 3]
I'm done with the office, I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office, hello, forest
I still want to ask you, I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you something more
[Chorus]
In my mind, gave a hand
Never once, gave a damn
[Bridge]
I don't want to fight, don't want to beg, you any-
I don't want to fight, don't want to beg, you any-
I don't want to fight, don't want to beg, you anymore
[Outro]
I don't wanna argue, I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue, you think you won
I wouldn't hurt you, I wouldn't hurt you
Well, maybe I'd hurt you, If I could
