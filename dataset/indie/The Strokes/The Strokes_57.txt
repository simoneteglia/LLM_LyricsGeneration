[Verse 1]
That was you up on the mountain
All alone and all surrounded
Walking on the ground you're breaking
Laughing at the life you're wasting
One, two tries won't do it
You do it all your life and you never get through it
Everything they had to say
Had been erased in just one day
[Chorus 1]
"Good try, we don't like it"
"Good try, we won't take that shit"
Oh, I can't win
[Verse 2]
Things in bars that people do
When no one wants to talk to you
Failing can be quite a breeze
He told me that these girls were easy
Happy that you said you'd mount me
Felt unlucky when you found me
Some nights come up empty handed
Yes, I'll take it
[Chorus 2]
Wait now, by the sidewalk
Hold on, yes, I'll be right back
Oh, I can't win
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus 3]
Yeah, I wait for something
"Cool it, we won't take that shit"
"Good try, we don't like it"
Hold on, yes, I'll be right back
