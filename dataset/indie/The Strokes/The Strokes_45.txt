[Verse 1]
Say it all
Just get it all off your chest
Shake it up
500,000 times
Say no more
We don't believe anything
Teenage angst
Come all ages
[Chorus]
Baby, show me where to go
Some things I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
Out all the time
[Verse 2]
Say it all
I'm not awake anymore
Change my mind
2,000 times before
Seen a knight
Dance on the side of the road
Teenage angst
Come all ages
[Chorus]
Baby, show me where to go
Some things I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
Out all the time
[Bridge]
Feeling dizzy now
In the running show
All I want to see
All I want to know
Watch you as you stay
Faces at your door
Waiting for your piece
Pull the trigger please
[Chorus]
Baby, show me where to go
Somethings I don't wanna know
Baby, tell me if you're sure
Out all the time
Cause I don't wanna see everybody get together
Leave these dreams alone
You don't wanna have to tell me that I wanted you go
Everybody needs a shadow, oh
