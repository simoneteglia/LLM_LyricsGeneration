[Intro]
Okay, I see how it is now
You don't have time to play with me anymore
That’s how it goes, I guess
Fuck the rest
Be right there, honey!
[Verse 1]
I’m gonna take my time to say
Take my time today
I’m gonna take what comes my way
Take what they give me
Yeah, I want my money now
But he is not around
You better hold my money safe
What's your emergency?
[Chorus]
And for the first time in my life
I’m gonna get myself right
Just get into trouble
Be there on the double
[Verse 2]
Place your bets this time
Just has to let it ride
I tr- I tried to take a roll
But the dice are on parole
I won't look down your dress
I bet you bend down as a test
I cannot wait to chase it all
Yeah, I saw it in my crystal ball
[Bridge]
Friday night is shining like
A secret for a spy
I got a better idea
I'll bet you on the side
When I get up in your face
You know it’s no surprise
Ah baby, why's it so hard to read the sentence in my eyes?
[Chorus 2]
And for the first time
Chains on your legs
I spent a while
Then decided on you
My baby doll
You ignored your life
We’ll do it together
I’ll be there whenever
[Verse 3]
Oh, you took a minute break
And said, "thumbs up, they’re okay."
I’m going to watch the tidal wave
It’s hard to chase away
[Outro]
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
(Got to chase away)
(Hard to chase away)
(It’s hard to chase away)
