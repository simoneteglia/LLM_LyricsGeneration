[Verse 1]
Watched her as she wiped her eyes
You don't make me sorry
Now I know that you never listened – listen
Thinking about that high school dance
Worrying about the finals
Yes I know, you're feeling lonely
Oh lonely, so lonely
[Pre-Chorus]
Never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, I never needed nobody
Don't worry about it, honey
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, it won't change now
[Chorus]
Am I wrong?
Don't sing along with me
I said I was fine
It's just the second time we lost the war
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2]
She'd be in the kitchen,
I would start the fire
Oh, those days are gone
But you know I can't give up – give up
P.S. If I may ask why, when will they get tired?
We've stayed up all night trying – trying
[Pre-Chorus]
Never needed anybody, I never needed nobody
I never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
Don't worry about it, honey
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, it won't change now
[Chorus]
Am I wrong?
Don't sing along with me
I said I was fine
The second time we lost the war
I guess it's the end
