[Verse 1]
P.S if I may ask why, when will they be tired?
We stayed up all night trying â€“ trying
I see them and they see me
Why weren't they inspired?
Yes I know that maybe we don't
Listen, listen
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
Oh, don't worry bout it honey
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody
[Chorus]
He's lying I say dreams gets hard
And God sent them tossed
Cause when the wrong girl gets lost
Give them their thoughts
(delicous little guitar solo, By Al)
[Verse 3]
Thinkin' bout their high school dance
Worried about the final
Yes I know, that maybe we won't
Give up, give up
Stop!
Talkin' in their trends of old
Yes I start the fire
Whoa oh oh
Oh baby, we won't
Listen, listen
[Pre-Chorus]
I never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
I don't worry about it honey
I never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
[Chorus]
He's lying I say dreams decide
And give them a chance
Cause when the old men gets gone
Girls try too hard
This is the night
