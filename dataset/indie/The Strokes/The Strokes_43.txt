[Verse 1]
It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by
I've tried too hard
To get back there
But, youâ€™re not on time
Anymore
Tried to get in with you
For a second time
You said the world's closed in
But you crawled in
Back inside
[Chorus]
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
[Verse 2]
I tried to believe in fate
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds
For the night
[Chorus]
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
So please
Run away
Run away
