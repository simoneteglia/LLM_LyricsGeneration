[Verse 1]
I'm tired of everyone
I know
Of everyone I see
On the street and on TV, yeah
[Chorus]
On the other side, on the other side
Nobody's waiting for me on the other side
[Verse 2]
I hate them all, I hate them all
I hate myself for hating them
So I'll drink some more, I love them all
I'll drink even more, I'll hate them even more than I did before
[Chorus]
On the other side, on the other side
Nobody's waiting for me on the other side
[Bridge]
I remember when you came
You taught me how to sing
Now, it seems so far away
You taught me how to sing
[Verse 3]
I'm tired of being
So judgmental of everyone
I will not go to sleep, I will train my eyes to see
That my mind is as blind as a branch on a tree
[Outro]
On the other side, on the other side
I know what's waiting for me on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
I know you're waiting for me on the other side
