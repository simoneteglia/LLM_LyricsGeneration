[Intro]
Ow! Haha, I meant, ah!
Haha, no, I didn't mean that at all
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Here in the streets
so mechanized
Rise to the bottom of the meaning of life
Studied all the rules and didn't want no part
But I let you in just to break this heart
Even though it was only one night
It was fucking strange
[Pre-Chorus]
Nina's in the bedroom, she said, "Time to go now"
But leavin' it ain't easy, I got to let go, oh, I got to let go
And the hours, they ran slow
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying
[Chorus]
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart
[Verse 2]
Well, kill me now 'cause I let you down
I swear one day I'm gonna leave this town
Stop
Yes, I'm leaving, 'cause it just won't work
And they act like Romans, but they dress like Turks
Some time in your prime, see me, I like the summertime but, hey
[Pre-Chorus]
Nina's in the bedroom, she said, "Time to go now"
But leaving, it ain't easy, oh, I got to let go, oh, I got to let go, oh
Trapped in an apartment, she would not let them get her
She wrote it in a letter, I got to come clean
The authorities they've seen, darling,
I'm somewhere in between
I said, every night, she just can't stop saying
[Chorus]
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart
New York City cops, New York City cops
New York City cops, but they ain't too smart
