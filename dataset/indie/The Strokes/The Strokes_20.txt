[Verse 1]
Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you
[Chorus 1]
And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?
[Chorus 2]
And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go that way
I'll wait for you
[Chorus 3]
I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning yelling, "No more!"
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll be waiting for you
