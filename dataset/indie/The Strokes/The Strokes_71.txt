[Verse 1]
How did anybody find out where I was?
How did anybody find that out?
I was hiding from the world, I was a squirrel
But you chopped down my tree to get my fur
[Pre-Chorus]
Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, the fear of sleep
Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, fear of sleep
Oh, fear of sleep, can't you wait? I'm not done
Fear of sleep, here you come
Fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep
[Chorus]
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
[Verse 2]
I guess everybody's week must have been pretty rough
'Cause everybody is drunk, loud and pissed off
I know you hate to be impressed with someone else, other than yourself
But you know, trying to hold back on being an asshole helps
[Pre-Chorus]
Fear of sleep, fear of sleep, fear of sleep
Fear of sleep, where'd you go? Fear of sleep
Oh, fear of sleep, so you know, I'm not done
Here we go, here you come
Fall asleep, fall asleep, fall asleep
[Chorus]
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun, you're no fun
You're no fun, you're no fun
