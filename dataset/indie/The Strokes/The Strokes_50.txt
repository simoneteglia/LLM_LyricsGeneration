[Verse 1]
Sister, it feels like just yesterday
Sister,
don't you forget my number
On this door
You've got something and it's so good to see
Something wonderful that I could not be
Everybody hanging on for their lives
But you can't help them cause you don't have the time
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know everyone goes any damn place they like
I hope this goes over well on the toxic radio, yeah
[Chorus]
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh, that's not the problem
And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend
You get taken for a fool all the time
I don't know why
[Verse 2]
Blame yourself for once, quit putting it on me
I can't help you cause I've seen what it means
It's so early,
I don't want to wake up
Oh, we're so lucky cause we never grow up
Mama, it feels like just yesterday
Mama, don't you forget my number
I don't want to be the one at the door
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know, everyone goes any damn place they choose
And I hope everyone well on the toxic radio
A tourist in the ghetto, not afraid of anything
Except death and anything else that could maybe hurt them, oh yeah
[Chorus]
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh, that's not the problem
And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday, Tuesday is my weekend
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
[Coda]
You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
I don't know why
