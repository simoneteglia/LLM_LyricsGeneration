[Verse 1]
Talk to me now I'm older
Your friend told you 'cause I told her
Friday nights have been lonely
Change your plans and then phone me
[Verse 2]
We could go and get
forties
Fuck going to that party
Oh really, your folks are away now?
Alright, let's go, you convinced me
[Chorus]
12:51 is the time my voice
Found the words I sought
Is it this stage I want?
The world is shutting out for us
Oh, we were tense for sure
But we was confident
[Verse 3]
Kiss me now that I'm older
I won't try to control you
Friday nights have been lonely
Take it slow but don't warn me
[Outro]
We'd go out and get forties
Then we'd go to some party
Oh, really, your folks are away now?
Alright, I'm coming, I'll be right there
