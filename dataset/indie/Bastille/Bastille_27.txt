[Verse 1]
Four in the morning, we find ourselves here
The best of us passed out, I don't know who's where
I got all my old friends and new friends I've met once before
In a blanket of smoke as we sink through the floor
[Pre-Chorus]
Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar
[Chorus]
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh, ah
[Verse 2]
Time skips, balloon hits, I'm losing my mind
Tuesday'll be a doom day, this got out of hand
[Pre-Chorus]
Here, here, my family
You are my familiar, you are my familiar
Here, here, my friends and me
You are my familiar
[Chorus]
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
No, there is nowhere I would rather be, oh-oh
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh, ah
[Bridge]
I don't care if we're talkin' 'bout the same things
I don't care if we're stuck in the familiar
I don't care if we're goin' 'round in circles
Again, again, again
[Pre-Chorus]
Here, here, my family (I might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar, you are my familiar (Not much more that I would ask for)
Here, here, my friends and me (I might be a walking disaster)
You are my familiar (Not much more that I would ask for)
[Chorus]
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
Never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when I'm here
Oh, there is nowhere I would rather be
I never feel more comfortable, could never want for more when you're near
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
[Outro]
I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, I can't remember
I can't remember, help me piece it all together, darlin'
