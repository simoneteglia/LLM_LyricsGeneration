[Verse 1]
Love me, leave me
Rhythm of the evening, chasing a good time
London's burning
If the world is ending, let's stay up all night
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
Yeah, we lost track of time
You always let me down so tenderly
So live fast and die young and stay forever numb
[Chorus]
You said that maybe this is where it ends
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
[Post-Chorus]
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
[Verse 2]
I'm here feeling lower than the sterling
How'd you look so good?
Groundhog evening, dancing on the ceiling
Kubrick's Hollywood
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
Yeah, we lost track of time
[Chorus]
You said that maybe this is where it ends
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
[Post-Chorus]
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
[Bridge]
Now we find ourselves lying around here
Always find ourselves lying around here
Down here
(And we make the same mistakes)
(Till the morning breaks)
Ooh
(And we make the same mistakes)
(Till the morning breaks)
[Chorus]
You said that maybe this is where it ends
(Maybe this is where it ends)
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
And if we're going down in flames
Take a bow for the bad decisions that we made
Bad decisions that we made
[Post-Chorus]
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks (Ooh)
So we'll make the same mistakes
Till the morning breaks
[Outro]
Do you remember what you said to me?
'Cause we lost track of time
Yeah, we lost track of time
