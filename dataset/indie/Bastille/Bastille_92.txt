[Intro: Craig David &
Kianja
]
Yeah, would I lie to you baby?
Yeah, would I?
No, no, no
Yeah, would I lie to you baby?
Yeah, would I lie?
Darling
(Oh yeah)
Yeah, would I lie to you baby?
Yeah, would I lie to you girl?
Would I lie to you baby?
Yeah, would I lie to you, lie to you?
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?
[Verse 1: Kianja,
Dan Smith & Kianja
]
Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
Now it's open, I can't do no more
I'm telling you baby you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby?
Would I lie?
[Verse 2: Dan Smith,
Dan Smith & Kianja
]
Everybody's got their history
On every page, a mystery
You can read my diary, you're in every line
A jealous mind, never satisfied (Oh, yeah)
But
I'm telling you baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine
[Chorus: Dan Smith & Kianja]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Yeah)
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Yeah)
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Yeah)
[Verse 3: Dan Smith,
Kianja
]
Would I lie to you?
I wanna see you night and day
Would I lie?
Tell you about it if you'd stay
Would I lie to you baby?
Think I'll give my love away
Would I lie?
It's not the kind of game I play
[Bridge: Dan Smith & Kianja,
Kianja
]
I'm telling you baby you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine
Deep in my heart baby
[Verse 4: Dan Smith]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby? Would I lie?
[Outro: Craig David]
Would I lie? Would I lie? Would I lie?
Would I lie? Would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Would I lie? Would I lie? Would I lie?
Would I lie? Would I lie to you?
Would I lie? Would I lie? Would I lie?
Would I lie? Would I lie to you?
