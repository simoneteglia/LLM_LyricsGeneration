[Verse 1]
Moving along at a pace unknown to man
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go-oh-oh
Go, go, go, go, go-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
And you thought the lions were bad
Well, they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died
Oh, they would crown another
And it's harder than you think
Telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad
Well, they tried to kill my brothers
[Chorus]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
[Verse 2]
Dreaming along at a pace you'll understand
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go-oh-oh
No, no, no, no, no-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
And you thought the lions were bad
Well, they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died
Oh, they would crown another
And it's harder than you think
Telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad
Well, they tried to kill my brothers
[Chorus]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
[Bridge]
Oh, to see what it means to be free
Of the shackles and the dream that you claim to see
[Chorus]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
They will come for you
[Outro]
And felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Felled in the night by the ones you think you love
Love
