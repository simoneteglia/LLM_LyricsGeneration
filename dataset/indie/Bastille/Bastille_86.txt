[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
And now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby, I'm grieving
But if you wanna leave then take good care
I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by, just upon a smile, girl
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you, just like a child, girl
[Verse 2: Dan Smith]
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you sad, girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you wanna leave then take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh
[Chorus: Dan Smith & Kianja]
Ooh baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by, just upon a smile, girl
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you, just like a child, girl (Child, girl)
[Outro: Dan Smith & Kianja]
I'll always remember you, just like a child, girl
