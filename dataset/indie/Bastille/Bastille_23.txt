[Verse 1]
I am bound to you with a tie that we cannot break
With a night that we can't replace
I'm lost but found with you in a bed that we'll never make
It's a feeling we always chase
[Pre-Chorus]
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real
[Chorus]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, in another time
And in another place
[Verse 2]
So lie to me tonight and pretend till the morning light
And imagine that you are mine
'Cause when the sun'll rise with the truth coming out your eyes
We'll be good in another life
[Pre-Chorus]
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real
[Chorus]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
[Bridge]
It felt like something special but it never felt like love
Wonder what we could be living in another life
Catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love
Then you stop me talking as you kiss me from above
[Chorus]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
[Outro]
Oh, yeah
In another time
And in another place
