[Verse 1]
Staring down the barrel of a hundred tonnes
(
We're riding the wave
)
It might be getting older, but the night's still young
(
We're riding the wave
)
We never, never give up on a lost boy life
(
We're riding the wave
)
So here we are, escaping from the world outside
(
We're riding the wave
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what would your mother say if she could see what we're doing now?
Oh, what would your mother say if she could hear what we talk about?
[Chorus]
The waves are crashing down on you and me
Again, again, again
The waves are crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side (Hey)
Get carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught up in, caught up in the waves
(
We're riding the wave
)
[Verse 2]
Suddenly we're fallin' through the twilight zone
(
We're riding the wave
)
Watch the party playing out in slow motion
(
We're riding the wave
)
So tie a ribbon 'round my arm and throw me in
(
We're riding the wave
)
Is it an apocalypse or nihilism on your lips? We sink or swim
(
We're riding the wave
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what would your mother say if she could see what we're doing now?
Oh, what would your mother say if she could hear what we talk about
(Hey)
[Chorus]
The waves are crashing down on you and me
Again, again, again
The waves are crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side (Hey)
Get carried, get carried away, oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught up in, caught up in the waves
(
We're riding the wave
)
[Bridge]
The air hit me on the way out
Did it make me more sober or make me more drunk?
I couldn't quite remember
The vision of you and of me
The air hit me on the way out
Did it make me more sober or make me more drunk?
I couldn't quite remember
The vision of you and of me
[Chorus]
The waves are crashing down on you and me
Again, again, again
The waves are crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side (Hey)
Get carried, get carried away-ay-ay-ay-ay
Caught up in, caught up in the wa-a-a-a-aves
[Outro]
(The waves)
They're crashing down, they're crashing down, oh-oh
(The waves)
They're crashing down on you and me
I'll see you on the other side
(
We're riding the wave
)
(Hey)
