[Excerpt]
"We are the music-makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams."
[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
Now there you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play it the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness
[Verse 2: Gabrielle Aplin,
Dan Smith
]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
What you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost
[Chorus: Gabrielle Aplin]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know, you'll know
[Verse 3: Gabrielle Aplin]
Now here I go again I see a crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
[Verse 2: Gabrielle Aplin & Dan Smith,
Gabrielle Aplin
]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering
What you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
[Bridge: Dan Smith]
All we had and all we lost
All we had and all we lost
[Chorus: Gabrielle Aplin & Dan Smith,
Dan Smith
]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know, you'll know
(
All we had and all we lost
)
You'll know, you'll know
(
All we had and all we lost
)
You'll know, you'll know
(
All we had and all we lost
)
