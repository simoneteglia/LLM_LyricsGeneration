[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
I came here for sanctuary
Away from the winds and the sounds of the city
I came here to get some peace
Way down deep where the shadows are heavy
I can't help but think of you
In these four walls my thoughts seem to wander
To some distant century
When everyone we know is six feet under
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith]
When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me
For all to see
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
When our lives are over
And all that remains
Are our skulls and bones, let's
Take it to the grave
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands
All that remains
[Verse 2: Rag'n'Bone Man]
I don't want to rest in peace
We can haunt each other's dreams
We'll fight underneath this turf
And bicker away in darkness
We'll find our way to resolve
Our banes from the land of the living
We'll find a common ground
And fall in love all over again
[Pre-Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me
For all to see
[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man]
When our lives are over
And all that remains
Are our skulls and bones, let's
Take it to the grave
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands
All that remains
[Bridge: Skin from Skunk Anansie]
From dusk to dawn, my unheard screams
Grow silent in defeat
I know you're just a memory
But you used to taste so sweet
As you fade away, I realize
It's all over
And nothing stays the same
The skull and bones remain
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith]
When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side, it's always been just you and me
For all, all to see
[Chorus: Skin,
with Dan Smith
& Rag'n'Bone Man
]
When our lives are over
And all that remains
Are our skulls and bones, let's
Take it to the grave
Hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands
All that remains
