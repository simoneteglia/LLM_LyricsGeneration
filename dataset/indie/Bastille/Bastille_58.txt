[Verse 1]
I, I'm lost in my head again
Time travellin', runnin' a—, runnin' away
With darkness, my only friend
Don't wanna do this all again
You pull me back down to earth
Clothes off, your hands are on, hands are on me
Graceland-in'
onto your bed, there you are
[Pre-Chorus]
In my head, there's a beat
It's the beat that you make when you're movin' your body
You prove that I can't escape
I can't escape
Got my heart in your hands
And your hands on my chest
In my chest, there's a breath
It's the breath that you take away
[Chorus]
And you said, "Shut off the lights, we don't need them to dancе"
Hey, oh-oh, you said, "Just shut off the lights, we don't need thеm to dance"
Oh-oh, oh, you said, "Just shut off the lights, shut off the lights"
[Verse 2]
We're drunk, we're invincible
No going quietly into the night
This room is our universe
You are my gravity tonight
No talk of the future now
Dark thoughts, you're shakin' 'em, takin' 'em out
This rhythm that we create sets me straight
[Pre-Chorus]
In my head, there's a beat
It's the beat that you make when you're movin' your body
You prove that I can't escape
I can't escape
Got my heart in your hands
And your hands on my chest
In my chest, there's a breath
It's the breath that you take away
[Chorus]
And you said, "Shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance"
Hey, oh-oh, you said, "Just shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance"
Oh, oh-oh, you said, "Just shut off the lights, shut off the lights"
[Post-Chorus]
Last night, you said, "Empty your head, be here with me
Shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance
Tune out the noise dor a moment"
You said, "Let's just shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance"
[Bridge]
Mmh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh
Oh-oh, you said, "Just shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance"
Mmh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh
(Oh, no, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't, no, we don't) Oh-oh, you said, "Just shut off the lights, oh"
"Shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance"
[Outro]
Last night, you said, "Empty your head, be here with me
Shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance
Tune out the noise for a moment" (For a moment)
You said, "Let's just shut off the lights, we don't need them to dance"
