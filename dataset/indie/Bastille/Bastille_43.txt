[Verse 1]
Roll the window down, let the air blow 'round you
A sadness in the breeze as the night divides us
[Pre-Chorus]
In these darker days, I push the limit to the love you offer
There's a riot in my head, demanding we do this forever
[Chorus]
Why would we divide when we could come together?
Just bodies that collide, lost and found each other
So don't, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Why would we divide when we could come together?
[Verse 2]
Looking back around, glamorize the chaos
Don't let summer nights destroy everything before us
[Pre-Chorus]
In these darker days, I push the limit to the love you offer
There's a riot in my head, demanding we do this forever
[Chorus]
Why would we divide when we could come together?
Just bodies that collide, lost and found each other
So don't, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Why would we divide when we could come together?
[Bridge]
So roll the window down, won't let you go like this
Go like this, go like this
Roll the window down, won't let you go like this
Go like this, go like this
[Chorus]
Why would we divide when we could come together?
Are we just bodies that collide? Lost and found each other
So don't, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me alone, don't leave me alone
Why would we divide when we could come together?
[Outro]
Roll the window down, won't let you go like this
Go like this, go like this
Roll the window down, won't let you go like this
Go like this, go like this
