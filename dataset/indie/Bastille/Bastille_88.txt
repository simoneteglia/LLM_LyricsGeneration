[Intro]
I miss you more
[Verse 1]
In my thoughts, you’re far away
And you are whistling the melody, whistling the melody
Crystallising clear as day
Oh, I can picture you so easily, picture you so easily
[Pre-Chorus]
What's gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world, oh?
[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
[Drop]
I miss you more, I miss you more
I miss you more, I miss you more
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you more
[Interlude]
I miss you more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I miss you more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Caught off-guard by your favourite song
Oh, I'll be dancing at a funeral, dancing at a funeral
Sleeping in the clothes you love
It’s such a shame we had to see them burn
Shame we had to see them burn
[Pre-Chorus]
What's gonna be left of the world if you’re not in it?
What's gonna be left of the world, oh?
[Chorus]
Every minute and every hour
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
Every stumble and each misfire
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you more
[Drop]
I miss you more, I miss you more
I miss you more, I miss you more
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you more
[Outro]
I miss you more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I miss you more, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I miss you more
