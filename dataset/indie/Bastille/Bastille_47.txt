[Verse 1]
There is no love lost here between us
Where are those friends who pulled no punches?
Shot from the hip with one another
We got so far from them
We're miles from way back when
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm so nervous saying this out loud
As the words roll off my tongue and out my mouth...
[Chorus]
I can see a change
I can see a change in you
I see it coursing through your veins
And it is a shame
Oh, it is a shame on you
I barely recognize your face
[Post-Chorus]
And I don't like what I'm seeing lately
Oh I don't like who I'm seeing lately
[Verse 2]
So many seasons fell beneath us
Too many voices on our shoulders
I miss us dancing through the same noise
But here we are my friend
We're miles from way back when
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never knew that I could be so down
I never knew that I could be so down until I told you...
[Chorus]
I can see a change
I can see a change in you
I see it coursing through your veins
And it is a shame
Oh it is a shame on you
I barely recognize your face
[Post-Chorus]
And I don't like what I'm seeing lately
Oh I don't like who I'm seeing lately
[Bridge]
Maybe I'm living in the past
Who am I to judge
I'm the worst of all
Some things are better left unsaid
But I miss the person I knew before
[Chorus]
And I can see a change
I can see a change in you
I see it coursing through your veins
And it is a shame
Oh it is a shame on you
I barely recognize your face
[Post-Chorus]
And I don't like what I'm seeing lately
Oh I don't like who I'm seeing lately
[Outro]
I don't know who I'm seeing lately
Oh I don't know who I'm seeing lately
