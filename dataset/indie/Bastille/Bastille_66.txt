[Into]
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
[Verse 1]
We are the last people standing
At the end of the night
We are the greatest pretenders
In the cold morning light
[Pre-Chorus]
This is just another night
And we've had many of them
To the morning we're cast out
But I know I'll land here again
[Chorus]
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
[Verse 2]
There's a light in the bedroom
But it's dark
Scattered around on the floor
All my thoughts
[Pre-Chorus]
This is just another night
And we've had many of them
To the morning we're cast out
But I know I'll land here again
[Chorus]
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
Oh, how am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
[Bridge]
The birds are mocking me
They call to be heard
The birds are mocking me
They curse my return
[Chorus]
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
Oh, how am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I
How am I gonna get myself back home? I, I, I'm lost
