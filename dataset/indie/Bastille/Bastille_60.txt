[Intro: Jacob Banks and
Dan Smith
]
Say it to my face
Ooh
Call me baby
Ooh
Tear me down
[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
Tell me how it feels to be on the outside
With your hands on the glass
'Cause we know it's the easiest thing in the world
To be that cynical
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith]
I looked up to you
Oh, I trusted you
I put faith in you, guess that's what you do
Now I'll stare you out as you pass me on the way down
I'll stare you out as you pass me on the way down
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
Be the one, be the one, be the one to call me baby
Even though you're the one who would always tear me down
Be the one, be the one, be the one to call me baby
Even though you're the one who would always tear me down
[Verse 2: Lily Moore]
How don't you get exhausted
Spitting forward so much bile?
Shame that your time is ticking
And you are so replaceable
[Pre-Chorus: Lily Moore,
Moss Kena
,
Lily Moore & Dan Smith
]
I looked up to you
(I looked up to you)
Oh, I trusted you
(Trusted you)
I put faith in you
(I put faith)
Guess that's
what you do
Now I'll stare you out as you pass me on the way down
I'll stare you out as you pass me on the way down (Down, down)
[Chorus: Dan Smith & Moss Kena]
Be the one, be the one, be the one to call me baby
Even though you're the one who would always tear me down
Be the one, be the one, be the one to call me baby
Even though you're the one who would always tear me down
[Bridge: Dan Smith, Moss Kena, & Lily Moore]
'Cause I put faith into you
I put faith into you
Oh, I put faith into you
And I will break a smile when you fall
[Chorus: Dan Smith & Moss Kena]
Be the one, be the one, be the one to call me baby
Even though you're the one who would always tear me down
Be the one, be the one, be the one to call me baby
Even though you're the one who would always tear me down
[Post-Chorus: Lily Moore and
Dan Smith
]
Tear me down
Call me baby
You tear me down
Call me baby
Baby why did you tear me down?
Tear me down
Tear me down
Call me baby
Tear me down
Tear me down
Oh, call me baby
Tear me down
[Verse 3: Jacob Banks]
You won't call me by my name
(Oh call me, baby)
While I'm still sitting in your grace
(Oh tear me down)
You won't say it to my face
(Oh call me, baby)
While I'm falling from your grace
(Oh tear me down)
You won't call me by my name
(Oh call me, baby)
While I'm still sitting in your grace
(Oh tear me down)
You won't say it to my face
(Oh call me, baby)
Have I finally found your grace?
(Oh tear me down)
[Bridge]
What do you know about all the filth that's going on here, huh?
Kids who get high repeatedly don't want to come down
[Verse 4: Dan Smith,
Lily Moore
,
Dan Smith & Lily Moore
]
I breathe in hard
Don't speak, 'cause it's like a bitter pill
You blow my mind
You make my heart beat
Faster, faster, faster, faster, fast
The echoes of that news ring loud
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go
Leave it 'til the morning
I don't wanna know
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
A million pieces, oh,
oh, oh
A million pieces, oh
