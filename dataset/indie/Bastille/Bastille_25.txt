[Intro]
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
[Verse 1]
Lethargy got ahold of me
And I don't know how to shake it
Got these itchy feet for a change of scene
Do anything to escape it
[Pre-Chorus]
Get up, get up, pressure, pressure
Run away as fast as you can go
Every day your friends and lovers
Give the answers everybody knows
[Chorus]
You told me not to be like anybody else, headspin, happiness, death
Be like anybody else, broke down, nothing else left
You checked out years ago, oh, what I'd do not to worry like you
You checked out years ago, oh, what I'd do not to worry like you
[Post-Chorus/Interlude]
"C'mon, relax"
[Verse 2]
There's an Englishman up in space these days
Floating in awe and wonder
As he broke away from the atmosphere
And all of us non-believers
[Pre-Chorus]
Get up, get up, pressure, pressure
Run away as fast as you can go
Every day your friends and lovers
Give the answers everybody knows
[Chorus]
You told me not to be like anybody else, headspin, happiness, death
Be like anybody else, broke down, nothing else left
You checked out years ago, oh, what I'd do not to worry like you
You checked out years ago, oh, what I'd do not to worry like you
[Bridge]
Paint the scene for me, paint it bright and paint it clear
I don't want to use my imagination here, don't want to use my imagination here
Paint the scene for me, paint it bright and paint it clear
I don't want to use my imagination here, don't want to use my imagination here
[Chorus]
You told me not to be like anybody else, headspin, happiness, death
Be like anybody else, broke down, nothing else left
You checked out years ago, oh, what I'd do not to worry like you
You checked out years ago, oh, what I'd do not to worry like you
