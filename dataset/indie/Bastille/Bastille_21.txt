[Intro: Spoken]
- 'What do you know about it?'
- 'What's wrong, you can tell me'
- 'Why, I can't tell you. You don't—, you can't—, you can't explain now what's going on in your brain. You can't tell somebody how lit—, wha-what's happening, what's going on in your mind, I can't.'
- 'Why don't you just try?'
[Verse 1]
Let those fools be loud, let alarms ring out
'Cause you cut through all the noise
Let the days be dark, let me hate my work
'Cause you cut through all the noise
[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me some hope by wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto morning, noon, day, or night
[Chorus]
You are the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tied to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time, I think of you all the time
[Verse 2]
Let the parties end when we lose our friends
'Cause you cut through all the noise
Let the years roll on till the static comes
'Cause you cut through all the noise
[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me some hope by wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto morning, noon, day, or night
[Chorus]
You are the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tied to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time, I think of you all the time
All the time, all the time, I think of you all the time
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me some hope by wandering into my mind
Something to hold onto morning, noon, day, or night
[Chorus]
You are the light that is blinding me
You're the anchor that I tied to my brain
'Cause when it feels like I'm lost at sea
You're the song I sing again and again
All the time, all the time, I think of you all the time
All the time, all the time, I think of you all the time
