[Intro]
(Yeah, woo-hoo, ooh)
'"What the fuck are y'all doing?" is the question
This is the question'
[Verse 1]
The animals break out their cages now
Chaos is raining down around us, but
Here we stand with our arms folded
Do you wanna be free of this?
When panic rises like the oceans
We just keep on flicking through the stations 'cause
If we don't post, it doesn't happen
Oh, I wanna be free of this
[Pre-Chorus]
Have you and I been sleepwalking way too long?
Won't someone pour ice water on me?
[Chorus]
It only matters if we care now (Yeah, woo-hoo), if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now (Yeah, woo-hoo), if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders
[Verse 2]
Movies and news on television
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference, oh
When real life's more fucked up than fiction
Do you wanna be free of this?
[Pre-Chorus]
Have you and I been sleepwalking way too long?
Won't someone pour ice water on me?
[Chorus]
It only matters if we care now (Yeah, woo-hoo), if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now (Yeah, woo-hoo), if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
[Bridge]
I don't wanna play dumb (Dumb) anymore
I just wanna feel something (Something) like before
I don't wanna feel numb (Numb) anymore
I just wanna feel something (Something) like before
[Chorus]
It only matters if we care now (Yeah, woo-hoo), if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders
And I remember when we cared now (Yeah, woo-hoo), if you're way beyond that
Then I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders
[Outro]
(Yeah, woo-hoo)
'Television viewers have the choice of watching the tragedy play out from the safety and comfort of their living rooms
But victims have to respond to the pressure of the media while still in shock'
(Yeah, woo-hoo)
If you're way beyond that
I'm gonna dust you off of my shoulders, my shoulders
Ayy
Ayy
Ayy
Ayy
