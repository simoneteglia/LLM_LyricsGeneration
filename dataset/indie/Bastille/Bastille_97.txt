[Intro: Dan Smith]
Who knows what the future holds?
Don't matter if I got you, got you
Who knows what the future holds?
Don't matter if I got you
No, no, no
Don't matter if I got you, got—
Don't matter if I got you
[Verse 1: Dan Smith,
BIM
]
It's not about my dreams, I'll get over my nightmares
Don't wanna just wake up at the ending
Don't blink, I'll miss it all and dead boys don't remember (
Oh, oh-oh-oh
)
The shit we never did will haunt us (
Oh, oh-oh-oh
)
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith]
I can't live fast and die young
obsessing over the future (Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Horizon)
I come undone
when you're gone just looking over my shoulder
(Behind ya)
[Chorus: Dan Smith & BIM]
Who knows what the future holds?
Don't matter if I got you, got you
Who knows what the future holds?
Don't mattеr if I got you
No, no, no (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Don't matter if I got you, got—
Don't matter if I got you
[Verse 2: Dan Smith]
No dress rеhearsal life, no refunds, no rewinding (
Oh, oh-oh-oh
)
Don't lose sleep over the truth, we can't find it (
Oh, oh-oh-oh
)
Their happy-ending myth, I'd settle for religion
Some champagne-popping bliss to remember
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith & BIM]
I can't live fast and die young
obsessing over the future (Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Horizon)
I come undone
when you're gone just looking over my shoulder
(Behind ya)
[Chorus: Dan Smith,
BIM
]
Who knows what the future holds?
Don't matter if I got you, got you
Who knows what the future holds?
Doesn't matter if I got you, got you?
Who knows what the future holds? (Future holds)
Don't matter if I got you, got you
Who knows what the future holds?
Don't matter if I got you
[Outro: Dan Smith,
BIM
]
Who knows what the future holds? (I don't know)
Don't matter if I got you, got you (I got you)
Who knows what the future holds? (I don't know)
Don't matter if I got you (Got you)
Who knows what the future holds? (I don't know; Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Don't matter if I got you, got you (I got you; Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Who knows what the future holds? (I don't know; Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Don't matter if I got you
(Got you)
