[Verse 1]
Thought I'd never be waking on the kitchen floor
But here I lie, not the first time
Now my morning has broken, and it brings the fear
My mind's falling, fall in
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I feel my pulse quickening
But regrets can't change anything
Yeah, I feel my pulse quickening
When your name lights up the screen
[Chorus]
Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
[Post-Chorus]
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?
[Verse 2]
Take a walk through the wreckage, clearing out my head
I hear your eyes roll right down the phone
I'm your walking disaster, keep on dragging me
From self-pity, poor me
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I feel my pulse quickening
But I wouldn't change a thing
[Chorus]
Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
[Post-Chorus]
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?
[Bridge]
As the night dissolves into this final frame
You're a sweet relief, you saved me from my brain
From my brain, from my brain, from my brain
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Oh joy, when you call me
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
Joy, set my mind free
I was giving up, oh, I was giving in
[Post-Chorus]
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?
[Outro]
I feel joy when you call me
I feel joy when you call me (I-I-I feel joy)
I feel joy when you call me
I feel joy when you call me
How d'you always know when I'm down?
How d'you always know when I'm down?
