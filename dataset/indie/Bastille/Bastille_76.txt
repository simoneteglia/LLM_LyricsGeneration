[Intro]
Oh you were always stronger than I was
Oh you were always stronger than I was
[Verse 1]
Oh Delilah
On a summer night, you came for me
My eyes were wide shut, opened my mind
Said you loved me
In the heat of it, I replied
"Drunk lust is blind, love, can't choose your type"
[Refrain]
You were always stronger than I was
Oh, you were always stronger than I was
[Chorus]
I got a good lesson in love
Taught through my bed
Like a wildfire
You showed me
A good lesson
Good, good lesson
Good lesson in love
[Verse 2]
In the morning
With a heavy head, an empty bed
Had a good time, you can't hold a good time
Oh you played me, like I was music made by your hands
Still ringing out and echoing around
[Refrain]
You were always stronger than I was
Oh, you were always stronger than I was
[Chorus]
I got a good lesson in love
Taught through my bed
Like a wildfire
You showed me
A good lesson
Good, good lesson
Good lesson in love
[Bridge]
The weaker you made me, the stronger I felt
The higher you built me, the further I fell
The weaker you made me, the stronger I felt
The higher you built me, the further I fell
[Refrain]
You were always stronger than I was
Oh you were always stronger than I was
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I got a good lesson in love
I got a good lesson in love
From you, good lesson
Good, good lesson
Good lesson in love
[Chorus]
I got a good lesson in love
Taught through my bed
Like a wildfire
You showed me
A good lesson
Good, good lesson
Good lesson in love
[Outro]
A good lesson
Good, good lesson
(You showed me)
A good lesson
Good, good lesson
(A good, good lesson)
A good lesson
Good, good lesson
(You showed me, you showed me)
(A good lesson in love)
