[Intro]
"Intermittent, continuous, loud and excessive noise wears a man down!"
[Verse 1]
As the night time bleeds into the day
And tomorrow spills across the sky
While the sun’s a harsh reminder why
We are feeling barely human
[Pre-Chorus]
We don’t know what’s good for us
Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won’t discover ‘til we push it
[Chorus]
I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away
Walk away, oh it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms
[Verse 2]
We got drunk on this unholy wine
To deliver us from our old minds
A promise of a better time
'Til we’re feeling barely human
[Pre-Chorus]
We don’t know what’s good for us
Cause if we did, we might not do it
Who knows where our limits lie?
We won’t discover ‘til we push it
[Chorus]
I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away, away
Oh, it grips me
[Bridge]
I would rather forget
And wash my memory clean
Oh, I would rather forget
And wash my memory clean
I would rather forget (I would rather forget)
And wash my memory clean (Wash my memory clean)
I would rather forget (I would rather forget)
And wash my memory clean (Wash my memory clean)
[Chorus]
I should just walk away, walk away
But it grips me, it grips me
But I should call it a day
And make my way
Oh, it grips me
Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away, away
It grips me
(It grips me, it grips me)
Oh oh
(It grips me, it grips me)
[Chorus]
Cause the devil’s got my arms
And it pulls me back into the dark
But I should just walk away, away
It grips me
