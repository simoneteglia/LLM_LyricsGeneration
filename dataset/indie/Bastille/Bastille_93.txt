[Verse 1]
I try to forget you, I try to move on
To run from the memories that keep me up till dawn
They break every silence, your voice is in my head
It echoes through the nights when you're there with someone else
[Pre-Chorus]
Who's there beside you? (Who's there? Who's there?)
Who's there to guide you? (Who's there? Who's there?)
Who's there to sleep beside you?
[Chorus]
You remind me of the things that I miss
On my sleepless nights, you haunt me, I miss your lips
You remind me of our days, they're too good to fade away
Oh-oh, oh-oh, I remember them
Oh-oh, oh-oh, do you think of them?
[Post-Chorus]
(Uh)
(Yeah)
(So)
[Verse 2]
All the places you showed me, we were dancing to your beat
I still trace our shadows across the midnight streets
I'm trapped in these scenes that I would die to leave behind
Oh, just like Eternal Sunshine, can I delete you from my mind?
[Pre-Chorus]
Who's there beside you? (Who's there? Who's there?)
Who's there to guide you? (Who's there? Who's there?)
Who's there to sleep beside you?
[Chorus]
You remind me of the things that I miss
On my sleepless nights, you haunt me, I miss your lips
You remind me of our days, they're too good to fade away
Oh-oh, oh-oh, I remember them
Oh-oh, oh-oh, do you think of them?
[Bridge]
Why can't I forget to remember
I forget to remember
I forget to remember you?
Why can't I forget to remember
I forget to remember
I forget to remember you?
[Chorus]
You remind me of the things that I miss
And on my sleepless nights, you haunt me, I miss your lips
You remind me of our days, they're too good to fade away
Oh-oh, oh-oh, I remember them
Oh-oh, oh-oh, do you think of them?
Hey
[Outro]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, I remember them)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, do you think of them?)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
