[Verse 1]
Oh, I feel overjoyed
When you listen to my words
I see them sinking in
Oh, I see them crawling underneath your skin
[Pre-Chorus]
Words are all we have
We'll be talking, we'll be talking
These words are all we have
We'll be talking
[Chorus]
And I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night
[Verse 2]
You lean towards despair
Any given opportunity you're there
But what is there to gain
When you're always falling off the fence that way?
[Pre-Chorus]
Words are all we have
We'll be talking, we'll be talking
These words are all we have
We'll be talking
[Chorus]
And I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-ah
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-ah
[Chorus]
And I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night
Oh, I hear you calling in the dead of night
[Outro]
Oh, I feel overjoyed
When you listen to my words
