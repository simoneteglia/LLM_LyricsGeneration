[Verse 1]
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are laid out one by one
A wonderful part of the mess that we made, we pick ourselves undone
All of your flaws and all of my flaws, they lie there hand in hand
Ones we've inherited, ones that we learn, they pass from man to man
[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul, I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul, can you fill it? Can you fill it?
[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground
[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up, let's finish what we've started
Dig them up, so nothing's left unturned
[Verse 2]
All of your flaws and all of my flaws, when they have been exhumed
We'll see that we need them to be who we are, without them, we'd be doomed
[Pre-Chorus]
There's a hole in my soul, I can't fill it, I can't fill it
There's a hole in my soul, can you fill it? Can you fill it?
[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground
[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up, let's finish what we've started
Dig them up, so nothing's left unturned
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted
When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted
[Chorus]
You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground
[Post-Chorus]
Dig them up, let's finish what we've started
Dig them up, so nothing's left unturned
[Breakdown]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
[Outro]
All of your flaws and all of my flaws are laid out one by one
Look at the wonderful mess that we made
We pick ourselves undone
