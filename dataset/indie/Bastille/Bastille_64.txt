[Intro]
All that I've got to be thankful for
All that I've got to be thankful for
In the heat, try to love these streets
[Verse 1]
In this town, it all went down
Our chromosomes
in sepia tones
In my mind, in my mind
Where you led your lives before
From our small island, brought right back
To these shores, to these shores, to these shores
[Chorus]
It’s alive, it’s alive when I see it through your eyes
It’s alive, it’s alive, now, I understand your lives
When you take me there
You show me the city, I see it through your eyes
When you take me there
We drive through the city beneath the Durban skies
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
All that I've got to be thankful for
[Verse 2]
On the day, you made your vows
The heavens opened, rain poured down
It poured down, down, down
Grey and brown, the seventies
The suits you wore and the ones you loved
Were so young, were so young, God, you were so young
[Chorus]
It’s alive, it’s alive when I see it through your eyes
It’s alive, it’s alive, now, I understand your lives
When you take me there
You show me the city, I see it through your eyes
When you take me there
We drive through the city beneath the Durban skies
[Bridge]
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh-oh oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh oh
All that I've got to be thankful for
Oh, all that I've got to be thankful for
All that I've got to be thankful for
[Chorus]
It’s alive, it’s alive when I see it through your eyes
It’s alive, it’s alive, now, I understand your lives
When you take me there
You show me the city, I see it through your eyes
When you take me there
We drive through the city beneath the Durban skies
[Outro]
When you take me there, there
When you take me there, there
When you take me there, it’s alive, it’s alive
When you take me there, it's alive, it's alive
