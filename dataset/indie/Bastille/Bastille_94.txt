[Verse 1]
I drove past your house last night
And it all came crashing in every memory
I didn't recognize your street
Now the light hits differently 'cause you're not with me
[Pre-Chorus]
Was I not what you want?
Was I not what you need?
I can't crawl at your feet
This ain't healthy for me
(This ain't healthy for me, me, me)
[Chorus]
I run into trouble tryna let you go
'Cause I still feel the high, the love, the vertigo
My head's gonna spin around until I let you know
That I just can't get over you, I just can't get over you
I run into trouble tryna let you go
'Cause I still feel the high, the love, the vertigo
My hеad's gonna spin around until I let you know
That I just can't get over you, I just can't gеt over you
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh (I just can't get over you)
Yeah, I just can't get over you
Ooh, ooh (I just can't get over you)
Yeah, I just can't get over you
[Verse 2]
I'm at that restaurant you love
Wondering what the hell I want, I'm stupid to come here
Then your favourite song comes on
I roll my eyes and sing along 'cause I never liked it
[Pre-Chorus]
Was I not what you want?
Was I not what you need?
I can't crawl at your feet
This ain't healthy for me
(This ain't healthy for me, me, me)
[Chorus]
I run into trouble tryna let you go
'Cause I still feel the high, the love, the vertigo
My head's gonna spin around until I let you know
That I just can't get over you, I just can't get over you
[Bridge]
Woah, I, woah, I just can't get you out of my mind
Woah, I, woah, I just can't get you out of my mind
[Chorus]
So I run into trouble tryna let you go
'Cause I still feel the high, the love, the vertigo
My head's gonna spin around until I let you know
That I just can't get over you, I just can't get over you
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh (I just can't get over you)
Yeah, I just can't get over you
Ooh, ooh (I just can't get over you)
Yeah, I just can't get over you
