[Verse 1]
Ooh, there's no bread, let 'em eat cake
There's no end to what they'll take
Flaunt the fruits of noble birth
Wash the salt into the earth
[Chorus]
But they're marching to Bastille Day
The guillotine will claim her bloody prize
Free the dungeons of the innocent
The king will kneel and let his kingdom rise
[Verse 2]
Ooh, bloodstained velvet, dirty lace
Naked fear on every face
See them bow their heads to die
As we would bow when they rode by
[Chorus]
And we're marching to Bastille Day
The guillotine will claim her bloody prize
Sing, oh choirs of cacophony
The king has kneeled to let his kingdom rise
[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Lessons taught but never learned
All around us, anger burns
Guide the future by the past
Long ago the mould was cast
[Chorus]
For they marched up to Bastille Day
The guillotine claimed her bloody prize
Hear the echoes of the centuries
Power isn't all that money buys
Oh!
