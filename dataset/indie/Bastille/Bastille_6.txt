[Intro]
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
[Verse]
There must be something in the Kool-Aid
Cruising through the doom days
God knows what is real and what is fake
Last couple years have been a mad trip
How'd y’all look so perfect?
You must have some portraits in the attic
We'll stay offline so no one gets hurt
Hiding from the real world
Just don't read the comments ever, ever
We fucked this house up like the planet
We were running riot
Crazy that some people still deny it
Think I’m addicted to my phone
My scrolling horror show
I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome
One tab along, it's pornographic
Everybody's at it
No surprise we're so easily bored
Let's pick the truth that we believe in
Like a bad religion
Tell me all your original sins
So many questionable choices
We love the sound that our voice makes
Man, this echo chamber's getting loud
We're gonna choose the blue pill
We’re gonna close the curtains
We’re gonna rabbit hole down
,
third act love now
She's gonna flip some tables
I’m gonna move this tale on
We're gonna rabbit hole down,
third act love now
We'll be the proud remainers
Here 'til the morning breaks us
We run away from real life thoughts tonight
We’re gonna Peter Pan out
Fade to the close-up, arms 'round
We're gonna stay naive tonight, night, night
[Chorus]
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
You
All I think about is you
So I put my phone down
Fall into the night with you
