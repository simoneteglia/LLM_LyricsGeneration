[Verse 1]
All the things we tell ourselves
To feel a little better, better
All the lies we tell ourselves
When we don't have an answer
Don’t let me lie down
On the world, the world around us
Don't let me get down
When we're dancing in the dark
[Chorus]
’Cause I don't want to fall back again
Back into the easy days
Everything was so simple then
Little fires burned away
Oh won't you help me start a fire?
Come on won't you help me start a fire?
'Cause I don't want to fall back again
Back into the easy days
[Verse 2]
All the things we tell ourselves
To feel a little better, better
All the lies we tell ourselves
When we don't have an answer
Don't let me lie down
On the world, the world around us
Don’t let me get down
When we’re dancing in the dark
[Chorus]
'Cause I don’t want to fall back again
Back into the easy days
Everything was so simple then
Little fires burned away
Oh won't you help me start a fire?
Come on won't you help me start a fire?
'Cause I don’t want to fall back again
Back into the easy days
[Bridge]
Omen, you're a fire in the past
Overlooking trouble gone bad
Sugarcoat nostalgia, get lost
And why'd you want to be that guy?
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to fall back again
Back into the easy days
Everything was so simple then
Little fires burned away
Oh, won't you help me start a fire?
Come on won't you help me start a fire?
'Cause I don't want to fall back again
Back into the easy days
[Outro]
'Cause I don't wanna fall back again
Back into the easy days
