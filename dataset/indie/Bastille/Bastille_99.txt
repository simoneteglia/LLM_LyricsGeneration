[Intro]
"What have I got, Harry?"
[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know I made your eyes burn
I was like James Dean, for sure
I'm so fresh to death and sick as ca-ca-cancer
I was sorta punk rock, you grew up on hip hop
I fit you better than your favorite sweater
You know that love is mean, love hurts
You still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby
[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Baby, oh, I will love you 'til the end of time
[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangster
Said I had to leave to start my life over
You were like, "No, please, stay here"
We don't need no money we can make it all work
But I headed out on Sunday, said, I'd come home Monday
You stayed up waitin', anticipatin', and pacin'
But I was chasing paper
"Caught up in the game" that was the last you heard, oh, baby
[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Baby, oh, I will love you 'til the end of time
[Outro]
I will love you 'til the end of time
(You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve)
I would wait a million years
(And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground)
Baby, can you see through the tears?
(You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve)
Baby, oh
(And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground)
