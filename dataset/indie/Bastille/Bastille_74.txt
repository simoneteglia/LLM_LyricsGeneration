[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
Bad news like a sucker punch, what do you say? (Ah-ah, ah)
Air knocked out of my lungs, your cue to stay (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
When you hear something difficult, don't back away (Ah-ah, ah)
Some people say nothing, good ones engage
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith]
Don't turn your back on me,
don't bury your head deep
Just 'cause you don't know what to say
Don't turn your back on me,
don't bury your head deep
Just 'cause you don't know what to say
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
It's true
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news
Oh, it beats you black and blue before you see it coming
[Verse 2: MNEK,
Dan & MNEK
]
Bad news like a sucker punch blew me away (Ah-ah, ah)
People fill the streets like nothing has changed, yeah (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Clock hands tick along they don't look the same (They don't look the same) (Ah-ah, ah)
Planes fly overhead like any old day
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith,
MNEK
,
Dan & MNEK
]
Don't turn your back on me (
Don't you turn your back
)
Don't bury your head deep,
oh
Just 'cause you don't know what to say (
Don't know what to say
)
Don't turn your back on me
Don't bury your head deep
(
Don't you bury your head
)
Just 'cause you don't know what to say
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
It's true
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news
Oh, it beats you black and blue before you see it coming
[Bridge: Dan Smith]
Maybe I just want some words of distraction
I feel like I'm being consumed
Maybe I'm expecting the perfect reaction
To pull me back (back, back, back, back, back, back, back)
[Chorus: Dan Smith,
MNEK
]
It's true
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news
Oh, it beats you black and blue before you see it co-
It's true (So true)
That it kicks you in the teeth when you are least expecting
Bad news (
True
)
Oh, it beats you black and blue before you see it coming
[Outro: Dan Smith]
Before, before you see it coming
Before, before you see it coming
Before, before you see
You see it coming
Bad news
Before, before you see it coming
Before, before you see it coming
Before, before you see it
You see it coming
Bad news
Before, before you see it coming
Before, before you see it coming
Before, before you see it
You see it coming
Bad news
