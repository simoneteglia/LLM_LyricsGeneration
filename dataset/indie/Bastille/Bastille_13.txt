[Intro]
Mmh, mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh, mmh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
"Look who's digging their own grave"
That is what they all say
"You'll drink yourself to death"
Look who makes their own bed
Lies right down within it
And what will you have left?
Out on the front doorstep
Drinking from a paper cup
You won't remember this
Living beyond your years
Acting out all their fears
You feel it in your chest
[Pre-Chorus]
Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you
[Chorus]
Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
It's just begun
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 3]
Standing on the cliff face
Highest fall you'll ever grace
It scares me half to death
Look out to the future
But it tells you nothing
So take another breath
[Pre-Chorus]
Your hands protect the flames
From the wild winds around you
[Chorus]
Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave
[Bridge]
You put up your defences when you leave
You leave because you're certain of who you want to be
You're putting up your armour when you leave
And you leave because you're certain of who you want to be, oh
[Chorus]
Icarus is flying too close to the sun
And Icarus's life, it has only just begun
This is how it feels to take a fall
Icarus is flying towards an early grave
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
