[Verse 1]
(I-I, I-I)
(I-I)
I came here for sanctuary
Away from the winds and the sounds of the city (I-I)
I came here to get some peace
Way down deep where the shadows are heavy (I-I)
I can't help but think of you
In these four walls, my thoughts seem to wander (I-I)
To some distant century
When everyone we know is six feet under (I-I)
[Pre-Chorus]
When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
And we're side by side; it's always been just you and me for all to see
[Chorus]
When our lives are over and all that remains
Are our skulls and bones let's take it to the grave
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains (I-I)
[Verse 2]
I don't want to rest in peace
I'd rather be the ghost that annoys you (I-I)
I hope you can make me laugh
Six feet down when we're bored of each other (I,I)
A match is our only light
It's day of the dead and I'm Indiana Jones here (I-I)
These coins sit upon our eyes
Pool our funds; we'll pay the boat together
[Pre-Chorus]
When all of our friends are dead and just a memory
We'll lie side by side; it's always been just you and me for all to see
[Chorus]
When our lives are over and all that remains
Are our skulls and bones, let's take it to the grave
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains
[Bridge]
And now it's all before you
Hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
And now it's all before you
Hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
[Chorus]
When our lives are over and all that remains
Are our skulls and bones, let's take it to the grave
And hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains
