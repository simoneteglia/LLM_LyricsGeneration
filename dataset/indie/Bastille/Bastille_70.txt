[Intro]
Tell me we'll be all right
Say that we'll be fine
[Verse 1]
Plug me right in, jump through the screen
Final frontier, I can be anything
Maddening scenes, Anthropocene
Blink and you'll miss us like we were a dream
Maybe AI is the messiah
My machine's learned all my kinks and desires
Virtual porn, airbrush my jaw
Are we having fun yet
?
Endless hot takes, chaos'll reign
Guess we learned nothing from history's mistakes
Billionaires, rocket to Mars
Stuck on Earth drinking in drivеrless cars
Icecaps'll fall, Cali'll burn
Willful denial until it's my turn
Bunch of old whitе men who don't give a fuck
Are we having fun yet
?
[Chorus]
Tell me we'll be alright
Say that we'll be fine
Lie to me it's all right, right?
Say that we'll be fine
Just a little bit of tenderness
It's a little bit of tenderness
Say that we'll be all right, right?
Even if it's lies
[Verse 2]
Hollywood has painted us a fucked-up fate
Say you'll resurrect me as a young deepfake
Genius minds fix all our crimes
So we can have fun, yeah?
We're living in a sci-fi fantasy
I'm sleeping with the robot next to me
"Find planet B, that's all we need"
So we can have fun—
[Chorus]
Tell me we'll be all right
Say that we'll be fine
Lie to me it's all right, right?
Say that we'll be fine
Just a little bit of tenderness
It's a little bit of tenderness
Say that we'll be all right, right?
Even if it's lies
[Outro]
Just a little bit of tenderness
A little bit of tenderness
Say that we'll be all right
Even if it's lies
Just a little bit of tenderness
A little bit of tenderness
Say that we'll be all right
Even if it's lies
