[Verse 1]
Aim, throw your best shot right at me
'Cause pain, I can take it easily
Did you really think I'd fall to my knees
Just to pray for some sweet simplicity
?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause woah, you're squeezing my heart
Too hard in your bare hands, they hold too tight
And woah, the air is on fire
This room feels electric caught here in your sights
[Chorus]
Power, power
I will never understand the power you were holding over me
Power, power
Oh, you had it too long, yes, you had it too long
[Verse 2]
Pain, just synapses firing in our brains
So when you cut me, cut me deep
Hurt the ones you love the most easily
'Cause in time we show our Achilles' heels
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause woah, you're squeezing my heart
Too hard in your cold bare hands, they hold too tight
And woah, the air is on fire
This room feels electric caught here in your sights
[Chorus]
Power, power
I will never understand the power you were holding over me
Power, power
Oh, you had it too long, yes, you had it too long
[Bridge]
If you're gonna hit me, hit me harder (Hit me, hit me harder)
'Cause you better knock me out the first time
And if you're gonna do this, rip the plaster
(Do this, rip the plaster)
If you're gonna hit me, hit me harder than this
Power, power
Blows my mind to think I ever let you hold it over me
[Chorus]
Power, power
I will never understand the way I let you hold it over me
Power, oh, power
Well, you had it too long, yes, you had it too long
[Outro]
(Power) Oh-oh, oh, oh, (Power) Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Power, power
I let you have it too long, yes, you had it too long
