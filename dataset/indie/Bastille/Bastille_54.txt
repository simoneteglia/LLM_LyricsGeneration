[Chorus]
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
[Verse 1]
Well, it fucked me up when I fell for you
I shouldn't have let me fall for you
The world is ending on the news
But here in my head, I’m drunk on you
My love, my love, unrequited
My love, my love, undecided
[Chorus]
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I think about is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I think about is you
[Verse 2]
Well it's Forrest Gump, one-sided news
My head's a cloud, my ego bruised
And drunken dreams, am I deluded?
I’m paranoid, hung up on you
No love, my love
She denies me
My love, my love
Set my mind free
[Chorus]
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I think about is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I think about is you
[Bridge]
Oh, lay me down in ash again
To watch the world crumble
Oh, lay me down in ash again
And watch the world crumble
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
When I watch the world burn
All I think about is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I think about is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All I think about is you
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
