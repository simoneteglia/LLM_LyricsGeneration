[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
I am bound to you with a tie that we cannot break
With a night that we can't replace
I'm lost but found with you in a bed that we'll never make
It's a feeling we always chase
[Pre-Chorus: Dan Smith]
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
[Post-Chorus: Dan Smith]
Mmm, in another time
And in another place
[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
I hate that you know
You can make me feel so small
Can't stop myself from falling back into you
We get so close then you pull yourself away
Maybe we just need a saving
Come save me
[Pre-Chorus: Alessia Cara]
I could write a book about the things that you said to me on the pillow
And the way you think and how you make me feel
You can fill my mind and move my body with the fiction, fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real
[Chorus: Dan Smith & Alessia Cara]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
[Bridge: Dan Smith &
Alessia Cara
]
It felt like something special but it never felt like love (ove)
Wonder what we could be living in another life (ife)
Catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love (ove)
Then you stop me talking as you kiss me from above
[Chorus: Dan Smith & Alessia Cara]
So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?
[Outro: Dan Smith &
Alessia Cara
]
Mmm
, yeah
In another time
And in another place
