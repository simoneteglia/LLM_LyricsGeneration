[Verse 1]
Obsession, it takes control
Obsession, it eats me whole
I can't say the words out loud
So in rhyme, I wrote you down
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, you live through the ages
I can feel your pulse in the pages
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh
[Chorus]
I have written you down now, you will live forever
And all the world will read you and you will live forever
In eyes not yet created, on tongues that are not born
I have written you down now, you will live forever
[Verse 2]
Your body lies upon the sheets
Of paper, and words so sweet
I can't say the words
So, I wrote you into my verse
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, you live through the ages
I can feel your pulse in the pages
Oh, woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
I have written you down now, you will live forever
And all the world will read you and you will live forever
In eyes not yet created, on tongues that are not born
I have written you down now, you will live forever
[Bridge]
I have read her with these eyes
I have read her with these eyes
I have held her in these hands
[Pre-Chorus]
I have written you down now, you will live forever
The virtue's in the verse and you will live forever
[Chorus]
I have written you down now, you will live forever
And all the world will read you and you will live forever
In eyes not yet created, on tongues that are not born
I have written you down now, you will live forever
[Outro]
You will live forever
