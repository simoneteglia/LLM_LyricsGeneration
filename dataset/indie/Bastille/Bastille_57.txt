[Intro]
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're noc-, we're noc-, we're nocturnal
[Verse 1]
You put your arms around me
Partners in crime in the dead of night
It's our weekend religion
A different chord but the same refrain
[Pre-Chorus]
We've only got ourselves to blame
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
Let every night play out the same
'Cause I wouldn't, I wouldn't change a thing
[Chorus]
We're nocturnal creatures, we own the night
And we don't need a reason if we want to lose our minds
We're nocturnal creatures, drawn to the flame
And the morning doesn't reach us
Well, not until we want it to, want it to
[Post-Chorus]
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're noc-, we're noc-, we're nocturnal
[Verse 2]
No moon, no stars above us
The orange sky says the night's alive
This time with you's elastic
We stretch these hours as far as we can make them go
[Pre-Chorus]
We've only got ourselves to blame
Again and again and again
Again and again and again
Let every night play out the same
'Cause I wouldn't, I wouldn't change a thing
[Chorus]
We're nocturnal creatures, we own the night (We own the night)
And we don't need a reason if we want to lose our minds
We're nocturnal creatures, drawn to the flame (Drawn to the flame)
And the morning doesn't reach us
Well, not until we want it to, want it to
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
[Chorus]
We're nocturnal creatures, we own the night (We own the night)
And we don't need a reason if we want to lose our minds
We're nocturnal creatures, drawn to the flame (Drawn to the flame)
And the morning doesn't reach us
Well, not until we want it to, want it to
[Outro]
Oh, oh
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
Oh, oh
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
Oh, oh
We're noc-, we're noc-, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
Oh, oh
We're nocturnal, we're nocturnal
We're noc-, we're noc-, we're nocturnal
[Spoken]
We received the freedom but we were completely unaware what to do with this freedom
It felt like the hungry people received the foods and we just ate everything
