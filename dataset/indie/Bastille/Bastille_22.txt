[Verse 1]
These four walls to keep you
One floor to sleep upon and only these four walls to keep you
([?])
These four walls contain you
Supposed to save you from yourself and
these four walls in
Holcomb
To keep you from the sun
([?])
[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're faced with two wrongs, now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
Now we're faced with two wrongs, now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
[Chorus]
We could be born to anything, and now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible, and now you, and now you
Now you carry it with you
You carry it with you, you carry it with you
[Verse 2]
These four walls will keep you
Until you face the rope
You've only these four walls before they
In cold blood,
hang you up
([?])
[Pre-Chorus]
And now we're faced with two wrongs, now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
And now we're faced with two wrongs, now we're faced with two wrongs
I don't know, oh, I don't know
[Chorus]
We could be born to anything, and now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible, and now you, and now you
Now you carry it with you
You carry it with you, you carry it with you
[Post-Chorus]
Now you carry it with you
Carry it with you, carry it with you
[Bridge]
There's no view from here
No view from here, no view from here
All you see's the sky
Clouds passing by, clouds passing by
(We could be born)
[Chorus]
We could be born to anything, and now what, now what?
What you have done is terrible, and now what, and now what?
Now you carry it with you
You carry it with you, you carry it with you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you, you carry it with you
Now, you carry it with you
You carry it with you, you carry it with you
[Instrumental]

This is a collect call from Kansas State Penitentiary:
"Being brought up one way and trying to see another way is very difficult"
