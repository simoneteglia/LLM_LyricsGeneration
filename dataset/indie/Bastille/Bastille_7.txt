[Verse 1]
When you fall asleep with your head upon my shoulder
When you're in my arms but you've gone somewhere deeper
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to age without mistakes?
Are you going to age with grace?
Or only to wake and hide your face?
[Chorus]
When oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
[Verse 2]
When you play it hard and I try to follow you there
It's not about control, but I turn back when I see where you go
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you going to age with grace?
Are you going to leave a path to trace?
[Chorus]
When oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
When oblivion is calling out your name
You always take it further than I ever can
