[Intro: Dan Smith,
Rationale
]
I'm the lesser of two evils
Or am I, am I tricking myself nice?
Oh, I'll bring you flowers
Oh, yeah, eh yeah yeah, ah
[Chorus: Rationale]
I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
The tears you cry, I'll dry them all away
[Verse 1: Rationale & Dan Smith,
Rationale & James Arthur
]
From the day until the day we throw it all away
Let's talk about it 'cause I cannot live without it
Your love,
it means so much to me
Can't you see? Right here, I'll always be
[Verse 2: Dan Smith,
Dan Smith & Rationale
,
Dan Smith & James Arthur
]
Oh, by the way
Did I say, oh, how you're made to stay?
Right here beside you, I will never deny you
My love, you are everything to me
Can't you see?
I will give to you
unselfishly
[Pre-Chorus: Rationale]
Because I need you so (Oh, baby)
And I will never, ever let you go
[Chorus: Dan Smith & Rationale,
Rationale
,
Dan Smith
]
I'll bring you flowers in the pouring rain
Living without you is driving me insane
I'll bring you flowers, I'll make your day
The tears you cry
,
I'll dry them all away
[Verse 3: James Arthur,
Dan Smith & James Arthur
, (Rationale)]
By the way, did I say? Oh
(Oh, baby)
By the way, did I say? Oh
(Oh, baby)
Yeah, and if one day, you went away, I'd feel so lonely inside
I can't deny that I would break down and cry
Yeah, and all those flowers, they would wilt in the rain
It would cause me misery, pain
[Pre-Chorus: Rationale &
James Arthur
]
Because I need you so (
I need you, babe
)
And I will never, ever let you go (
I'll never let you go
)
[Chorus: Rationale,
James Arthur
]
I'll bring you flowers
(I'll bring you flowers)
In the pouring rain
(Oh)
Living without you
(Is driving me)
Is driving me insane
(Is driving me insane)
I'll bring you flowers
(Bring you flowers)
I'll make your day
(I'll make your day)
The tears you cry
(The tears you cry)
I'll dry them all away
[Outro: Dan Smith,
James Arthur
]
Oh, by the way, did I say? Oh (
Oh, call me, baby
)
By the way, did I say? Oh (
Oh, tear me down
)
Oh, call me, baby
Oh, tear me down
(Oh)
