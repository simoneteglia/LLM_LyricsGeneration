[Intro]
(
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it
)
(
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it
)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 1]
We were young and drinking in the park
There was nowhere else to go
And you said you always had my back
Oh, but how were we to know?
[Pre-Chorus]
That these are the days that bind you together, forever
And these little things define you forever, forever
[Chorus]
All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 2]
If we're only ever looking back
We will drive ourselves insane
As the friendship goes, resentment grows
We will walk our different ways
[Pre-Chorus]
But those are the days that bind us together, forever
And those little things define us forever, forever
[Chorus]
All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?
[Bridge]
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore
I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore
(
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it
)
(
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it
)
I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore
(
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it
)
(
I don't wanna talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it
)
(
I don't wanna talk
)
[Chorus]
All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry?
It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie?
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
