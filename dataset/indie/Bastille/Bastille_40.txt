[Intro]
"So the question is, why doesn't he grow up?
Why does he still behave as a child?
How can we help him get rid of these leftovers from childish behavior?"
[Verse 1]
This is the winter of our youth, oh, but I'm not there yet
I've got nostalgia running through me and I don't like it
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my, my, my, my
Now, I can almost taste it, taste it
But I just hope we didn't waste it away
[Chorus]
I know the winter's getting colder, but why?
Just 'cause we're a little older, do I relive it, I relive it all?
I'm pedalling backwards even if I'm pedalling alone
Can't help it, I relive it, I relive it all
[Verse 2]
It's 4am, here comes the fear
, I'm not prepared yet
And when we pick over the past, we glorify it
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh my, my, my, my
I hope I wasn't wasted, wasted
And I, I hope I didn't drink it away
[Chorus]
I know the winter's getting colder, but why?
Just 'cause we're a little older, do I relive it, I relive it all?
I'm pedalling backwards even if I'm pedalling alone
Can't help it, I relive it, I relive it all
[Bridge]
I let myself bathe in the past for way, way, way too long
And now it seems I've drunk too much to give you what you want
[Chorus]
I know the winter's getting colder, but why?
Just 'cause we're a little older, do I relive it, I relive it all?
I'm pedalling backwards even if I'm pedalling alone
Can't help it, I relive it, I relive it all
[Outro]
Can't help it, I relive it, I relive it all
Can't help it, I relive it, I relive it all
I'm pedalling backwards even if I'm pedalling alone
Can't help it, I relive it, I relive it all
