[Intro]
Things we lost to the flames
Things we'll never see again
All that we have amassed
Sits before us, shattered into ash
[Chorus]
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
[Verse 1]
We sat and made a list of all the things that we had
Down the backs of table tops, ticket stubs and your diaries
I read them all one day when loneliness came and you were away
Oh, they told me nothing new, but I love to read the words you use
[Chorus]
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I was the match and you were the rock, maybe we started this fire
We sat apart and watched all we had burn on the pyre
You said, "We were born with nothing and we sure as hell have nothing now"
You said, "We were born with nothing and we sure as hell have nothing now"
[Chorus]
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things, the things we lost
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
[Bridge]
Do you understand that we will never be the same again?
Do you understand that we will never be the same again?
The future's in our hands and we will never be the same again
The future's in our hands and we will never be the same again
[Chorus]
These are the things (These are the things), the things we lost (The things we lost)
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
These are the things (These are the things), the things we lost (The things we lost)
The things we lost in the fire, fire, fire
Oh-oh-oh (These are the things, these are the things, the things we lost)
These are the things we lost (The things we lost) in the fire, fire, fire, oh
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
Flames, they licked the walls
Tenderly, they turned to dust all that I adored
