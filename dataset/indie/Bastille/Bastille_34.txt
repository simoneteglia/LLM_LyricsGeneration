[Intro: Dan Smith]
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
[Verse 1: Dan Smith]
Snakes are biting at my heels
The worries that refuse to let us go
I’ve been kicking them away
And hoping not to let them take control
[Pre-Chorus 1: Dan Smith]
Ooh, I’m not ready
Drink to escape their bites
Show me distraction
Even for just one night
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
'Cause it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-ole
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
[Verse 2: Dan Smith]
Now these days are feeling dark
We're struggling to figure out last year
When the woman on the news
Keeps saying things that no one wants to hear
[Pre-Chorus 2: Dan Smith]
Ooh, I’m not ready
Drink to escape our minds
Show me distraction
Even for just one night
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
'Cause it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
And I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-ole
Yes, I pray for the ground to swallow me who-o-ole
Ooh, I'm not ready
Ooh, I'm not ready
[Intermezzo]
"Come on, boys. Let's go tear this place apart!
(Woo, Oh!)"
[Bridge: Kyle Simmons]
'Cause I know life is simple when
I can just ignore it all
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
Life is simple when
I can just ignore it all
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
[Pre-Chorus 3: Dan Smith,
Kyle Simmons
]
If I’m not ready (
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
)
Snakes will consume me whole (
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
)
If I'm not steady (
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
)
Maybe they'll take control (
'Cause I know, 'cause I know, 'cause I know
)
[Chorus: Dan Smith]
But it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
Yes, it's easier to bury
My head in the sand sometimes
I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-ole
Yes, I know, I know, I know
It's not the right way to go
But I pray for the ground to swallow me who-o-ole
