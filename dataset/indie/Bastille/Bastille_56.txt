[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
These streets are yours, you can keep them
I don't want them
They pull me back and I surrender
To the memories I run from
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we have paved these streets
With moments of defeat
[Chorus]
But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
Oh, I won't show my face here anymore
[Verse 2]
These streets are yours, you can keep them
In my mind, it's like you haunt them
And passing through, I think I see you
In the shapes of other women
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we have stained these walls
With our mistakes and flaws
[Chorus]
But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
Oh, I won't show my face here anymore
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ah-ah-ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ah-ah-ah)
[Bridge]
All thatâ€™s left behind is a shadow on my mind (Shadow on my mind)
Oh, a shadow cast upon the wall is silhouette and nothing more (Shadow on my mind)
That is all that's left behind (All that's left behind)
[Chorus]
But even if we won't admit it to ourselves
We'll walk upon these streets and think of little else
So I won't show my face here anymore
Oh, I won't show my face here anymore
[Outro]
I won't show my face here anymore
I won't show my face here anymore
