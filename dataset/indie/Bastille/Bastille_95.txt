[Verse 1]
I keep on looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me, and I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary sits on the bedside table
The curtain's closed, the cat's in the cradle
And who would have thought that a boy like me could come to this?
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on the list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I'm lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's love in my proxy, no give it, all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
[Bridge]
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment is gone
I'm following my hands, not my head, I know
[Chorus]
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
[Outro]
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
