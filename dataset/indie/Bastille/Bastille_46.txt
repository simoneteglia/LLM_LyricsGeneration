[Verse 1]
Had a great seven-year, white-knuckle ride
Killin' time, flyin' high, as I held on tight
To you, to you
Did I blow my mind on the wild side?
Singin' "Hallelujah" to 'em every night
With you, with you
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna lie, say I've been alright
'Cause it feels like I've been livin' upside down
[Chorus]
What can I say? I'm survivin'
Crawlin' out these sheets to see another day
What can I say? I'm survivin'
And I'm gonna be fine, I'm gonna be fine
I think I'll be fine
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
My love, my love
Ooh, yeah
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
[Verse 2]
Like a thunder cloud in November rain
Is the black dog out, runnin' wild again
For you, for you?
Tryna stream my way to a better life
But I daydream crash like Vanilla Sky
Do you? Do you?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm not gonna lie and say I've been alright
'Cause it feels like I've been livin' upside down
[Chorus]
What can I say? I'm survivin'
Crawlin' out these sheets to see another day
What can I say? I'm survivin'
And I'm gonna be fine, I'm gonna be fine
I think I'll be fine
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
My love, my love
Ooh, yeah
Ba-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
[Chorus]
So what can I say? I'm survivin'
Just crawlin' out these sheets to see another day
Oh, what can I say? I'm survivin'
And I'm gonna be fine, I'm gonna be fine
I think I'll be fine
