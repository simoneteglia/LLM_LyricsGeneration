[Spoken Intro]
Three, four...
[Verse 1]
I’m the lesser of two evils
Or am I, am I tricking myself nice?
If I’m the lesser of two evils
Who’s this man, who’s this act I hide behind?
[Chorus]
There are two ways to skin tonight
Let’s see whose road gets there faster
This is a game no wrongs no right
Only a winner and a loser
You and I, oh you and I
We’re not that different you and I
Oh you and I, you and I
We’re not that different you and I
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Well I'm the lesser of two evils
So keep looking, just keep looking into my eyes
And as the lesser of two evils
It pays to, pays to be the nice guy sometimes
[Chorus]
There are two ways to skin tonight
Let’s see whose road gets there faster
Here I am hiding in plain sight
If you’re not careful you will lose her
You and I, you and I
We’re not that different you and I
Oh you and I, you and I
We’re not that different you and I
[Outro]
You and I, you and I
We're not that different, you and I
