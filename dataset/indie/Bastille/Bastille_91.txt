[Intro: (Kianja)]
Free your body and
Free your body and
Free your body and your mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Craig David & Dan Smith,
Craig David
]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
(Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control
(Don't let go)
[Verse 1: Kianja &
Dan Smith
]
I often tell myself that we could be
More than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon
It would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied 'til we're taking those vows
[Pre-Chorus: Craig David & Dan Smith]
There'll be some love making, heartbreaking, soul shaking love
Love making, heartbreaking, soul shaking
[Chorus: Craig David & Dan Smith,
Craig David
]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
(Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control
(Don't let go)
(
Now wait a minute, now wait a minute
)
[Verse 2: Dan Smith & (Kianja)]
I often fantasize the stars above are watching you
They know my heart and speak to yours like lovers only do
If I could wear your clothes, I'd pretend I was you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) And lose control
[Pre-Chorus: Craig David]
There'll be some love making, heartbreaking, soul shaking love
Love making, heartbreaking, soul shaking
[Chorus: Craig David & Dan Smith,
Craig David
]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
(Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control
(Don't let go)
(Now wait a minute, now wait a minute)
[Verse 3: Swarmz]
Baby, don't let go, I had you from the get go
I don't really wanna play no foolish game
Baby, don't let go, I had you from the get go
I know that you know me and you know my name
Come, baby, here, it's me and you, it's you and I
The way you move, girl, come be mine
Come, baby, here, it's me and you, it's you and I
The way you move, girl, come be mine
[Verse 3: Kianja,
Kianja & Craig
David, Craig David
]
Running in and out my life, yeah
It's got me so confused
You gotta make the sacrifice, yeah
Somebody's got to choose
And
we can make it if we try
For the sake of you and I
Together, we can make it right
[Chorus: Craig David, Dan Smith & Kianja,
Craig David
]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend? (
Oh no
)
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
(
Don't you wanna be more than friends? Yeah
)
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)
[Outro]
Now, now wait a minute, now wait a minute
