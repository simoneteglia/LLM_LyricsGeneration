[Intro]
Don't talk to strangers
[Verse 1]
Oh, in the strangest dreams, walking by your side
It is the hole and you impose upon your life
When you're out, loneliness, it crawls up in the ground
It's what you feel, but can't articulate out loud
[Chorus]
Oh, you go to sleep on your own and you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone, it's a last resort
[Verse 2]
All you want is someone onto whom you can cling
Your mother warned of strangers and the dangers they may bring
Your dreams and memories are blurring into one
The seams which hold the waking world slowly come undone
You'll come undone
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, you go to sleep on your own and you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone, it's a last resort
You go to sleep on your own and you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone, it's a last resort
[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Don't talk to strangers
And don't walk into danger
Don't talk to strangers
And don't walk into danger, oh
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, you go to sleep on your own and you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone, it's a last resort
You go to sleep on your own and you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone, it's a last resort
[Outro]
Don't talk to strangers
Oh, you go to sleep on your own and you wake each day with your thoughts
And it scares you being alone, it's a last resort
