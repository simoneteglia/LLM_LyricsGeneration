[Intro]
*gasp*
[Verse 1]
So her fingers ran away with themselves
Till everything was documented
Her mind it was reaching out
To put into words what their bodies had done
[Chorus]
They lie together — oil on water
And they lie upon her
, someone's daughter
[Verse 2]
It's a catalogue of modern mistakes
Her words and legs wrapped around each man
Leaving stories like digital crumbs
As she turns these nights into literature
[Chorus]
They lie together — oil on water
And they lie upon her
, someone's daughter
[Interlude]
*gasp*
[Verse 3]
When they leave, she sets about writing down
Awkward body games all over town
Warm affection runs through every word
We're screens away, but we're laughing with her
[Chorus]
They lie together — oil on water
Oh, they lie upon her
, someone's daughter
[Outro]
They lie upon her, oil on water
