[Verse 1]
It isn't enough
To start a riot
Distort the light beam
Until I like me
It isn't enough
If this is real life
I'll stick to dreamin'
Come see what I see
[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling like
If this is life
I'm choosin' fiction
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Call it faith (Call it faith)
Call it fame (Call it fame)
The fantasy's the same (Uh)
[Chorus]
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can do anything
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can go anywhere
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can be anyone
So don't wake me up, don't wake me up
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can do anything
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can go anywhere
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can be anyone
So don't wake mе up, don't wake me up
[Verse 2]
Levеlin' up
Delete my history
Choose how you see me
And the future's easier
Levelin' up
I'm here, I'm winnin'
Defeat the big boss
Game over, your loss
[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling like
This ain't life
I'm choosin' fiction
Ooh woah, ooh woah
Call it faith
Call it fame
The fantasy's the same (So)
[Chorus]
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can do anything
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can go anywhere
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can be anyone
So don't wake me up, don't wake me up
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can do anything
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can go anywhere
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can be anyone
So don't wake me up, don't wake me up
[Bridge]
Will I ever, will I ever
Will I ever wake up?
Hope I never wake up (
Will I ever
)
I never get tired (
Will I ever
)
No, no, no, no, no (
Will I ever
)
No, no, no, no, no
[Chorus]
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can do anything
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can go anywhere
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can be anyone
Don't wake me up, don't wake me up
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can do anything
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can go anywhere
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can be anyone
So don't wake me up, don't wake me up
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can do anything
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can go anywhere
When I'm dreamin' tonight, I can be anyone
So don't wake me up, don't wake me up
[Outro]
Ooh, and when I'm dreamin', I can do anything
So here I go
