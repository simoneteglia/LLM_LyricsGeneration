[Intro]
(A million pieces)
[Verse 1]
I breathe in hard
Don't speak, 'cause it's like a bitter pill
You blow my mind
It makes my heart beat
Harder, harder, harder, harder, hard
The king's a clown
No one is laughing, it's not a drill
Don't look outside
The world is ending
Faster, faster, faster, faster, fast
[Pre-Chorus]
The echoes of that news ring loud
(The echoes, the echoes)
No sound can ever drown it out
(The echoes)
[Chorus]
It breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go?
Leave it till the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A million pieces
[Verse 2]
We're too far gone
Nothing I say will mean anything
Just drink, fuck, dance
Right through disaster
I don't want to talk about it now
[Pre-Chorus]
The echoes of that news ring loud
(The echoes, the echoes)
No music ever drowns it out
(The echoes)
[Chorus]
It breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go?
Leave it till the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A million pieces
[Bridge]
Get fear and loathing out your mind
And don't pull me, don't pull me down from the ceiling
[Chorus]
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces, oh
It breaks my heart into
A million pieces
If it's gonna break me
Won't you let me go?
Leave it till the morning
I don't wanna know
Breaks my heart
Breaks my heart into
A million pieces
[Outro]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A million pieces
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A million pieces
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A million pieces
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
