[Verse 1]
Johnny's on the A train
Takin' it the wrong way
Shiny on the surface
Rotten on the inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Shake, rattle, and roll
You got control, got my attention
Make me tap and scroll
You got control, got my attention
[Chorus]
You got us listening
So what you gonna do?
Now what you gonna do with it?
You got us listening
So what you gonna do?
Now what you gonna do with it?
[Post-Chorus]
Make me paranoid
Love me, hate me, fill the void
What you gonna do with it?
[Verse 2]
Sally's never outside
Got a screen to hide behind
She says she's happy on the inside
And got a lot of friends online
[Pre-Chorus]
Shake, rattle, and roll (Shake, rattle, and roll)
You got control, got my attention
Make me tap and scroll (Make me tap and scroll)
You got control, got my attention
[Chorus]
Listening, you got us listening
So what you gonna do with it?
You got us listening
So what you gonna do?
Now what you gonna do with it?
[Post-Chorus]
Make me paranoid
Love me, hate me, fill the void
What you gonna do with it?
So who am I? You decide
Inside out, you read my mind
What you gonna do with it?
