[Verse 1]
An act of kindness
is what you show to me
None more than I can take, oh, none more than I can take
Kindness
is what you showed to me
It holds me till I ache, overflow and start to break
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I got a feeling this'll shake me down
Oh, I'm kind of hoping this will turn me round
[Chorus]
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day, every day, every—
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day, every day, every day, every day
[Verse 2]
An act of kindness
is what you show to me
It caught me by surprise in this town of glass and ice
Kindness, so many people passed me by
But you warmed me to my core and you left me wanting more
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I got a feeling this'll shake me down
Oh, I'm kind of hoping this'll turn me round
Oh, I got a feeling that however small
Oh, I'm kind of hoping this will reach my soul
[Chorus]
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day, every day, every—
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day, every day, every day, every day
[Bridge]
Oh, my back's up against the wall, I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
, I feel guilty, I feel guilty
Oh, my back's up against the wall, I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
, I feel guilty, I feel guilty
[Chorus]
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day (Oh, now, now, now, now), and now it follows me every day, every day, every— (Oh, now, now, now, now, now)
And now it follows me every day, and now it follows me every day
And now it follows me every day (Oh, now, now, now, now),  and now it follows me every day, every day, every day, every day (Now it follows me everyday)
[Outro]
Oh, my back's up against the wall, I feel guilty, I feel guilty
And you want nothing in return
, I feel guilty, I feel guilty
