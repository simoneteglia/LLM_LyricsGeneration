[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
There's an albatross around your neck
All the things you've said and the things you've done
Can you carry it with no regrets?
Can you stand the person you've become?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's a light
Oh-oh-oh, there's a light
[Chorus]
Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross, shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight of living
[Verse 2]
Stepping forward out into the day
Shrugging off the dust and memory
Though it's soaring still above your head
It is out of sight and none shall see
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's a light
Oh-oh-oh, there's a light
[Chorus]
Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross, shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight of living
[Bridge]
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes
It's the sun in your eyes, in your eyes
[Chorus]
Your albatross, let it go, let it go
Your albatross, shoot it down, shoot it down
When you just can't shake the heavy weight of living
When you just can't seem to shake the weight of living
[Outro]
The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living
The weight of living
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
