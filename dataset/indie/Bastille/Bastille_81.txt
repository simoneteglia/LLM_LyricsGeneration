[Verse 1]
Hey, it's not that late
You came here for a moment of love
Just a bit of space
A change here from the city of love
[Pre-Chorus]
I wrote your name down on the hillside in my mind
I wrote your name down
[Chorus]
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
And ooh, I breathe a little deeper with every breath (With every breath)
But hope for the future got me on my knees
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
Woah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
[Verse 2]
The breeze here always stirs
The grasses of your memories alive
[Pre-Chorus]
I wrote your name down on the hillside in my mind
I wrote your name down
[Chorus]
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head (Here in my head)
And ooh, I breathe a little deeper with every breath (With every breath)
But hope for the future got me on my knees
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
Woah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
[Bridge]
Thought that I could hear you whisper softly
Can't be only me that hears the sound
But it's the ones in charge who write the history each time
[Chorus]
And oh, I keep a picture of you here in my head
And ooh, I breathe a little deeper with every breath (
I breathe a little deeper with every breath
)
But hope for the future got me on my knees
And ooh, I keep a picture of you here in my head (I keep a picture, I keep a picture)
Woah-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
