[Intro]
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voiâ€”
[Verse]
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of your dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the Soul felt its worth
The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
[Chorus]
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night that leads to morn
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
O night divine. O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
[Outro]
Hold me in your arms, hold me in your arms
I'll be buried here with you
And I'll hold in these hands, all that remains
