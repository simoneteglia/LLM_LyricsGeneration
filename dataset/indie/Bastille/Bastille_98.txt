[Verse 1]
I came to the city
Was armed to the teeth
With ideas and desires
As my only company
[Pre-Chorus]
I got the keys to the car
You got the keys to my head
You call it karma, karma
And I call it bad luck instead
[Chorus]
Well, is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or are we just craving attention?
Is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or do we just want satisfaction?
[Post-Chorus]
Is it?
Is it?
[Verse 2]
Cut to
Paradise Garage
There's paint on my hands
Making art for the masses
Out of lines off of your body
[Pre-Chorus]
I got the keys to the car
You got the keys to my head
You call it karma, karma
I call it bad luck instead
[Chorus]
Uh, is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or are we just craving attention?
Is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or do we just want satisfaction?
[Post-Chorus]
Is it?
Is it?
[Bridge]
Drugs, fame, and money (Is it?), A spotlight on our subway scene
Club 57
(Is it?), the city got the best of me
Drugs, fame, and money (Is it?), a spotlight on our subway scene
Club 57
(Is it?), the city took the best of me
[Chorus]
Is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or am I just craving attention?
Is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or do I just want satisfaction?
(Is it love?) Is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or are we just craving attention?
Is it love? Is it la-la-love?
Or do we just want satisfaction?
[Outro]
Drugs, fame, and the money (Is it?), uh
Club 57
, uh
Drugs, fame, and the money (Is it?), uh
Club 57
, uh
