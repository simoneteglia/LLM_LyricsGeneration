[Intro]
And I don't think that that's a selfish want, I really don't
I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own
When you're being stopped at every turn
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Drive around, nighttime, nowhere to go
Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes
Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this
[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time with you
[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh)
Oh, my lover, my lover, my love, we can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
(Ooh-ooh)
Don't turn over, turn over the page, we should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2]
Show me joy flower through disarray
Let's destroy each mistake that we made
Then restore the colour back to the grey
There's no pride in sharing scars to prove it
[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time with you
[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh)
Oh, my lover, my lover, my love, we can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
(Ooh-ooh)
Don't turn over, turn over the page (Ooh-ooh), we should rip it straight out
(Ooh-ooh) Then let's try our very best to fake it
(Ooh-ooh, ooh)
[Bridge]
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness
[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh)
Oh, my lover, my lover, my love, we can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
(Ooh-ooh)
Don't turn over, turn over the page, we should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it
[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh) Oh, my lover, my lover, my love (My love; Ooh-ooh), we can never go back (Go back; Ooh-ooh)
We can only do our best to recreate (Do our best to recreate; Ooh-ooh, ooh)
Don't turn over, turn over the page, we should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it
