[Intro: Spoken]
Tragedy, private, comfort of strangers
Pressure, pride, comfort of strangers
Tragedy, private comfort of strangers
Pressure, pride, comfort of strangers
Tragedy, private comfort of strangers
[Verse 1]
Find comfort in a stranger
Give me something unfamiliar
Between these sheets let's hide away
One light on in the city
We lose ourselves completely
Raindrops fill the alleyways
[Pre-Chorus]
As the world falls down around us
Give me something to remember
[Chorus]
I am holding on
In the back of my mind for dear life, dear life
Holding on
In the back of my mind for dear life, dear life
Oh, I, oh, I
I am holding on for dear life
Oh, I, oh, I
I am holding on for dear life
[Post-Chorus: Spoken]
Tragedy, private, comfort of strangers
[Verse 2]
Keep looking for distraction
Tonight we live in fiction
In your arms I hide away
Two bodies in the darkness
Not hard to find the weakness
Keep the morning light at bay
[Pre-Chorus]
As the world falls down around us
Give me something to remember
[Chorus]
I am holding on
In the back of my mind for dear life, dear life
Holding on
In the back of my mind for dear life, dear life
Oh, I, oh, I
I am holding on for dear life
Oh, I, oh, I
I am holding on for dear life
[Bridge]
When the morning comes, will it feel the same?
Will we feel the same? Will we feel the same?
When the morning comes, will it feel the same?
Will we feel the same? Will we feel the same?
[Chorus]
I am holding on
In the back of my mind for dear life, dear life
Holding on
In the back of my mind for dear life, dear life
Oh, I, oh, I
I am holding on for dear life
Oh, I, oh, I
I am holding on for dear life
[Outro]
I am holding on to you tonight for dear life
I am holding on to you tonight for dear life
I am holding on to you tonight for dear life
I am holding on to you tonight for dear life
