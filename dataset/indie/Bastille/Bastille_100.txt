[Verse 1]
I could only be myself with you around
Oh, with you around
But now there's nothing left for me to think about
Oh, to think about
[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts like hell to be torn apart
And it hurts like hell to be thrown around
[Chorus]
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
[Verse 2]
You stamped with a heavy tread and left your mark
Oh, your mark on me
The space you used to fill is now this great black hole
Oh, you're out of sight but not out of mind
[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts like hell to be torn apart
And it hurts like hell to be thrown around
[Chorus]
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
