[Verse 1]
Just another brain on the campus, just another man in the field
Just another tall pile of papers making it crowded in here
Someone else's work in your theses, someone else's words in your mouth
Someone else's hard work and research taking you up in the world
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, never leave me out
I'm standing by the sidelines
Oh, never leave me out
I'm standing by
[Chorus]
I watch it all from afar, Heaven, help me
I watch it all fall apart, Heaven, help me
Help me, help me, help me, help me
I watch it all from afar, Heaven, help me
[Verse 2]
Just another brain on the campus, just another set of ideas
Just another theory in motion waiting there for you to steal
It must be so lonely, knowing what you know
Man, it must be lonely, keeping it on the low
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, never leave me out
I'm standing by the sidelines
Oh, never leave me out
I'm standing by
[Chorus]
I watch it all from afar, Heaven, help me
I watch it all fall apart, Heaven help me
Help me, help me, help me, help me
I watch it all from afar, Heaven, help me
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
I watch it all from afar, Heaven, help me
I watch it all fall apart, Heaven, help me
Help me, help me, help me, help me
I watch it all fall apart, Heaven, help me
