[Verse 1]
When you got the call that no one wants to have
Sick of hospitals to paper over cracks
You weren't scared at all, but never turned away
Well, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em all
'Stop!'
Stop signs, run 'em, bills, don't pay 'em, who would care at all?
Burn your money,
ain't worth nothing on your curtain call
[Chorus]
There'll be no bad days, there'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days, you'll have no more bad days
When you're gone, gone, there'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days
[Verse 2]
So, your future's lost, but they can't take your past
And you said, "No tears 'round here anymore"
But I ain't crying, that's you crying
Well, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em all
[Chorus]
'Cause
there'll be no bad days, there'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days, you'll have no more bad days
When you're gone, gone, there'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Stop!
There'll be no bad days, there'll be no bad days
There'll be no bad days, you'll have no more bad days
When you're gone, gone, there'll be no bad days
You'll have no more bad days
[Outro]
No more bad days, no bad days (Bad days)
(Gone, gone)
There'll be no bad days, you'll have no more bad days
