[Verse 1]
I got two open eyes, now I'm on the other side
Happy in my second life, headset on
I could be anything, let me be your Midas king
Think of all the joy I'd bring, touching everything
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been trying to catch a fever dream
In the desert, give me deep blue sea
We ain't nothing but the things we've seen
Plug me in
[Chorus]
So give me the future, it's golden and bright
Catch a fever dream in the flash of thе lights
Now nothing is certain and the song isn't done
Thе new melodies rise up with the Sun
Give me the future
[Verse 2]
Suddenly found my feet,
dreaming of electric sheep
Just a little space to breathe, feeling
joy serene
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been trying to catch a fever dream
In the desert, give me deep blue sea
We ain't nothing but the things we've seen
Plug me in
[Chorus]
So give me the future, it's golden and bright
Catch a fever dream in the flash of the lights
Now nothing is certain and the song isn't done
The new melodies rise up with the Sun
[Post-Chorus]
I tasted endless love that takes control
Endless love and I wanted more (So give me the future)
I tasted endless love that takes control
Endless love and I wanted more (Just give me the future)
[Bridge]
Why would we leave?
Why would we leave?
Miles and miles of fake beauty
It's good for you, it's good for me
Why would we leave?
Why would we leave? Uh
[Chorus]
So give me the future, it's golden and bright
Catch a fever dream in the flash of the lights
Now nothing is certain and the song isn't done
The new melodies rise up with the Sun
[Outro]
I tasted endless love that takes control
Endless love and I wanted more (So give me the future)
I tasted endless love that takes control
Endless love and I wanted more
Catch a fever dream in the flash of the lights
