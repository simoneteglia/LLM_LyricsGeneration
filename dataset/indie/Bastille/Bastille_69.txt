[Intro]
Come on, come on, don’t stop a-running with me
Come on, come on, don’t stop a-running…
[Verse 1]
He’s throwing his hands up to the sky
How many more ways are there to say this?
He’s wondering how many more times
Will we all bear witness
[Pre-Chorus]
And can’t you feel the temperature rising?
‘Cause we’ve never felt a heat like this before
And can’t you see it on the horizon?
Then he opens up his question to the floor
[Chorus]
“Would it keep you awake if it all just didn't seem so far away?
‘Cause it keeps me awake trying to work this out until my dying day
It’s always you standing in our way
It’s always you that is leading us astray”
[Verse 2]
It takes a big man to cry on screen
Delivering words that fall on deaf ears
It’s such a big wheel to try and turn
But in his final hour, it’s worth it
[Pre-Chorus]
And can’t you feel the temperature rising?
‘Cause we’ve never felt a heat like this before
And can’t you see it on the horizon?
Then he opens up his question to the floor
[Chorus]
“Would it keep you awake if it all just didn't seem so far away?
'Cause it keeps me awake trying to work this out until my dying day
It’s always you standing in our way
It’s always you that’s leading us astray”
[Bridge]
Come on, come on, don’t stop a-running with me
Come on, come on, don’t stop a-running
Come on, come on, don't stop a-running with me
Come on, come on, don't stop a-running...
[Chorus]
Would it keep you awake if the waters rise and took your house away?
Would it keep you awake if the gun you love was turned at you one day?
It’s always you standing in our way
It’s always you that is leading us astray
You are always, you are always leading us astray
