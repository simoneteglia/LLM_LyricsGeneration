[Verse 1]
Skipping town, down to Mexico
Lipstick on in the Thunderbird
, let's roll
Drive right off of the world
Huh, leave your job and your gaslight man
Modern life was a big letdown, we're bored
Felt like a brick in a wall
[Pre-Chorus]
"
Days like these, you wanna get away
Close our eyes, pretend we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?"
She said to me
[Chorus]
"Days like these, you wanna get away
Closе our eyes, pretеnd we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?"
She said to me
[Verse 2]
Runaways under big blue skies
Desert winds, yeah, we made headlines when you showed
Him what it means to say no
[Pre-Chorus]
"Days like these, you wanna get away
Close our eyes, pretend we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?"
She said to me
[Chorus]
"Days like these, you wanna get away
Close our eyes, pretend we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?"
[Outro]
And suddenly we're Thelma and Louise
You said, "Let's get the hell right out of here"
Oh, can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?
Days like these, we wanna get away
