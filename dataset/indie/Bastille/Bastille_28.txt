[Verse 1]
I can feel your eyes in the back of my head
Burning, burning, burning
Floating through the room as the hairs on my arms are
Rising, rising, rising
I'm chemically drawn closer to you
Eyes wide, eyes wide open
Will you be my future or just an escape?
Love me, love me, love me
[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never get to Heaven on a night like this
[Chorus]
Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are
[Verse 2]
Pulling at my t-shirt, your hands everywhere
Rising, rising, rising
As you trip and fall, dragging me up the stairs
What's your, what's your name, now?
[Pre-Chorus]
You try to get to Heaven on a night like this
But you, you never get to Heaven on a night like this
[Chorus]
Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are
[Bridge]
The lights, the lights, the lights
They cut a path across the room
The lights, the lights, the lights
A blinding look from me to you
And I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to Heaven
I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to Heaven
[Chorus]
Those nights when your friends are gone
When you're holding on for someone to leave with
Those nights when you crave someone
To be there at dawn, to wake with, 'cause aren't we all just
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
Looking for somebody you can wake up with?
Looking for a little bit of hope these days?
We are, we are
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
From my brain
