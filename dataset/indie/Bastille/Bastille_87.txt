[Intro]
Stop the world, I want to get off
Lucid dreams, I can't get enough
Give me the future, give me confidence, give me...
[Verse 1]
Cyberlove
in an anxious age
Lord above need to get me laid
Had a taste of Euphoria
Who could blame me for wanting more?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me passion, give me violence, give me confidence
Give me something new to feel, uh
Now us freaks and geeks can rule, the world havе everything
Doesn't mattеr if it's real
[Chorus]
In my head, in my head, I escape with you
When my dreams run away, run away with you
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
[Verse 2]
Share our souls on the Internet
Total recall
all the dumb regrets
Breaking hearts in a brand new way
Same old humans making new mistakes
[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me passion, give me violence, give me confidence
Give me something new to feel, uh (Give me something new to feel)
And now us freaks and geeks can rule, the world have everything
Doesn't matter if it's real
[Chorus]
In my head, in my head, I escape with you
When my dreams run away, run away with you
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
Why would I stay awake, stay awake, stay awake?
[Bridge]
Stop the world, I wanna get off
Lucid dreams, I can't get enough
Stop the world, I wanna get off
Lucid dreams, I can't get enough
Stop the world, I wanna get off
Lucid dreams, I can't get enough
Stop the world, I wanna get off
Lucid dreams, I can't get enough
Stop the world, I wanna get off
Lucid dreams, I can't get enough, can't get enough
[Chorus]
In my head, in my head, I escape with you
Let my dreams run away, run away with you
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
Why would I stay awake, stay awake?
Why would I stay awake, stay awake, stay awake?
