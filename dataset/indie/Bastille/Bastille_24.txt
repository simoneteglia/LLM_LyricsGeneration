[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Walking out into the dark, cutting out a different path
Lead by a beating heart
All the people of the town cast their eyes right to the ground
In matters of the heart
[Pre-Chorus]
The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path up on the ground
You ran into the night; you can't be found
[Chorus]
But this is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
[Verse 2]
Summer evening, breezes blew,
drawing voices deep from you
Lead by your beating heart
What a year and what a night, what terrifying final sights
Put out your beating heart
[Pre-Chorus]
The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path up on the ground
You ran into the night; you can't be found
[Chorus]
But, this is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
[Bridge]
If you had your gun
Would you shoot it at the sky? Why?
To see where it would fall
Or will you come down at all?
If you had your gun
Would you shoot it at the sky? Why?
To see where your bullet would fall
Or will you come down at all?
[Chorus]
This is your heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
This is your racing heart
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Pumps through your veins
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
