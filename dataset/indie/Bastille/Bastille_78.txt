[Intro]
[Verse 1]
I know it's been a week, I know it's not been long
But I'm already past the point of no return
I've got you on a loop, I've got you in my head
A chemical reaction, a flashback to your bed
[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting for your call
I can feel my body shaking
Calm before the storm
Let it take me, I embrace it
[Chorus]
You stirred somethin' in me
I admit defeat
Won't be thinking 'bout anything at all tonight, but
[Post-Chorus]
You, oh, oh
Anything at all, but
You, oh, oh
Anything at all, but ya
[Verse 2]
So tell me when you're out
And tell me where to go
Of course, you have my body
But now you've got my soul
You drive me to distraction, run me off the road
You crash into my mind, I'm ready to explode
[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting for your call
I can feel my body shaking
Calm before the storm
Let it take me, I embrace it
[Chorus]
You stirred somethin' in me
I admit defeat
Won't be thinking 'bout anything at all tonight, so
Wrap yourself 'round me
I admit defeat
Won't be thinking 'bout anything at all tonight but
[Post-Chorus]
You, oh, oh
Anything at all, but
You, oh, oh
Anything at all, 'cause
[Bridge]
You're the only voice in my head
I can hear you speaking, louder than I'm thinking
Hang on every word that you said
Drive me to distraction, drive me to distraction
You're the only voice in my head
I can hear you speaking, louder than I'm thinking
Hang on every word that you said
Drive me to distraction, drive me to distraction
[Chorus]
You stirred somethin' in me
I admit defeat
Won't be thinking 'bout anything at all tonight, so
Wrap yourself 'round me
I admit defeat
Won't be thinking 'bout anything at all tonight but
[Post-Chorus]
You, oh, oh
Anything at all, but
You, oh, oh
Anything  at all, but
[Outro]
Anything at all, but
Anything at all, but you
Anything at all, but you
