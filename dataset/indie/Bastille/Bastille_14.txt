[Verse 1]
You go sleep with the fishes
There's no room for you here
There's no room for you here
Wrap your teeth around the pavement
'Cause your body's a message
Send my regards to hell
[Chorus 1]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
"This is my body and soul here"
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
"You've got the power and control"
Don't pin it all on me
Don't pin it all on me!
[Verse 2]
You've been granted three wishes
Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son
I can hear your pulse racing from here
Sitting next to this gun beats your heart in your mouth
[Chorus 1]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
"This is my body and soul here"
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
"You've got the power to control"
Don't pin it all on me
Don't pin it all on me!
[Bridge]
Oh, blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Oh, blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Oh, blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
Oh, blame, blame, blame (I got you, I got you)
[Chorus 2]
Fall upon your knees, sing:
"This is my body and soul here"
Crawl and beg and plead, sing:
"You've got the power to control here
This is my body and this is my soul!”
Fall upon your knees, sing:
“This is my body and soul
Don't pin it all on me
Don't pin it all on me!"
[Outro]
Don't pin it all on me
Don't pin it all on me
