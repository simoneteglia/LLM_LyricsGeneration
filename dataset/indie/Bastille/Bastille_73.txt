[Verse 1]
Feels like we danced into a nightmare
We're living 1984
If doublethink's no longer fiction
We'll dream of Huxley's Island shores
[Pre-Chorus]
Waking life, it lets us down
So close your eyes and melt away
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, I can dream away
Change what I like and go back to the future again
In the middle of the night, gonna scream your name
Bring you to life
then go back to the future again
[Post-Chorus]
In the middle of the night, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
[Verse 2]
Now that reality's distorted
Can we just Blade Run-Run away
Back into some imagined future
Let's tap our heels three times and pray
[Pre-Chorus]
Uh,
waking life, it lets us down
So close your eyes and melt away
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, I can dream away
Change what I like and go back to the future again
In the middle of the night, gonna scream your name
Bring you to life
then go back to the future again
[Post-Chorus]
In the middle of the night, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
In the middle of the night, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
[Bridge]
Hey, uh, uh
Uh, take me back to the future
Uh, take me back to the future
Uh, take me back to the future
Uh, take me back to the future
Uh, let's go back to the future
Uh, let's go back to the future
[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, can I dream away?
Bring you to life
then go back to the future again
[Post-Chorus]
In the middle of the night, ah-ooh, ah-ooh (In the middle of the night)
In the middle of the night, ah-ooh, ah-ooh
