[Verse 1]
Fourth place anthem
playing tonight, on a broken radio
I thought we reached the mountaintop, but now, we just feel so low
The sky is breaking open, we keep hoping, in the distance we'll see a glow
Lightning, light our way 'til the black sky turns back to indigo
[Chorus]
We can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
We can make it, baby
Please don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
I never quit on you
[Verse 2]
We were born in paradise, beneath a poisoned sky
Under a bad sign, the micro-age of Gemini
And we are still unlearning, tirеs are burning in the middle of Rodеo Drive
You know that we've been beat down and broken, but now we can testify
[Chorus]
We can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
We can make it, baby
Please don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
I'll never quit on you
[Outro: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
It's not up to you
Some you win, some you lose (
When the lightning comes
)
You don't get to choose
Some you win, some you lose (
When the lightning comes
)
One, two, three, four
