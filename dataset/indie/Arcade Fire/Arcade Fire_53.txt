[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hear the noises on TV
I don't want the salesmen coming after me
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more
I don't want it faster, I don't want it free
I don't wanna show you what they've done to me
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more
I don't wanna choose black or blue
I don't wanna see what they've done to you
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more
[Chorus]
Because the tide is high
And it's rising still
,
And I don't wanna see it at my windowsill
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna give 'em my name and address
I don't wanna see what happens next
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more
I don't wanna live with my father's debt
You can't forgive what you can't forget
I don't wanna live in my father's house no more
I don't wanna fight in a holy war
,
I don't want the salesmen knocking at my door
I don't wanna live in America no more
[Chorus]
Because the tide is high
And it's rising still
And I don't want to see it at my windowsill
I don't want to see it at my windowsill
I don't want to see it at my windowsill
I don't want to see it at my windowsill
[Verse 3]
MTV, what have you done to me?
Save my soul, set me free!
Set me free! What have you done to me?
I can't breathe! I can't see!
World War III, when are you coming for me?
Been kicking up sparks, to set the flames free
The windows are locked now, so what'll it be?
A house on fire, or the rising sea?
[Chorus]
Why is the night so still?
Why did I take the pill?
Because I don't want to see it at my windowsill!
[Outro]
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
(Don't want to see it at my windowsill!)
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
(Don't want to see it at my windowsill!)
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
(Don't want to see it at my-)
(Don't want to see it at my windowsill!)
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
(Don't want to see it at my windowsill!)
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
(Don't want to see it at my windowsill!)
Don't want to see it at my windowsill!
