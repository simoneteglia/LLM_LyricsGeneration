[Verse 1]
Summer's gone and so are you
See the sky electrocute
A thousand boys that look like you
Cover my eyes electric blue
[Refrain]
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out I don't know shit
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out
[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 2]
A thousand girls that look like me
Staring out at the open sea
Repeat the words until they're true
Cover my eyes electric blue
[Refrain]
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out I don't know shit
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out
[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 3]
Now you've got me so confused
'Cause I don't know how to sing your blues
Jesus Christ, what could I do?
I don't know how to sing your blues
[Refrain]
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it, but I found out
[Outro]
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
