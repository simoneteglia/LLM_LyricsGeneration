[Intro: Jonathan Ross Sample]
(We have fabulous music from the fantastic)
Arcade Fire!
[Verse 1: Win Butler]
Lights
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You miss it if you don't
You miss it if you
[Chorus: Win Butler]
Don't already know
Already know
Already know
Already know
Already know
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
When your love is right
When your love is right
You can't sleep at night
You've been sleeping just fine
But when your love is bad
When your love is bad
I don't know why you're so sad
But it's time to go
[Chorus: Win Butler]
You already know
Already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
Already know
[Verse 3: Win Butler]
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move it so slow?
You missed it, you know
You missed it
[Chorus: Win Butler]
You already know
Already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
[Bridge: Win Butler &
RÃ©gine Chassagne
]
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad
When you already know
(Already know)
[Outro: Win Butler &
Jonathan Ross Sample
]
Oh, oh
Already know
Oh, it's time to go
Well she said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"
(You already know)
Well, well then he said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I really know?"
(Already know)
She said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"...
Haha, haha
Arcade Fire, ladies and gentlemen!
