[Verse 1]
Here
In my place and time
And here in my own skin
I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by
Standing under a night sky
Tomorrow means nothing
[Verse 2]
I
Was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when
I heard the song from the speaker of a passing car
Been praying to a dying star
The memory's fading
I can almost remember singing
La la-la la-la la-la
La-la la-la la-la la-la
[Verse 3]
We
Watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see
Something was ending
Are you through pretending
We saw the signs in the suburbs?
[Verse 4]
You
Could never predict it
That it could see through you
Kasparov, Deep Blue, 1996
Your mind's playing tricks now
Show is over so take a bow
We're living in the shadows of the
La la-la la-la la-la
Oh, la la-la la-la la-la, ooo
[Bridge]
Hey
Put the cellphone down for a while
In the night there is something wild
Can you hear it breathing?
Hey
Put the laptop down for a while
In the night there is something wild
I feel it, it's leaving me
[Outro]
La-la la-la la-la la-la
La-la la-la la-la la-la
La-la la-la la-la la-la
La-la la-la la-la la-la
