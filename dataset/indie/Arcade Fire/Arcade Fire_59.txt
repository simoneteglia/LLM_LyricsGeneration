[Verse 1: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
I'm serving time
All for a crime I did commit
You want the truth?
You know I'd do it all again
Left for dead
,
Heaven is only in my head!
(
In my head
)
[Verse 2: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
I heard a voice
Calling from down inside a well
"See that silver shine?"
She said to come claim what was mine
So down I fell
Down into the water black
My prison cell
Only the moon was shining back!
(
Was shining back
)
[Chorus: Win Butler]
If I seem lost, well, I weighed the cost
And chose my crime--
Now it's mine, all mine!
[Verse 3: Win Butler,
Régine Chassagne
and
Both Win and Régine
]
I heard the voice
Calling from just outside the well
She said "
You fool
,
Now that you know your end is near
;
You always fall
For what you desire or what you fear!
" (
What you fear
)
[Bridge: Win Butler]
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse
,
If you leave, them ships are going to wreck
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse
,
The lions and the lambs ain’t sleeping yet
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse
,
Can you see the funny side? The ships are going to wreck
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse
,
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain’t sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain’t sleeping yet
[Outro: Régine Chassagne]
(Sleeping yet)
(Sleeping yet)
(Sleeping yet)
