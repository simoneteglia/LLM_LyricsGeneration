[Verse 1]
Woman of a certain age
Are are to feel that they've gotta change
Some of them change their faces
But they don't smile the same
Some of them take night courses
Some of them get divorces
As the world gets strange
It's time for a change
[Chorus]
Go on, let your men get strange, mama
Go on, let the world get strange
Never change
[Verse 2]
Women of the world unite
It's all the boys, they just wanna fight
And women of the world are born
To older boys little wars
Mother, sister, daughter
The boys are just cannon fodder
It's time to take the reigns
And lead us away from the strange
[Chorus]
Go on and let your men get strange, mama
Go on let the world get strange
But never change
Never change
Never change
