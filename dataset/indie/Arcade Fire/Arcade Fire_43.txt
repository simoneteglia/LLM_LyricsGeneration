[Verse 1]
The summer that I broke my arm
I waited for your letter
I have no feeling for you now
Now that I know you better
I wish that I could have loved you then
Before our age was through
And before a world war does with us
Whatever it will do
I dreamt I drove home to Houston
On a highway that was underground
There was no light that we could see
As we listened to the sound of the engine failing
[Chorus]
I feel like I’ve been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside
Of a private prison
[Verse 2]
You never trust a millionaire
Quoting the Sermon on the Mount
I used to think I was not like them
But I’m beginning to have my doubts, my doubts about it
When you’re hiding underground
The rain can’t get you wet
But do you think your righteousness
Can pay the interest on your debt? I have my doubts about it
[Chorus]
I feel like I’ve been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside
Of a private prison
I feel like I’ve been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by and by, as I hide inside
Of my private prison
