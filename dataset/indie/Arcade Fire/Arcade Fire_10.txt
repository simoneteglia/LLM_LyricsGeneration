[Chorus]
My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
,
But my mind holds the key
My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
,
But my mind holds the key
[Verse 1]
I'm standing on a stage
Of fear and self-doubt
It's a hollow play
,
But they'll clap anyway
[Chorus]
My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
,
But my mind holds the key
[Interlude]
You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key
[Verse 2]
I'm living in an age
That calls darkness light
Though my language is dead
Still the shapes fill my head
I'm living in an age
Whose name I don't know
Though the fear keeps me moving
,
Still my heart beats so slow
[Chorus]
My body is a cage that keeps me
From dancing with the one I love
But my mind holds the key
[Interlude]
You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key
My body is a...
[Verse 3]
My body is a cage
We take what we're given
Just because you've forgotten
,
That don't mean you're forgiven
I'm living in an age
That screams my name at night
,
But when I get to the doorway
There's no one in sight
I'm living in an age
That laughs
When I'm dancing
With the one I love
,
But my mind holds the key
[Interlude]
You're standing next to me
My mind holds the key
[Outro]
Set my spirit free
Set my spirit free
Set my body free
Set my body free
Set my spirit free
Set my body free
