[Verse 1]
In my dreams you're dying
It wakes me up, and I can't stop crying
I just wanna live forever
Keep my promises, keep it together
In my dreams you're living
Open your eyes, and I wake up forgiven
Just a little something to thin the blood
How can I live with so much love?
Singing
[Chorus]
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if you don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, ain't got no plans
Boys and girls got all the answers
Men and women keep growing their cancers
Singing
[Verse 2]
In my dreams we're kissing
It wakes me up, but you've gone missing
Born so close, but we grow apart
And all the sickness starts in the heart
In my dreams you're dying
It wakes me up, and I can't stop crying
'Cause it's a date night, dead-eyed American dream
And it leaves you baby, if you let it leave
Singing
[Chorus]
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, take my hand
We can walk if you don't feel like flying
We can live, I don't feel like dying
Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan
Come on baby, ain't got no plans
Just a little something to thin the blood
How can I live with so much love?
Singing
