[Intro: Win Butler]
Those monitors are a little bit hot
Uh, sorry about that
Thank you guys so much for coming out, yeah
Oh man
Do you like Rock and Roll music?
‘Cause I don’t know if I do
[Verse 1: Win Butler]
Is anything as strange as a normal person?
Is anyone as cruel as a normal person?
Waiting after school for you
They want to know if you
If you're normal too
Well, are you?
Are you?
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
Well
I'm so confused
Am I a normal person? You know
I can't tell if I'm a normal person, it's true
I think I'm cool enough
But am I cruel enough?
Am I cruel enough
For you?
[Chorus: Win Butler]
And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now
I know
[Verse 3: Win Butler]
They take their tea at two, all the
The normal people, they do
They burn the jungle down
While they were sleeping, it grew
You dream in English now
In proper English, look how
You're just the same as me
It's through
[Chorus: Win Butler]
And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
‘Til everyone is normal now
I know
[Post-Chorus: Win Butler]
If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now
Mama don't make me go
[Bridge: Win Butler]
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it...No!
[Chorus: Win Butler]
And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now
I know
[Post-Chorus: Win Butler]
If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now
[Outro:
Regine Chassagne
& Win Butler]
Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together
You can change us, just where should you start?
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
Like you
How do you do?
How do you do?
Thank you
