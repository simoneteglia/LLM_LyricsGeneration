[Verse 1]
Gonna make a record in the month of May
In the month of May, in the month of May
Gonna make a record in the month of May
When the violent wind blows the wires away
The month of May, it’s a violent thing
In the city, their hearts start to sing
Well, some people sing, it sounds like they’re screaming
I used to doubt it but now I believe it
Month of May, everybody’s in love
Then the city was hit from above
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
A violent wind blew the wires away
[Interlude]
We were shocked in the suburbs!
[Verse 2]
Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
I said, some things are pure, and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
So young, so young
So much pain for someone so young
Well, I know it’s heavy, I know it ain’t light
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight?
[Verse 3]
First they built the road (First they built the road)
Then they built the town (Then they built the town)
That’s why we’re still driving around
And around and around and around and around
And around and around and around
(And around and around and around and around)
2009, 2010
Wanna make a record how I felt then
When we stood outside in the month of May
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away
If I die in the month of May
Let the wind take my body away, yeah
Wish I may, I wish I might
Don’t lay me down there with my arms folded tight
[Chorus]
Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away
Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away
Gonna start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires
The wires away
