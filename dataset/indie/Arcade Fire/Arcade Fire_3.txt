[Verse 1: Win Butler]
Take the makeup
Off your eyes
I've got to see you
Hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up
Comes the silence
I'm talking to you
You say you're over it
But I know
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
I thought I knew you
You thought you knew me
But now that you do
It's not so easy now
That I know
[Chorus: Win Butler,
with Régine Chassagne
]
You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno
Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know that we know
Never know what we know
[Verse 3: Win Butler, &
Régine Chassagne
]
And all your makeup
Just take it all off
I've got to find you
Before the line is lost
I know I hurt you
I won't deny it
When I reach for you
You say, "
I'm over it.
"
But I know
[Chorus: Win Butler]
You can cry, I won’t go
You can scream, I won’t go
Every man that you know
Would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno
Oh, I know they hurt you so
They don’t know what I know
It’s so little that we know
But the cup it overflows
Little boys with their porno
But this is their world
Where can we go?
[Post-Chorus: Win Butler]
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Could you see me?
[Bridge: Win Butler]
You can cry, I won't go
You can scream, I won't go
Little boys with their porno
Little boys with their porno
Makes me feel like something's wrong
It's the only world we know
Yeah, something's wrong
Little boys with their porno
[Outro: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
And boys they learn
Some selfish shit
Until the girl
Won't put up with it
On and on and on we go
I just have to know
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
(
I’m not over it
)
You say love is real
(
I’m not over it
)
Like a disease
(
I’m not over it
)
Come on tell me, please
I'm not over it
I'm not over it
Wait
