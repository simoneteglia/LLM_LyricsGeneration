[Chorus:]
Better get right, before you die
Better get right
Better get right, before you die
Better get right
[Chorus]
Better get right, before you die
Better get right
Better get right, before you die
Better get right
[Verse 1:]
â€˜Cause you can't take me down with you
Where you're going to
No you can't take me down with you
Where you going to?
[Verse 2]
If I ever (Ever) get stronger than
You could ever
Yeah, forever (Ever) get stronger than
You could ever
Huh, give me a chance
[Chorus:]
Better get right
Better get right
[Instrumental Outro]
