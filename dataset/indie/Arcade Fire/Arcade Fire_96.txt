[Verse 1]
You want to be set apart?
Burn all of your art repair the wasteful part
I'm a vampire in a forest fire
Hey! we all got to keep warm
Driving towards the storm
[Verse 2]
Your father was a pervert
Face down in the dirt
He taught you how to hurt
My father was a miner
who lived in the suburbs
Let's live in the suburbs
If I let where I'm from burn I can never return!
[Verse 3]
My brother reads you and me his new poetry
How embarrassing
Your sister pours the gasoline
I'll fix your meals
While your burns heal!
[Verse 4]
Find a house you don't have to rebuild
Stone by stone, brick by brick, nail by nail my father never meant to leave me this
Let this love last
I drive too fast
Said I'd return if I'd ever cared
But there's no interstate I find to take me there
