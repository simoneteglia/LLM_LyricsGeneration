I. Last Dance
[Verse 1: Win Butler]
One last dance
Here at the end of the empire
Makes me cry
Watching the moon on the ocean
Where California used to be
It's not half bad, oh
Spend half your life being sad
Well, don't be scared, oh-oh
Just chronically impaired, oh-oh
Just take my hand, oh-oh
Standing at the end of the American Empire
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
One last song
Here at the end of the movie
They seemed so sure
At lеast that's the way I remembеr the war
When New York used to be
It's not half bad, oh-oh
Spending half your life being sad, woah
Don't you weep, oh-oh
Half your life fast asleep, oh-oh
Feeling uninspired, oh
Standing at the end of the American Empire
II. Last Round
[Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
And we know that it's time to go
Heard the news on the radio
One last round before we go
Through the pale atmospheric glow
And the oxygen's getting low
Sing a song that we used to know
One last round before we go
One last round before we go
III. Leave The Light On
[Intro: Win Butler]
(So sad)
[Verse 1: Win Butler]
Didn't use to get high
Didn't use to drink and I
Didn't use to think I
Could ever dream about losing you
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
Didn't use to get low
This time of night and I
Didn't use to walk home
In the morning light
Without you
Without you
[Verse 3: Win Butler]
Didn't use to get high
Didn't use to drink
Didn't use to think I
Could ever dream about losing you, you
But I do
[Chorus: Win Butler]
It’s you and I, it’s do or die
Suicide mission, baby by my side
We got one life and half of it’s gone
You know I can’t sleep with the television on
[Outro: Win Butler]
Didn't use to get high
With you by my side
(Leave the light on)

I unsubscribe
This ain't no way of life
I don't believe the hype
She unsubscribes
She unsubscribes
She says "There's diamonds in your eyes"
High on her own supply
She says "The air we're breathin' is from an exhaust pipe
Just a prototype"

'Cause this inferno's hyperdrive (

The algorithm prescribed
Do you feel alright?

Your heroes are selling you underwear
And little white pills for your despair
Little black space between the stars
Dream about crashing expensive cars
One Christ child and one on the way
Why don't we name her
Sagittarius A*
What a pretty name

The clothes don't fit me right (

We'll see one day
What's on the other side
