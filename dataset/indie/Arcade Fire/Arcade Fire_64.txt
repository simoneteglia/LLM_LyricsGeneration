[Verse 1]
You want to get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
And fill the bathtub up
You want to say goodbye
To your oldest friends
[Pre-Chorus]
With the good God damn
With the good God damn
[Verse 2]
Lay out your clothes
It's time to go
It's always darkest before the dawn
The sun never shows
I could say goodbye
To your oldest friends
[Chorus]
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Maybe there's a good God
Damn
[Verse 3]
Let me get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
Fill the bathtub up
You could say goodbye
To your so-called friends
[Chorus]
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Could there be a good God? Damn
Could there be a good God? Damn
Well, maybe there's a good God, damn
Well, maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God
If He made you
[Outro]
If He made you
