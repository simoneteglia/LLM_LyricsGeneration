[Verse 1]
The red lights mean you're leaving
The white ones mean returning
Tell me how this story ends
And I'll keep them fires burning
[Verse 2]
The headlights look like diamonds
The taillights burn like coals
Tell me how this story ends
Before the fires go cold
[Verse 3]
The countryside's deserted
There's no one on the farms
The suburbs all are sleeping
The earthquakes set off car alarms
[Verse 4]
All after all now we aware
All after all the time we share
There's so much fears of world
Hopes of world, tears of world
