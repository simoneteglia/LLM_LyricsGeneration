[Intro: Announcer]
You officers that are stationed in front of the stage behind the barricade: You will go to Mr. Maury Shapiro, the first aid man, and he will furnish you with earplugs. So as to keep you from having a headache. If he runs out of earplugs, he has got some cotton. We will not allow any dancing, running up and down the aisle. Is that clear with everybody?
[Verse 1: Win Butler]
'Cause I don't wanna be born, born again
But not right now, please don't take me yet
But God said "Son, it's time to go
And when you'll return, I don't know just yet."
But even stars, they die, when they get old
The precious ones that we used to hold
So if you gon' shoot better hit your mark
Send that arrow, send it through my heart
My heart
[Chorus: Win Butler]
He said "This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away."
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
She said "But Joan of Arc, a walk in the dark"
She said "I've seen how the world ends
First they love you, then they kill you
Then they love you again
And again
Again."
[Chorus: Win Butler]
She said
"This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away."
She said
"This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away."
[Verse 3: Win Butler]
Jesus Christ, what did you do
To deserve what they done to you?
Jesus Christ, what did you do
To deserve what they done to you?
[Bridge: Win Butler]
Come on downtown
See what we got, we got the riot
Oh, come on downtown
And see what we got, we got the riot
We know something ain't right
We know something ain't right
I said, "Come on downtown
See what we got, we got the riot
We got a riot."
[Outro: Jonathan Ross sample]
Hahaha... ha ha... Arcade Fire ladies and gentlemen!
