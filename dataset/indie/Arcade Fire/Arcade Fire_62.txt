[Verse 1]
In an ocean of noise
,
I first heard your voice
,
Ringing like a bell
,
As if I had a choice, oh well!
Left in the morning
While you were fast asleep
,
Into an ocean of violence
,
A world of empty streets
[Chorus]
You've got your reasons
,
And me, I've got mine
,
But all the reasons I gave
Were just lies to buy myself some time
[Verse 2]
In an ocean of noise
,
I first heard your voice
Now who here among us
Still believes in choice?
Not I!
No way of knowing
What any man will do
,
An ocean of violence
Between me and you
[Chorus]
You've got your reasons
,
And me, I've got mine
,
But all the reasons I gave
Were just lies to buy myself some time
[Outro]
I'm gonna work it out
'Cause time won’t work it out
I'm gonna work it out
'Cause time won’t work it out for you
I'm gonna work it on out
'Cause time won't work it out for you
I'm gonna work it out
'Cause time won’t work it out
I'm gonna work it on out
