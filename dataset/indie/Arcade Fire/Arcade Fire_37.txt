[Verse 1]
Abraham took Isaac's hand
And led him to the lonesome hill
While his daughter hid and watched
She dared not breathe she was so still
Just as the angel cried for the slaughter
Abraham's daughter raised her voice
[Verse 2]
Then the angel asked her what her
Name was she said "I have none"
Then he asked how can this be
My father never gave me one
[Verse 3]
And with his sword up, raised for the slaughter
Abraham's daughter raised her bow
How darest you child defy your father
You better let young Isaac go
