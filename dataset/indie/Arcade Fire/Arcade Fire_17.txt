[Verse 1]
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
These days, my life, I feel it has no purpose
But late at night, the feelings swim to the surface
'Cause on the surface, the city lights shine
They're calling at me, "Come and find your kind"
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
[Chorus]
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights!
[Verse 2]
We rode our bikes to the nearest park
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
You shield my eyes from the police lights
We run away, but we don't know why
Black River, your city lights shine
They're screaming at us, "We don't need your kind"
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
[Chorus]
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights!
[Verse 3]
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, I wonder if the world's so small
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?
[Chorus]
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights
I need the darkness; someone, please cut the lights
