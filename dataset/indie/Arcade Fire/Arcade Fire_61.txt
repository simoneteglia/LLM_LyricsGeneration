[Verse 1]
Said your name in an empty room
Said your name in an empty room
Something I would never do
Said your name in an empty room
Said your name in an empty room
Something I would never do
[Pre-Chorus]
I’m alone again
[Chorus]
When I’m by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don’t know when
[Verse 2]
You were burning, now you’re black and gray
You were burning, now you’re black and gray
Something I would never say
[Pre-Chorus]
I’m alone again
[Chorus]
When I’m by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don’t know when
[Outro]
Toute ma vie est avec toi
Toute ma vie est avec toi
Moi j’attends, toi tu pars
Toute ma vie est avec toi
Toute ma vie est avec toi
Moi j’attends, toi tu pars
