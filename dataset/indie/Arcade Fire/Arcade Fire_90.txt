[Verse 1]
I'll admit I'm full of shit
That's how I know I love you
That's how I know I trust you
You're not sure if there's a right or wrong
But it feels like there is when I treat you like this
[Refrain]
I go outside
I go outside
[Verse 2]
Texas, I won't come home
Not even if you call
I can't hear you at all
I can't explain why it's a sin
The state I'm living in
I just feel so tired
[Refrain]
I go outside
I go outside
[Interlude]
My mouth is full, your heart is an apple
Your mouth is full, my heart is an apple
Pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme
Pomme-pomme-pomme-pomme
[Outro]
Please don't even call
I can't hear you at all
