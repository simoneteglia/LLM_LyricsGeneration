[Verse 1]
On the 12th of January
You don't need what you can't carry
The blood will flow into the ocean
Their voices break with the emotion
[Refrain]
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified, then crucified again
[Verse 2]
In the night, they started singing
They had no right to keep believing
But down below, there's someone screaming
A broken church, no bells are ringing
[Refrain]
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
[Verse 3]
Preachers talk on television
Hand out the judgements of their religion
But when I heard those women singing
They made a sound I could believe in
[Refrain]
Crucified, then crucified again
[Verse 4]
He who strikes the blow forgets it
But he who bears the scar remembers
The fire is burning down to embers
The fire is burning but I can't remember
[Refrain]
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again
[Verse 5]
All you great and mighty nations
Who think you've paid for your high stations
Their cities may be built in the sand
But ours were built by their fathers hands
[Refrain]
They crucify, then crucified again
They crucify, then crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again
[Outro]
‘Til the crowd cry, "do it again!"
Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again
‘Til the crowd cry, "do it again!"
Crucified again
Crucified again
