[Verse 1]
They say it fades if you let it
Love was made to forget it
I carved your name across my eyelids
You pray for rain, I pray for blindness
[Chorus 1]
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love has fallen from me
If you still want me, please forgive me
Because the spark is not within me
[Post-Chorus]
I snuffed it out before my mom walked
In my bedroom
[Verse 2]
The only thing that you keep changing
Is your name, my love keeps growing
Still the same, just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer
[Chorus 2]
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love has fallen from me
If you still want me, please forgive me
Because your hands are not upon me
[Post-Chorus]
I shrugged them off before my mom walked
In my bedroom
[Verse 3]
The pains of love, and they keep growing
In my heart there's flowers growing
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer
[Chorus 3]
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me
If you still want me, please forgive me
[Bridge]
'Cause the spark is not within me
It's not within me
It's not within me
You gotta be the one
You gotta be the way
Your name is the only word that I can say
You gotta be the one
You gotta be the way
Your name is the only word
The only word that I can say
[Outro]
Only word that I can say
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
