[Intro]
This is Generation A and we're not gonna wait! Argh!
[Verse 1]
They say wait a little longer
And the times are gonna change
They say wait until tomorrow
Yesterday is always strange (Wait)
They say wait until you're older (Wait)
And you will understand (Wait)
They say the generation's coming
But I don't think they understand that I am not a patient man
[Chorus]
Hey (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
Too little, too late (late, late, late, late)
Too little, too late
Ah, haha
[Verse 2]
(Wait)
They say wait until you're ready (Wait)
Wait until your number's called (Wait)
They say "Wait, all we need is love"
But darling, California's burning
New Orleans is waiting for the flood
[Chorus]
Hey (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait)
Too little, too late (late, late, late, late)
They think they can take us down
(Too little, too late, late, late, late, late)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait)
Too little, too late (late, late, late, late)
It's too little, too late
[Bridge]
This is ain't summer of love
This is the summer of (aaaah)
Sing
Racists running, cities burning
Children show you what they're learning
Whole world finally fade away
We're called Generation A
[Chorus]
Hey (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
I can't wait (woo) (wait, wait, wait, wait)
It's too little, too late (late, late, late, late)
They think they can take us
(Too little, too late, late, late, late, late, late)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)
I can't wait (wait, wait, wait, wait)
It's too little, too late (late, late, late, late)
I think you got it
It's too little, too late (late, late, late, late)
Too little, too late (late, late, late, late)
Too little, too late
