[Verse 1]
All those wasted hours we used to know
Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind, it takes you where it wants to go
First, they built the road, then they built the town
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
That’s why we’re still driving around and around
And all we see
Are kids in the buses, longing to be free
[Chorus]
Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live
[Verse 2]
Some cities make you lose your head
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
What was that line you said?
Wishing you were anywhere but here
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You watch the life you’re living disappear
And now I see
We’re still kids in the buses, longing to be free
[Chorus]
Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live
A life that we can live
