[Verse 1: Win Butler]
The king's taken back the throne
The useless seed is sown
When they say they're cutting off the phone
I tell 'em you're not home
No place to hide
You were fighting as a soldier on their side
You're still a soldier in your mind
Though nothing's on the line
You say it's money that we need
As if we were only mouths to feed
I know no matter what you say
There are some debts you'll never pay
[Chorus: Win Butler]
Working for the Church while your family dies
You take what they give you and you keep it inside
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
I can taste the fear
Lift me up and take me out of here
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna die
Just wanna hear you cry
Who's gonna throw the very first stone?
Oh, who's gonna reset the bone?
Walking with your head in a sling
Wanna hear the soldier sing:
[Chorus: Win Butler]
"Workin' for the Church while my family dies
Your little baby sister's gonna lose her mind
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home"
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"

I can taste your fear (
Taste your fear
)
It's gonna lift you up and take you out of here (
Take you out of here
)
And the bone shall never heal
;
I care not if you kneel
We can't find you now (
We can't find you now
)
But they're gonna get their money back somehow (
They're gonna get their money back somehow
)
And when you finally disappear
We'll just say you were never here
[Chorus: Win Butler, &
Régine Chassagne
]
Been workin' for the Church while your life falls apart
(
Your life, it falls apart
)
Been singin' hallelujah with the fear in your heart
(
The fear, it's in your heart
)
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"
