[Verse 1]
Now that San Francisco's gone
I guess I'll just pack it in
Wanna wash away my sins
In the presence of my friends
You and I, we head back East
To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light
We can see that something's gotta give
When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
And my parents sent for me
From out West, where I was born
[Bridge]
Some people say
We've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost
For what we've lost
[Verse 2]
Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life
Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child
Pray to God I won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild
Though we knew this day would come
Still, it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born
I now see through a dead man's eyes
[Outro]
One day, they will see it's long gone
One day, they will see it's long gone
One day, they will see it's long gone
One day, they will see it's long gone
