This ain't no way of life

She says "There's diamonds in your eyes"
High on her own supply
She says "The air we're breathin' is from an exhaust pipe
Just a prototype"

You'll need a divine guide (
Ain't no way of life
)
'Cause this inferno's hyperdrive (
Don't believe thе hype
)
And the dreams in your hеad
The algorithm prescribed
Do you feel alright?
[Verse 3: Win Butler,

Your heroes are selling you underwear
And little white pills for your despair
Little black space between the stars
Dream of crashing expensive cars
One Christ child and one on the way
Why don't we name her
Sagittarius A*
What a pretty name

And anyway
The clothes don't fit me right (
Ain't no way of life

Must be the wrong body type (
Don't believe the hype

And the space where they say
Heaven is has gone away
Sagittarius A*
We'll see one day
What's on the other side
