[Verse 1]
All those wasted hours we used to know
Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind it takes you where it wants to go
First they built the road, then they built the town
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-ah)
That’s why we’re still driving around and around
And all we see are kids in buses longing to be free
[Chorus]
Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into a life that we can live
[Verse 2]
Some cities make you lose your head
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-ah)
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
What was that line you said?
(Something about how time runs down)
Wishing you were anywhere but here
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-ah)
You watch the life you’re living disappear
And now I see, we’re still kids in buses longing to be free
[Chorus]
Wasted hours before we knew
Where to go and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into a life that we can live
[Outro]
A life that we can live
A life that we can live
Don’t hold me down, don’t hold me down
Don’t hold me down, don’t hold me
A life that we can live
A life that we can live
Don’t hold me down, don’t hold me down
Don’t hold me down, don’t hold me
Don’t hold me down, don’t hold me down
Don’t hold me down, don’t hold me down
Don’t hold me
