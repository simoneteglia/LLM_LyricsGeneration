[Verse 1]
A vial of hope and a vial of pain
,
In the light, they both looked the same
Poured them out on into the world
,
On every boy and every girl
[Hook]
It's in the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
,
If the Neon Bible is right
[Verse 2]
Take the poison of your age
,
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
What I know is what you know is right
,
In the city it's the only light
[Hook]
It's in the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
,
If the Neon Bible is right
[Bridge]
Oh God! Well look at you now!
Oh! You lost it, but you don't know how!
In the light of a golden calf
,
Oh God! I had to laugh!
[Verse 3]
Take the poison of your age
,
Don't lick your fingers when you turn the page
It was wrong but you said it was right
,
In the future I will read at night
[Hook]
It's in the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible
Not much chance for survival
,
If the Neon Bible is true
