[Verse 1]
Hypocrite reader, my double, my brother
Your daddy really took it out of you
But did he speak it in tongues?
But did he speak it in tongues?
[Refrain]
Sneaking out the windows now
You've got the spirit now
[Verse 2]
Hypocrite reader, my double, my brother
Where did we lose our way?
It's like we're speaking in tongues
It's like we're speaking in tongues
[Refrain]
Sneaking out the windows now
You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now
[Verse 3]
Hypocrite reader, my double, my brother
Now I can't understand a word
Now you're speaking in tongues
Now you're speaking in tongues
Now you're speaking in tongues (Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues (Speaking in tongues)
[Outro]
Come out of your head
And into my world now
Come out of your head
And into my world, my world, my world now
(Speaking in tongues)
