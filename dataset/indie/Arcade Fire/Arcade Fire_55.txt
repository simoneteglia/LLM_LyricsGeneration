[Verse 1: Win Butler]
I heard the thunder on the blue sky perfect day
I wonder why, am I the only one?
I heard the thunder and I feel I'm going under
Jesus Christ was an only son
[Pre-Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
I heard the thunder and I thought it was the answer
But I find I got the question wrong
I was trying to run away, but a voice told me to stay
And put the feeling in a song
[Pre-Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?
