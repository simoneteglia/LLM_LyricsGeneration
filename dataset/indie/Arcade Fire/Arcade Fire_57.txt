Black Wave
[Verse 1: Régine Chassagne]
We can reach the sea
They won't follow me
Shadows, they fear the sun
We'll make it if we run!
[Chorus: Régine Chassagne]
Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent
[Verse 2: Régine Chassagne]
Left my name with the border guards
A name that I don't need
Ce sera un long voyage
Sur les vagues de l'oubli
[Chorus: Régine Chassagne]
Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent
Bad Vibrations
[Verse 1: Win Butler]
Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me
Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me
For you
For me
It's always for you
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me
Stop now before it's too late
Your lover was for hire, have you noticed he's been late?
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me
And for you
For me
It's always for you
[Outro: Win Butler]
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
