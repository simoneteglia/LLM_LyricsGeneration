Brazil
Where hearts were entertained in June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly whispered "one day soon"
We kissed and clung together then
Tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
And now
As twilight moves the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
There's one thing that I'm certain of
Return, I will, to old Brazil
