[Verse 1: Win Butler, &
Win Butler with Régine Chassagne
]
It's the age of doubt
And I doubt we’ll figure it out
Is it you or is it me?
The age of anxiety
(Are you talking to me?)
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
Fight the fever with TV
In the age where nobody sleeps
And the pills do nothing for me
In
the age of anxiety
[Pre-Chorus: Win Butler, &
Win Butler with Régine Chassagne
]
When I look at you,
I see what you want me to
See what you want me to
When you look at me,
you see what I want you to see
What I want you to see
[Chorus: Win Butler]
In the age of, living in the age of, living in the age of
In the age of, living in the age of, living in the age of
[Verse 3: Win Butler,
Régine Chassagne
, &
Both
]
It's a maze (
It's a maze
) of mirrors (
Of mirrors
)
It’s a hologram of a ghost
And you can't quite touch it
Which is how it hurts us the most
So we keep it all inside
(Inside, inside)
And hide it deep in a drawer
Say your prayers tonight
Someone finds it after the war
[Pre-Chorus: Win Butler, &
Win Butler with Régine Chassagne
]
And when I look at you,
I see what you want me to
See what you want me to
When you look at me,
you see what I want you to see
See what I want you to see is me
[Chorus: Win Butler, &
Win Butler with Régine Chassagne
]
In the age of, living in the age of, living in the age of
In the age of, living in the age of, living in
the
age of
anxiety
[Refrain: Régine Chassagne &
Win Butler
]
Gotta get the spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me
Gotta get the spirit out of me
This anxiety that's inside of me
Gotta get the spirit out of me
(Gotta get the spirit out of me)
This anxiety that's inside of me, baby
(This anxiety that's inside of me)
Gotta get the spirit out of me (Gotta get the spirit out of me)
This anxiety that's inside of me, baby
(This anxiety that's inside of me)
[Bridge: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
’Cause I can’t stop crying and I really think I mean it
But the tears mean nothing to me
Another lost alien arriving on my spaceship
In the age of anxiety (
Anxiety
)
And we can't stop crying and we really think we mean it
But the tears just fall on the sheet
(
Anxiety
)
Another lost soul just trying to feel something
Trying to feel something, trying to feel something in the age of (
Anxiety
)
[Refrain: Win Butler &
Reginé Chassagne
]
Gotta get the spirit out of me
This anxiety that’s inside of me
For me
(
Gotta get the spirit out of me
)
Are you talking to me or about me?
(
This anxiety that's inside of me
)
(
Gotta get the spirit out of me
)
Am I talking to you or about you?
(
This anxiety that's inside of me
)
[Outro: Win Butler]
It's all about you
It’s not about you
It's all about you
It's not about you
It's all about you
It's not about you
