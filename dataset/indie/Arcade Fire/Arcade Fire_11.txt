[Verse 1]
The businessmen are drinking my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
And I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "Can we still be friends?"
[Chorus 1]
If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
[Verse 2]
All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But they bow down to him anyway
Because it's better than being alone
[Chorus 1]
If I was scared, I would
And if I was bored, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
[Verse 3]
Now you're knocking at my door
Saying, "Please come out with us tonight"
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen are drinking my blood
Like the kids at art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "Can we still be friends?"
[Chorus 2]
If I was scared, I would
And if I was pure, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
Now I'm ready to start
If I was scared, I would
And if I was pure, you know I would
And if I was yours, but I'm not
Now I'm ready to start
[Outro]
Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
And now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Not sure you'll open the door
To step out into the dark
Now I'm ready
