THE LIGHTNING I
[Verse 1]
Fourth place anthem playing tonight, on a broken radio
I thought we reached the mountaintop, but now, we just feel so low
The sky is breaking open, we keep hoping, in the distance we'll see a glow
Lightning, light our way ’til the black sky turns back to indigo
[Chorus]
We can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don’t quit on me
We can make it, baby
Please don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
I never quit on you
[Verse 2]
We were born in paradise, beneath a poisoned sky
Under a bad sign, the micro-age of Gemini
And we are still unlearning, tires are burning in the middle of Rodeo Drive
You know that we've been beat down and broken, but now we can testify
[Chorus]
We can make it if you don't quit on me
I won't quit on you
Don't quit on me
We can make it, baby
Please don’t quit on me
I won’t quit on you
Don't quit on me
I’ll never quit on you
[Outro: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
It's not up to you
Some you win, some you lose (
When the lightning comes
)
You don't get to choose
Some you win, some you lose (
When the lightning comes
)
One, two, three, four
THE LIGHTNING II
[Verse 1: Win Butler]
I heard the thunder on the blue sky perfect day
I wonder why, am I the only one?
I heard the thunder and I feel I'm going under
Jesus Christ was an only son
[Pre-Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
I heard the thunder and I thought it was the answer
But I find I got the question wrong
I was trying to run away, but a voice told me to stay
And put the feeling in a song
[Pre-Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?
