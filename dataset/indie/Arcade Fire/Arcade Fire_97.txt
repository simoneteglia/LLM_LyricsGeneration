Nights are long since you went away
I dream about you all through the day
My buddy
My buddy
Nobody quite so true - wait, that's a wrong note and that's a wrong note and tune that flat g-string; that's better, that's better, that's better
Miss your voice and the touch of your hand
I long to know that you understand
My buddy
My buddy
Your buddy misses you
