[Verse 1]
Now the future's staring at me
Like a vision from the past
And I know these crumbs they sold me
They're never going to last
Though we know the culture war
We don't know what it's for but
We've lived the southern strategy
You know it's never going to last
So keep it in the past
[Chorus]
These are different times that we're living in
These are different times
Now the kids are growing up so fast
Paying for our crimes
[Verse 2]
You left while I was sleeping
You said, "It's down to me"
Oh I've read a little Bible
You see what you want to see
Oh, we know the culture war
We don't know what it's for but
We've lived your southern strategy
You know it's never going to last
So keep that shit in the past
[Chorus]
These are different times that we're living in
Cause these are different times
Now the kids are growing up so fast
They're paying for our crimes
[Verse 3]
The dominos they never fell
But bodies they still burn
Throw my hand into the fire
But still I never learn
Will I ever learn?
[Chorus]
That these are different times
Now the kids are growing up so fast
And paying for our crimes
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy
In your culture war
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy
But we don't know what it's for
[Verse 4]
We're soldiers now in the culture war
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for
We're soldiers now in the culture war
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for
So tell me what's it for
[Outro]
You want it? You got it, here's your culture war
You want it? Now you've got it, so tell me what's it for
