[Verse 1: Régine Chassagne]
At the crossroad
There's a street sign
It’s a construct
How'd it get in my mind?
It's a door to the divine
It’s a fine line in the end times
[Pre-Chorus: Régine Chassagne]
I'll be yours
You can be mine
Love unites
Breaking as the light divides into the color of your eyes
[Chorus: Régine Chassagne & Win Butler]
I'll be your race and religion
You be my race and religion
This love is no superstition
United body and soul (Hey)
[Post-Chorus: Régine Chassagne &
Peter Gabriel
]
Race and religion
Race and religion (
Race and religion
)
[Verse 2: Régine Chassagne &
Régine Chassagne with Win Butler
]
It's joy and it's union
Your sense of rhythm
How you take communion
It's a door to the divine
It's the moonlight on a landmine
[Pre-Chorus: Régine Chassagne &
Peter Gabriel
]
I'll be yours (
I’ll be yours
)
You can be mine (
You can be mine
)
Love unites
Breaking as the light divides into the color of your eyes
[Chorus: Régine Chassagne & Win Butler]
I’ll be your race and religion
You be my race and religion
This love is no competition
United body and soul
[Post-Chorus: Régine Chassagne &
Peter Gabriel
]
Race and religion
Race and religion (
Race and religion
)
[Bridge: Régine Chassagne, Win Butler & Peter Gabriel]
The light arrives from the past
Hits your eyes before it divides into colors
You and me could be we
Could be we
Are the light you can't see and we
Are the roots of the tree
And we’ve got one life
No time for division
New vision
Be my race and religion
[Post-Chorus: Régine Chassagne &
Peter Gabriel
]
Race and religion (
Race and religion
)
Race and religion
Race and religion (
Race and religion
)
[Outro: Peter Gabriel, Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
Hey
I'll be your
race and religion
You could be my
body and soul
(Body and soul)
I'll be your
race and religion
You could be my
body and soul
(Body and soul)
I'll be your
race and religion
You could be my
body and soul
