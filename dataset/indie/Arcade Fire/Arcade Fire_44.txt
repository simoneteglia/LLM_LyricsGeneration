[Verse 1]
Every night my dream’s the same
Same old city with a different name
Men are coming to take me away
I don’t know why, but I know I can’t stay
[Verse 2]
There’s a weight that’s pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can’t swim across a river so deep
[Chorus]
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don’t know where
And they don’t know when it’s coming, when it’s coming
[Verse 3]
There’s this fear I keep so deep
Knew its name since before I could speak, yeah, oh
[Chorus]
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don’t know where
And they don’t know when it’s coming
Oh! when, but it’s coming
Keep the car running
[Verse 4]
If some night I don’t come home
Please don’t think I’ve left you alone
The same place animals go when they die
You can’t climb across a mountain so high
The same city where I go when I sleep
You can’t swim across a river so deep
[Chorus]
They know my name cause I told it to them
But they don’t know where
And they don’t know when it’s coming
Oh! when is it coming?
Keep the car running
Keep the car running
Keep the car running
