[Verse 1]
Every inch of sky's got a star
And every inch of skin's got a scar
I guess that you've got everything now
And every inch of space in your head
Is filled up with the things that you read
I guess that you've got everything now
And every film that you've ever seen
Fills the spaces up in your dreams
That reminds me
Everything now!
Everything now!
[Verse 2]
Every inch of road's got a sign
And every boy uses the same line
I pledge allegiance to everything now
And every song that I've ever heard
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
We turn the speakers up 'til they break
'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake
[Pre-Chorus]
Stop pretending, you've got
everything now!
[Chorus]
I need it (
Everything now!
)
I want it (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
(
Everything now!
)
Everything now
[Verse 3]
Every inch of road's got a town
Daddy, how come you're never around?
I miss you, like everything now
Mama, leave the food on the stove
Leave your car in the middle of the road
This happy family with everything now
We turn the speakers up 'til they break
'Cause every time you smile, it's a fake
[Pre-Chorus]
Stop pretending, you've got
everything now!
[Chorus]
I need it (
Everything now!
)
I want it (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
(
Everything now!
)
'Til every room in my house (
Everything now!
)
Is filled with shit I couldn't live without (
Everything now!
)
(
Everything now!
)
I need it (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
(
Everything now!
)
Everything now
[Bridge]
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la
La, la, la, la, la-la
[Pre-Chorus]
Stop pretending, you've got
everything now!
[Chorus]
I need it (
Everything now!
)
I want it (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
I can't live (
Everything now!
)
And every room in my house (
Everything now!
)
Is filled with shit I couldn't live without
(
Everything now!
)
I need it (
Everything now!
)
I can't live without (
Everything now!
)
I can't live (
Everything now!
)
[Outro]
Every inch of space in my heart (
Everything now!
)
(
Everything now!
)
Is filled with something I'll never start
The ashes of everything now
And then you're black again
Can't make it back again
From everything now
