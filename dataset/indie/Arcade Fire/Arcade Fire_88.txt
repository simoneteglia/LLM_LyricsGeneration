[Verse 1: Win Butler]
Soft power got them so upset
They think it's over, but it's not done yet
Soft power in the underground
Gonna let the wind, blow the shit all around
[Chorus: Win Butler]
Well, soft power gets into our brains
Soft power, now it's never gonna to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power, it's alright
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
All your power makes the world go round
You can cut the speakers, you can cut all the sound
But can you hear us, singing our song
Soft power, now it's coming on strong
[Chorus]
Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power, now it's never gonna to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power, it's alright
[Post-Chorus]
Soft power, look at them go
Soft power, about to explode
Soft power, in the
Underworld
Soft power, every boy and girl
[Verse: 3]
We were born, so it's our right
You can cut all the power, you can cut all the lights
But we can see you even in the dark
Your words are fire, and we are the spark
[Chorus]
Well, soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never gonna to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power, it's alright
[Post-Chorus]
Soft power, look at them go
Soft power, about to explode
Soft power, in the Underworld
Soft power, every boy and girl
[Bridge]
Call a doctor, when it's not alright
Call a doctor, ‘cause it's not alright
Call a doctor, it's not alright
Call a doctor, ‘cause it's not alright
Well
[Outro]
We'd love to help you
But we're not home
Leave a message, it's impossible now
We'd love to help you
But we're not home
Leave a message, it's impossible now
We'd love to help you
But we're not home
Leave a message, it's impossible now
[Studio Out-Take]
One, two, three
Here we go
Right here go
Okay here we go, here we go
One two three
