[Intro]
Put your money on me
'Cause I can barely breathe
Put your money on me
[Chorus]
Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go
[Verse 1]
If there was a race, a race for your heart
It started before you were born
Above the chloroform sky
Clouds made of
ambien
Sitting on carpets in the
basement of Heaven
We were born innocent, but it lasts a day
And baby you can give all the money away
But if there's a race, a race for your heart
It's over before it starts
Singing
[Chorus]
Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go
[Verse 2]
All my presents are broken before they're open
And the promises, the second they're spoken
I know I've been different
My skin keeps shedding
My mother was crying on the day of our wedding
Trumpets of angels call for my head
I fight through the ether and I'll quit when I'm dead
If you want to know who'll be there in the end
When you bury me, baby, I'll still be your friend
Singing
[Chorus]
Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go
[Post-Chorus]
Singing put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on
Put your money on
I know it's not easy
[Bridge]
To put your money on me
'Cause I can barely breathe
When you put your money on me
When Silicon Valley's melted back into silicon
We'll find a way to survive
Singing
[Chorus]
Put your money on me
If you think I'm losing you, you must be crazy
All your money on me
I'm never gonna let you go, even when it's easy
Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go
[Post-Chorus]
Singing put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on
Put your money on
I know it's not easy
To put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not the last time
Put your money on
All your money on me
Put your money on
I know it's not easy
[Outro]
To put your money on me
All your money on me
