[Verse 1]
We're playing those mind games together
Pushing the barrier, planting seeds
Playing the mind guerilla
Chanting the mantra, "peace on Earth"
We all playing those mind games forever
Some kind of Druid dude, lifting the veil
Doing the mind guerilla
Some call it magic, the search for the grail
[Chorus 1]
Love is the answer
And you know that, for sure
Love is the flower
You gotta let it, gotta let it grow
[Verse 2]
So keep on playing those mind games together
Faith in the future, out of the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerillas
Absolute elsewhere, in the stones of your mind
[Bridge]
Yeah, we're playing those mind games forever
Projecting our images in space and in time
[Chorus 2]
Yes is the answer
And you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You gotta let it, you gotta let it go
[Verse 3]
So keep on playing those mind games together
Doing the ritual, dance in the sun
Millions of mind guerillas
Putting their soul power to the karmic wheel
[Bridge]
Keep on playing those mind games forever
Raising the spirit of peace and love
Love
[Outro]
I want you to make love, not war
I know you heard it, you heard it before
I want you to make love, not war
I know you heard it all, you heard it before
