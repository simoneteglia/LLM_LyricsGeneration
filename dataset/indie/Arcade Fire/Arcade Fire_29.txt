[Verse 1]
I know you're living in my mind
It's not the same as being alive
I know you're living in my mind
It's not the same as being alive

[Verse 2]
If telling the truth is not polite
Then I guess you'll have to fight
If telling the truth is not polite
Then I guess we'll have to fight
[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I lived for a year, in the bed by the window
Reading books, better than memories
Wanna feel the seasons passing
Wanna feel the spring
[Refrain]
Of supersymmetry
Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry
[Verse 4]
It's been a while since I've been to see you
I don't know where, but you're not with me
Heard a voice, like an echo
But it came from me
[Refrain]
Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry (Supersymmetry)
Supersymmetry (Supersymmetry)
Supersymmetry (Supersymmetry)
[Bridge]
Ah, lalala lala
Ah, lalala la
Ah, lalala lala
Ah, lalala la
[Refrain]
Supersymmetry
