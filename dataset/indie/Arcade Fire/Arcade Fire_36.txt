[Verse 1: Win Butler,
with Régine Chassagne
]
Those cool kids stuck in the past
Apartments of cigarette ash
Wait outside until it begins
Won't be the first ones in
Spend your life waiting in line
You find it
hard to define
But you do it
every time
Then you do it again
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
[Verse 2: Win Butler,
with Régine Chassagne
]
First kiss tastes like cigarettes
Dead man walking take your bets
Once again you lost your friends
Around and around again
Those cool kids
stuck in the past
Apartments of
cigarette ash
"Where are we going?",
Who did you ask?
Those cool kids
stuck in the past
In a world of
cigarette ash
"Where are we going?",
Who did you ask?
Who did you ask?
[Chorus: Win Butler,
Régine Chassagne
, &
Both
]
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
, say
Looking for signs of life
(Looking for signs of life)
Looking for signs
every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
[Verse 3: Win Butler,
with Régine Chassagne
]
Monday
, Tuesday,
Wednesday
, Thursday
Friday
, Saturday, sometimes Sunday
Love is hard, sex is easy
God in Heaven, could you please me?
You think you invented life
You find it
hard to define
But you do it
every time
Then you do it again
[Chorus: Win Butler,
Régine Chassagne
, &
Both
]
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Still
looking for signs of life
(Looking for signs of life)
Looking for signs
every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
[Verse 4: Win Butler]
Those cool kids stuck in the past
In a world of cigarette ash
"Where are we going?", Who did you ask?
Who did you ask?
[Chorus: Win Butler,
with Régine Chassagne
]
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
[Bridge: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
(Still looking)
Looking for signs of life
Signs of life
Still looking for signs of life
Signs of life
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
[Outro: Win Butler]
Can we do it?
