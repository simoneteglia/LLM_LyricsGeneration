[Verse 1: Win Butler]
When Lenin was little
All the birds in the forest were singing "man this is it"
Now that he's older
All the sailors in heaven are singing 'Abandon ship'
[Chorus: Régine Chassagne]
I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I said
In my head
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
When Lenin was little
Dressed up like a vampire on All Hallow’s Eve
All the saints up in heaven
Looking down at the leaves falling off the tree
[Chorus: Régine Chassagne]
I know it can't be right
I know it can't be right
But I just smile instead
Of repeating what I said
[Bridge: Régine Chassagne]
Daddy daddy, please spare the world
From the government
Daddy daddy, please spare my soul
From my own judgment
Daddy daddy, please send me a heart
That isn't made of cement
Cause the money's all been spent
[Interlude]
[Bridge: Régine Chassagne]
Daddy daddy, please spare the world
From the government
Daddy daddy, please spare my soul
From my judgment
Daddy daddy, please send me a heart
That is made of cement
Cause the money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
The money's all been spent
