[Verse 1]
Something filled up
My heart with nothing
Someone told me not to cry
But now that I'm older
My heart's colder
And I can see that it's a lie
[Verse 2]
Children, wake up
Hold your mistake up
Before they turn the summer into dust
If the children don't grow up
Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up
We're just a million little gods causing rain storms
Turning every good thing to rust
I guess we'll just have to adjust
[Bridge]
With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going to be
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand
[Outro]
With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am going
With my lightning bolts a-glowing
I can see where I am go-going
You better look out below!
