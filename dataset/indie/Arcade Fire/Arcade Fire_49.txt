[Verse 1]
Let’s go downtown and watch the modern kids
Let’s go downtown and talk to the modern kids
They will eat right out of your hand
Using great big words that they don’t understand
[Chorus]
They’re singing
Rococo, Rococo, Rococo, Rococo
Rococo, Rococo, Rococo, Rococo
[Verse 2]
They build it up just to burn it back down
They build it up just to burn it back down
The wind is blowing all the ashes around
Oh my dear God, what is that horrible song?
[Chorus]
They’re singing
Rococo, Rococo, Rococo, Rococo
Rococo, Rococo, Rococo, Rococo
Rococo, Rococo
Rococo
[Verse 3]
They seem wild but they are so tame
They seem wild but they are so tame
They’re moving towards you with their colors all the same
They want to own you but they don’t know what game
They’re playing
[Chorus]
They’re singing
Rococo, Rococo, Rococo, Rococo
Rococo, Rococo
Rococo
Rococo
Rococo
Rococo
Rococo
Rococo
Rococo
