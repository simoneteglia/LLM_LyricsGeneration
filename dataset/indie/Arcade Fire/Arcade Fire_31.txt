[Intro]
Hey!
Hey!
[Verse 1]
We know a place where no planes go
We know a place where no ships go
[Chorus]
Hey!
No cars go!
Hey!
No cars go!
Where we know
[Verse 2]
We know a place no spaceships go
We know a place where no subs go
[Chorus]
Hey!
No cars go!
Hey!
No cars go!
Where we know
Woo!
[Interlude]
Go!
No go!
[Chorus]
Hey!
Us kids know
Hey!
No cars go!
Where we know
Woo!
[Bridge]
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
[Outro]
Little babies, let's go!
Women and children, let's go!
Old folks, let's go!
Don't know where we're going
