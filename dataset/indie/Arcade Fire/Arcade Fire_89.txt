[Intro]
I guess we'll have to move
The neighborhood is on to us
Let's join the little babes
Throwing rocks in front of us
[Verse 1]
Riding on my bicycle
I pass my sister on a bus
Let's take the country road
Before our parents send for us
[Verse 2]
Trees keep falling at my feet
I guess it's time to build a boat
Make a raft of our bodies
Do you think that it'll float
[Verse 3]
What I said was not a joke
But you just licked the envelope
I'm tired of dating, let's elope
But you just licked the envelope
[Verse 4]
Three cheers for my parents
Lonely failed experiments!
Three cheers for my parents
Lonely failed experiments!
