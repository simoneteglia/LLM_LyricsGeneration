[Verse 1]
So I wait my turn, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like
So I wait in line, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Something don't feel right
[Verse 2]
Like a record that's skipping, I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps ticking, I'm a modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like
[Chorus]
In my dream, I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said, "You're going nowhere"
They say we are the chosen few, but we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
[Verse 3]
On a number from the modern man
Maybe when you're older you will understand
Why you don't feel right
Why you can't sleep at night now
[Bridge]
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
[Verse 4]
Oh, I had a dream I was dreaming
And I feel I'm losing the feeling
Makes me feel like
Like something don't feel right
I erase the number of the modern man
Wanna break the mirror of the modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like
[Chorus]
In my dream, I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said, "You're going nowhere"
I know we are the chosen few, but we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
[Bridge]
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
If it's alright
Then how come you can't sleep at night?
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
[Outro]
I'm the modern man
I'm the modern man
I'm the modern man
I'm a modern man
