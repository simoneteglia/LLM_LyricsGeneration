[Chorus]
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
[Verse 1]
I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again
[Chorus]
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
[Verse 2]
You hurt yourself again
Along with all your friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again
[Bridge]
Here comes the night time
Coming on slow (
Here comes the night time
)
Here comes the night time
I know that you know
(
Here comes the night time
)
[Chorus]
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
(
Here comes the night
)
[Verse 3]
Well
I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again
[Chorus]
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night
