[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, you head inside
'Cause the lights don't work
Yeah, nothing works, they say you don't mind
[Chorus]
But here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
[Verse 2]
And the missionaries
They tell us we will be left behind
Been left behind
A thousand times, a thousand times
If you want to be righteous
If you want to be righteous, get in line
'Cause here comes the night time
[Chorus]
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
Here comes the night
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
[Verse 3]
They say heaven's a place
Yeah, heaven's a place and they know where it is
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
And when they hear the beat
Coming from the street, they lock the door
But if there's no music
Up in heaven, then what's it for?
When I hear the beat
The spirit's on me like a live-wire
A thousand horses
Running wild in a city on fire
But it starts in your feet
Then it goes to your head
And if you can't feel it
Then the rules are dead
And if you're the judge
Then what is our crime?
Here comes the night time
[Chorus]
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Look out, here comes the night
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Here comes the night, the night, the night, the night time!
[Bridge]
Now the preachers they talk
Up on the satellite
If you're looking for hell
Just try looking inside
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
[Outro]
When you look in the sky
Just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
When you look in the sky
Just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
Here comes the night time
