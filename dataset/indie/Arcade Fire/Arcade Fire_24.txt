[Verse 1]
I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside
And I can fall asleep
[Verse 2]
My family tree's
Losing all its leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat
To melt the street beneath your feet
[Chorus]
Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning
[Verse 3]
I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside...
[Chorus]
Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning. O-oh..!
[Outro]
Hoo-oo-ooh! Hoo-oo-ooh!
No-or-aaah!
Hoo-oo-ooh! Hoo-oo-ooh...!
