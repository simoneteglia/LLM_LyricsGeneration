[Verse 1: Win Butler]
Alexander, our older brother
Set out for a great adventure
He tore our images out of his pictures
He scratched our names out of all his letters
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Our mother should have
Just named you Laika
[Verse 2: Win Butler]
Come on Alex, you can do it
Come on Alex, there's nothing to it
If you want something, don't ask for nothing
If you want nothing, don't ask for something
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne,
Win Butler
]
Our mother should have
Just named you Laika
It's for your own good
It's for the neighborhood
The neighborhood
[Verse 3: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Our older brother bit by a vampire
For a year we caught his tears in a cup
And now we're gonna make him drink it
Come on Alex, don't die or dry up
[Chorus: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne,
Win Butler
]
Our mother should have
Just named you Laika
It's for your own good
It's for the neighborhood
The neighborhood
[Bridge: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
When daddy comes home you always start a fight
So the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights
The police disco lights
[Outro: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
Now the neighbors can dance (
The police
)
Now the neighbors can dance (
Disco lights
)
Now the neighbors can dance (
The police
)
Now the neighbors can dance (
Disco lights
)
Look at them dance
