[Verse 1: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
Hey, Orpheus!
I'm behind you
Don't turn around
I can find you
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I call for you
Oh, Orpheus!
Just sing for me all night
We'll wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
You say it's not me, it's you
[Verse 2: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne,
Régine Chassagne
]
Hey, Orpheus!
De l'autre côté de l'eau
Comme un écho
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I shout for you
Never doubt
Don't turn around too soon
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
[Chorus: Win Butler, &
Win Butler with Régine Chassagne
]
It seems so important now
But you will get over
It seems so important now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will remember
Why it was so important then
It seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will discover
That it's never over
[Verse 3: Win Butler &
Régine Chassagne
]
Hey, Eurydice! (
'Cause only love
)
Can you see me?
(
Can end this way
)
I will sing your name
'Til you're sick of me
(
The afterlife behind the gates
)
Just wait until it's over (
Tu dis que c’est la fin du monde
)
Just wait until it's through (
c’est ton silence mon eau profonde
)
When if you call for me (
We stood beside
)
This frozen sea (
A frozen sea
)
It melts beneath me
(
I saw you out in front of me
)
Just wait until it's over (
Reflected light, a hollow moon
)
Wait until it's through (
Oh, Orpheus, don't turn around too soon
)
[Chorus: Win Butler, &
Win Butler with Régine Chassagne
]
It seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
It seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will remember
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
And now that it's over
And now that you're older
Then you will discover
[Bridge: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne]
That it's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
Sometime (
Sometime
)
Sometime (
Sometime
)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (
Eat you alive
)
But it's never gonna happen now (
Never gonna happen now
)
We'll figure it out somehow (
Out somehow
)
Sometime (
Sometime
)
Sometime (
Sometime
)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (
Eat you alive
)
But it's never gonna happen now (
Never gonna happen now
)
We'll figure it out somehow (
Out somehow
)
'Cause it's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
It's never over (
It's never over
)
[Outro: Win Butler & Régine Chassagne,
Win Butler
, &
Régine Chassagne
]
We stood beside
A frozen sea
I saw you out
In front of me
Reflected light
A hollow moon
Oh, Orpheus
(
Eurydice
)
It's over too soon
