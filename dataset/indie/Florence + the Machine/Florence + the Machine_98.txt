[Verse 1]
When your life is over
I won't be sad or blue
I'll put on my fancy hat
Lie down next to you
[Chorus]
I'll kiss you once for life
I'll kiss you twice for death
Hold you close for comfort
Wearing my best dress
[Verse 2]
You look so angry when you sleep
Your face a troubled frown
So I will smooth your furrowed brow
As I lay you in the ground
[Chorus]
I'll kiss you once for life
I'll kiss you twice for death
Hold you close for comfort
Wearing my best dress
[Verse 3]
And as the mourners pass me
I will smile and wave
Thank them for their sympathy
And tell them I'll be brave
But once the wake is over
And I'm drunk and feeling fine
I'll go out there and find me
Another boy to pass the time
As we're dancing cheek to cheek
And the lights are laid low
I'll request this song for you
Laying in the ground below
Once the song is over
And it's time to go to bed
I'll leave him on the dance floor
And return to you instead
[Chorus]
I'll kiss you once for life
I'll kiss you twice for death
Hold you close for comfort
Wearing my best dress
