[Verse 1]
Well, did you miss me?
Walk on water just to kiss me?
Oh, come and get me
Drag me out, destroy me
I've been expecting you, I'm ready
Deliver me that bad news, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Am I your dream girl?
You think of me in bed
But you could never hold me
And like me better in your head
Make me evil
Then I'm an angel instead
At least you'll sanctify me when I'm dead
[Chorus]
Dream girl evil
Dream girl еvil
Dream girl evil
Dream girl еvil
[Verse 2]
Well, did I disappoint you?
Did mommy make you sad?
Do I just remind you
Of every girl that made you mad?
Make me perfect, make me your fantasy
You know I deserve it
Well, take it out on me
[Pre-Chorus]
Am I your dream girl?
You think of me in bed
But you could never hold me
You like me better in your head
Make me evil
Then I'm an angel instead
At least you'll sanctify me when I'm dead
[Chorus]
Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil
Dream girl evil
[Bridge]
Watch me shimmer (Shimmer)
A projection of your mother (Mother)
But don't come cryin' (Cry)
I am nobody's moral center (Center)
[Outro]
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)
It cannot hold (Dream girl)
It cannot hold (Evil)
