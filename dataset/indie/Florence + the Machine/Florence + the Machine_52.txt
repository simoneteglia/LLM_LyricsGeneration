[Verse 1]
I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced to crown
I was a heavy heart to carry
My feet dragged across the ground
And he took me to the river
Where he slowly let me drown
[Pre-Chorus]
My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall
[Chorus]
I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy in your arms
[Verse 2]
And is it worth the wait?
All this killing time?
Are you strong enough to stand
Protecting both your heart and mine?
Who is the betrayer?
Who's the killer in the crowd?
The one who creeps in corridors
And doesn't make a sound
[Pre-Chorus]
My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall
My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall
[Chorus]
I'm so heavy
Heavy, heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy, heavy,
heavy
, heavy
Heavy, so heavy in your arms
[Bridge]
This will be my last confession
"I love you" never felt like any blessing
Oh
Whispering like it's a secret
Uttered to condemn the one who hears it
With a heavy heart
Whoa
[Chorus]
(Heavy) Heavy, heavy
(Heavy) I'm so heavy in your arms
(I'm so heavy) Heavy, heavy
(Heavy) I'm so heavy in your arms
(I'm so heavy) Heavy, heavy
(Heavy) I'm so heavy in your arms
(I'm so heavy) Heavy, heavy
(Heavy) I'm so heavy in your arms
[Post-Chorus]
I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced to crown
I was a heavy heart to carry
But he never let me down
When he had me in his arms
My feet never touched the ground
[Outro]
I'm so heavy
Heavy in your arms
Heavy
I'm so heavy in your arms
