[Verse 1]
In the celestial vaults
I drew bedraggled breaths
Because I am unloved
I went as far as I could get
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time
[Verse 2]
Past the museum of death
And the mad man yelling answers
I sail on new beginnings
And psychics taking chances
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time
[Chorus]
As far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time
[Verse 3]
Past the spires and the temple
Looking like a Disney castle
As far as I could get
Past the girls late for rehearsal
Oh, a pirate on the left
And Jesus on the right
And the Pacific sweeps through
Like a bird in flight
[Chorus]
As far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And the cedars like spires
Wasting my goddamn time
[Bridge]
Cause if I am unloved, I have unloved too
Cause if I am unloved, I have unloved too
As far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
[Verse 4]
Past the city and the sermons
The cemetery standing still
Past the mountain and the monument
The houses and the hills
Past the signs and the sirens
The sinners and the saints
I went as far as I could get
Past the hallowed and the horror
The humbled and the greed
I went as far as I could get
Cause if I am unloved, I have unloved too
[Outro]
As far as I could get
As far as I could get
As far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
I went as far as I could get
And I'm not far enough yet
