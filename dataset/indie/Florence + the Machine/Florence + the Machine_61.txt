[Verse 1]
Blinded by the glare
I was moving like I didn't care
But it was more than I could bear
You know I hoped I'd see you there
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring out the window
I could see into the soul of every passer by
So many lives
So many pairs of eyes
A pure feeling
I'm invisible and magical
If only for a moment
A pure feeling
I'm scared to control it
[Chorus]
Stretching out my arms
I let it comfort me
Our bodies moving in the dark
It takes the pain from me
And then I am in love
With everyone I see
I keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be
[Verse 2]
And the illusion starts to tear
Let everybody stand and stare
Cause now I have no fear
I knew that this would end in tears
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring out the window
I could see into the soul of every passer by
So many lives
So many pairs of eyes
A pure feeling
I'm invisible and magical
If only for a moment
A pure feeling
I'm scared to control it
[Chorus]
Stretching out my arms
I let it comfort me
Our bodies moving in the dark
It takes the pain from me
And then I am in love
With everyone I see
I keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be
[Bridge]
Those strangers carry me
I'm lost; they're finding me
I'm gone; they're there with me
But it's not over
The spaces in between
They keep you far from me
The emptiness; it means it's not over
[Chorus]
Stretching out my arms
I let it comfort me
Our bodies moving in the dark
It takes the pain from me
And then I am in love
With everyone I see
I keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be
[Chorus]
Stretching out my arms
I let it comfort me
Our bodies moving in the dark
It takes the pain from me
And then I am in love
With everyone I see
I keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be
