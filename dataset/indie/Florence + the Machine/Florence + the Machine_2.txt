[Intro]
High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most
[Verse 1]
The ones who'd been gone for so very long
She couldn't remember their names
They spun her around on the damp old stone
Spun away all her sorrow and pain
[Chorus]
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
[Verse 2]
They danced through the day and into the night
Through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer and winter again
'Til the walls did crumble and fall
[Chorus]
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
[Outro]
High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most
