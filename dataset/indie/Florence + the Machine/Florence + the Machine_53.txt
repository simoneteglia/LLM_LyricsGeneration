[Intro]
I thought that I was hungry for love
Maybe I was just hungry for blood
Sea foam woman on the shore
Your prairie ghost, I'm a cottage whore
All the mermaids have sharp teeth
Razor blades all in your feet
[Verse 1]
England is only ever grey or green
The girls glitter striding glorious and coatless in the rain
I remember falling through these streets
Somewhat out of place, if not for the drunkenness
[Pre-Chorus]
It makes my chest hurt to think of it
Not of regret, but of missing that
[Chorus]
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
[Verse 2]
It was not all pain and pavements slick with rain
And shining under lights from shitty clubs and doing shitty drugs
And hugging girls that smelt like Britney Spears and coconuts
[Verse 3]
And with your mermaid hair and your teeth so sharp
You crawled from the sea to break that sailor's heart
You only get one night upon the shore
So dance like you've never danced before
And the dance floor is filling up with blood
But, oh, Lord, you've never been so in love
[Chorus]
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
[Bridge]
And the mermaids, they come once a year
They climb the struts of Brighton Pier
They come to drink, they come to dance
To sacrifice a human heart
And the world is so much wilder than you think
You haven't seen nothing till you seen an English girl drink
[Chorus]
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
Cheerful oblivion
