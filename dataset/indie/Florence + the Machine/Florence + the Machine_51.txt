[Verse 1]
Lost in the fog, these hollow hills
Blood running hot, night chills
Without your love, I'll be
So long and lost, are you missing me?
[Chorus]
Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song
[Verse 2]
I need the clouds to cover me
Pulling them down, surround me
Without your love I'll be
So long and lost, are you missing me?
[Chorus]
Is it too late to come on home?
Are all those bridges now old stone?
Is it too late to come on home?
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song
[Bridge]
It's been so long between the words we spoke
Will you be there up on the shore, I hope
You wonder why it is that I came home
I figured out where I belong
[Chorus]
But it's too late to come on home
Are all those bridges now old stone?
But it's too late to come on home
Can the city forgive? I hear its sad song
