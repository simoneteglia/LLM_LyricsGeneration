[Verse 1]
Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Dragged further away from the shore
And deeper into the drink
[Verse 2]
Sat on the bottom of the ocean
A stern and stubborn rock
Your songs remind me of swimming
But somehow I forgot
[Verse 3]
I was sinking, and now I'm sunk
I was drinking, and now I'm drunk
Your songs remind me of swimming
But somehow I forgot
[Verse 4]
I tried to remember the chorus
I can't remember the verse
'Cause that song that sent me a' swimming
Is now the life jacket that burst
[Verse 5]
Rotting like a wreck on the ocean floor
Sinkin' like a siren that can't swim any more
Your songs remind me of swimming
But I can't swim anymore
[Verse 6]
Pull me out the water, cold and blue
I open my eyes and see that it's you
So I'll dive straight back in the ocean
Yes I'll dive straight back in the ocean
[Verse 7]
Take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
Take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
Then cross my fingers
And hope for the best
[Bridge]
Then all of a sudden, I heard a note
It started in my chest, and ended in my throat, oh
Then I realised
Then I realised
Then I realised
I was swimming
Yes, I was swimming
And now I'm swimming
Yes, I am swimming
[Outro]
Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Oh, your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started
Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started
To sink
