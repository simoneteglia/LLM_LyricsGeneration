[Verse 1]
Holy water
Cannot help you now
A thousand armies
Couldn't keep me out
I don't want your money
I don't want your crown
See, I've come to burn
Your kingdom down
[Pre-Chorus]
Holy water
Cannot help you now
See, I've come to burn
Your kingdom down
And no rivers and no lakes
Can put the fire out
I'm gonna raise the stakes
I'm gonna smoke you out
[Chorus]
Seven devils all around me
Seven devils in my house
See, they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
[Post-Chorus]
Before the day is done
[Verse 2]
And now all your love
Will be exorcized
And we will find new saints
To be canonized
And it's an
evensong
It's a
litany
It's a battle cry
It's a symphony
[Chorus]
Seven devils all around me
Seven devils in my house
See, they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
And I'll be dead before the day is done
[Post-Chorus]
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
[Bridge]
You can't keep it out
It's coming through the walls
To devastate your heart
And to take your soul
For what has been done
Cannot be undone
In the eagle's eye
In the evensong
[Outro]
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See, I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done
