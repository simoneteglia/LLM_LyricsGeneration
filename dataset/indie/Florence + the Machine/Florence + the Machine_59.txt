[Verse 1]
Oh, the river, oh, the river, it's running free
And, oh, the joy, oh, the joy it brings to me
But I know it'll have to drown me
Before it can breathe easy
And I've seen it in the flights of birds, I've seen it in you
In the entrails of the animals, the blood running through
But in order to get to the heart of things
Sometimes, you have to cut through
[Pre-Chorus]
But you can
You can
We can
We can
[Chorus]
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
Keep it up, I know you can
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
'Cause I am
[Verse 2]
Odyssey on odyssey, and land over land
Creeping and crawling like the sea over sand
Still, I follow heart lines on your hand
And this fantasy, this fallacy, this tumbling stone
Echoes of a city that's long overgrown
Your heart is the only place that I call home
Can I be returned?
[Pre-Chorus]
You can
You can
We can
[Chorus]
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
Keep it up, I know you can
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
[Bridge]
What a thing to do
Oh, what a thing to choose
But know, in some way, I'm there with you
Up against the wall on a Wednesday afternoon
[Chorus]
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
Keep it up, I know you can
Just keep following the heart lines on your hand
'Cause I am
