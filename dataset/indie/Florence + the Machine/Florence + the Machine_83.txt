I had a dream that I met you [?] blessed [brother/proverb?] [?] When I look at you, and I feel your staring face, I never close my eyes. And every creature I see reminds me of you. That kind of thinking [?] So, I look outside, and I can see the stars [?] and it reminds me [?] my negativity [?]
And everywhere I go, I see your face, and I hear voices, and it reminds me of you [?]
Oh
I will be
So, I keep climbing
I will be
I will be
I will be
And silence will not cover me
I will be
I will be
Send off a message from us
And silence will not cover me
I will be
I will be
I will be
I will be
And silence will not cover me
And silence will not cover me
I will be
I will be
And silence will not cover me
I will be
I will be
And silence will not cover me
I will be
I will be
And silence will not cover me
I will be
I will be
I will be
I was meant to be
I will be
And silence will not cover me
And silence will not cover me
And silence will not cover me
I will be
I will be
I will be
I will be
