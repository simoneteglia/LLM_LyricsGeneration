[Verse 1]
She told me not to step on the cracks
I told her not to fuss and relax
Well, her pretty little face stopped me in my tracks
[Pre-Chorus]
But now she sleeps with one eye open
That's the price she'll pay
[Verse 2]
I took a knife and cut out her eye
I took it home and watched it wither and die
Well, she's lucky that I didn't slip her a smile
[Pre-Chorus]
That's why she sleeps with one eye open, oh
But that's the price she'll pay
[Chorus]
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out 'cause you made me cry
[Verse 3]
I slipped my hand under her skirt
I said don't worry, it's not gonna hurt
Oh, my reputation's kind of clouded with dirt
[Pre-Chorus]
That's why you sleep with one eye open
But that's the price you'll pay
[Chorus]
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out â€˜cause you made me cry
[Bridge]
You made me cry
You made me cry
You made me cry
[Chorus]
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
And I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
And I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out 'cause you made me cry
