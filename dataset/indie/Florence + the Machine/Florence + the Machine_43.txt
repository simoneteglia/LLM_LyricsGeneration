[Verse 1]
And I came to, walking on the train tracks
How did I get here? And how do I get back?
I've been up all night, let's stay awake
Push it further, you know I'll never break
At some point in the party, I thought my heart was failing
You said, "Hey, you're okay; you seem to be still standing"
Flashes appeared at the corner of my eyes
I saw the stars and I didn't ask why
Heard the voices and caught my breath
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the feeling was always too much for me
It always came too strong
I wanted to get it right so badly that I always got it wrong
So you keep pushing on
You hope it won't be long
'Til you can find the child you were
And find a way to get along
[Chorus]
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
[Verse 2]
And, oh, my little sister, when the drugs were wearing off
I climbed into your bed and said, "I think I did too much"
In some ways that was simpler, being too fucked up to see
I didn't have to wake up to the world that was around me
And now we are awake and it seems too much to take
I want to close my eyes because I fear my heart will break
I want to look away
I want to look away
I want to look away
I must not look away
[Chorus]
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
[Bridge]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-ah
[Outro]
I want to look away
I want to look away
I want to look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
