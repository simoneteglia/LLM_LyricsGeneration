[Verse 1]
No walls can keep me protected
No sleep, nothing in between me and the rain
And you can't save me now
I'm in the grip of a hurricane
I'm going to blow myself away
[Chorus]
I'm going out, I'm going to drink myself to death
And in the crowd, I see you with someone else
I brace myself, because I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse
[Verse 2]
No home, I don't want shelter
No calm, nothing to keep me from the storm
And you can't hold me down
Because I belong to the hurricane
It's going to blow this all away
[Chorus]
I'm going out, I'm going to drink myself to death
And in the crowd, I see you with someone else
I brace myself, because I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse
[Bridge]
I hope that you see me, because I'm staring at you
But when you look over, you look right through
Then you lean and kiss her on the head
And I never felt so alive, and so dead
[Chorus]
I'm going out, I'm going to drink myself to death
And in the crowd, I see you with someone else
I brace myself, because I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out...
I'm going out, I'm going to drink myself to death
And in the crowd, I see you with someone else
I brace myself, because I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out
I'm going out
I'm going out
I'm going out
I'm going out
