[Verse 1]
I believe in you
And in our hearts we know the truth
And I believe in love
And the darker it gets, the more I do
Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light
And the days will become endless
And never, and never turn to night
And never, and never turn to night
[Chorus]
Then it's just too much
I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly
[Verse 2]
We have no need to fight
We raise our voices and let our hearts take flight
Get higher than those planes can fly
Where the stars do not take sides
[Chorus]
Then it's just too much
I cannot get you close enough
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly
[Chorus]
And then it's just too much
The streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly
[Verse 3]
I let him sleep and as he does
My held breath fills the room with love
Hurts in ways I can't describe
My heart bends and breaks so many, many times
And is born again with each sunrise
And is born again with each sunrise
[Interlude]
Funerals were held all over the city
The youth bleed in the square
And women raged as old men fumbled and cried
"We're sorry, we thought you didn't care, oh"
And how does it feel now you've scratched that itch?
How does it feel?
And pulled out all your stitches
Hubris is a bitch
A hundred arms, a hundred years
A hundred arms, a hundred years
[Chorus]
And then it's just too much
The streets, they still run with blood
A hundred arms, a hundred years
You can always find me here
And, Lord, don't let me break this
Let me hold it lightly
Give me arms to pray with
Instead of ones that hold too tightly, yeah
