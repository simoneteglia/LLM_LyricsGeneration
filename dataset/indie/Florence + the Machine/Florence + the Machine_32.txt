[Verse 1]
Time it took us
To where the water was
That’s what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
But oh, my love, don't forsake me
Take what the water gave me
[Chorus]
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
[Verse 2]
And oh, poor Atlas
The world's a beast of a burden
You’ve been holding on a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
That's what the water gave us
[Chorus]
So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
[Verse 3]
'Cause they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You couldn't have it any other way
[Bridge]
'Cause she's a cruel mistress
And a bargain must be made
But oh, my love, don't forget me
When I let the water take me
[Chorus]
So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
