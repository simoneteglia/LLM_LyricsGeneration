[Verse 1]
Hey, look up
Donâ€™t make a spectre of yourself living in that ghoulish light
You are a slave to your own creation
Look up, look up, the spell is broken
[Chorus]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
[Refrain]
But I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And every touch, it magnifies
You pull away; you don't know why
[Verse 2]
Hey, look up
You don't have to be a ghost here amongst the living
You are flesh and blood
And you deserve to be loved, and you deserve what you are given
[Chorus]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
[Refrain]
But I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I'm the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same, I'm trying to change
[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And every touch, it magnifies
You pull away; you don't know why
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And your face is a disguise
But I can see you with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away; you don't know why
[Bridge]
'Cause your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you
[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And every touch, it magnifies
You pull away; you don't know why
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And your face is a disguise
But I can see you with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away; you don't know why
[Bridge]
'Cause your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you
