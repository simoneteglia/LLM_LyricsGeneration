[Verse 1]
I'm sorry I ruined your birthday
I guess I could go back to university
Try and make my mother proud
Stop this phase I'm in, she deems dangerous
and loud
The spelling is a problem
As is the discipline
And I don't think it would be too long
Before I was drunk in Camberwell again
[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry I ruined your birthday, you had turned 18
And the sunshine hit me and I was behaving strangely
All the walls were melting and there were mermaids everywhere
Hearts flew from my hands, and I could see people's feelings
[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved
[Bridge]
And you, you were the one I treated the worst
Only because you loved me the most
We haven't spoken in a long time
I think about it sometimes
I don't know who I was back then
And I hope on hope (hope on hope)
I would never treat anyone like that again
[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved
[Chorus]
Grace, I know you carry us
Grace, and it was such a fucking mess
Grace, I don't say it enough
Grace, you are so loved
[Outro]
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
(Tell me what I can do, I will make it up to you)
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
(Tell me what I can do, I will make it up to you)
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
This is the only thing I've ever had any faith in
