[Verse 1]
Seems that I have been held, in some dreaming state
A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake
No kiss, no gentle word could wake me from this slumber
Until I realize that it was you who held me under
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Felt it in my fist, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids
Shaking through my skull, through my spine and down through my ribs
[Chorus 1]
No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl
so in love with the wrong world
[Verse 2]
And I could hear the thunder and see the lightning crack
All around the world was waking, I never could go back
Because all the walls of dreaming, they were torn wide open
And finally it seemed that the spell was broken
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open
And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open
[Chorus 1]
No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl
so in love with the wrong world
[Chorus 2]
Snow White is stitching up your circuit-boards
Synapse slipping through the hidden door
Snow White is stitching up your circuit-board
[Chorus 1]
No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl
so in love with the wrong world
[Chorus 2]
Snow White's stitching up your circuit-boards
Synapse slipping through the hidden door
Snow White's stitching up your circuit-board
Synapse slipping through the hidden door
