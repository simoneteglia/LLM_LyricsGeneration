[Verse 1]
If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
Screaming in the dark, I howl when we're apart
Drag my teeth across your chest to taste your beating heart

Howl, howl
[Verse 2]

[Outro]
If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground
