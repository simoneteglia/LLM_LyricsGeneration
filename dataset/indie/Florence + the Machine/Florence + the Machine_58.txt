[Verse 1]
And the heart is hard to translate
It has a language of its own
It talks in tongues and quiet sighs
In prayers and proclamations
In the grand deeds of great men and the smallest of gestures
In short shallow gasps
[Pre-Chorus]
But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it
[Chorus]
And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all
[Verse 2]
And it talks to me in tiptoes
And it sings to me inside
It cries out in the darkest night and breaks in the morning light
[Pre-Chorus]
But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it
[Chorus]
And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all
[Chorus]
And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever, but it never makes sense to me at all
[Outro]
No words
Poor language
It doesn't deserve such treatment
And all my stumbling phrases never amounted
To anything worth this feeling
All this heaven never could describe such a feeling as I'm hearing
Words were never so useful
So I was screaming out a language that I never knew existed before
