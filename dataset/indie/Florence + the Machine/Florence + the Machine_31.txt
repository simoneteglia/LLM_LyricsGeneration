[Verse 1]
And I had a dream
About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold and glittering
I threw my arms around her legs
Came to weeping (Came to weeping)
Came to weeping (Came to weeping)
[Pre-Chorus]
And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night
[Chorus]
And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night
[Verse 2]
And the grass was so green against my new clothes
And I did cartwheels in your honor
Dancing on tiptoes
My own secret ceremonials
Before the service began
In the graveyard doing handstands
[Pre-Chorus]
And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
Only if for a night
[Chorus]
And the only solution was to stand and fight
And my body was bruised and I was set alight
But you came over me like some holy rite
And although I was burning, you're the only light
Only if for a night
[Bridge]
My doe, my dear, my darling
Tell me what all the sighing is about
Tell me what all the sighing is about
[Pre-Chorus]
And I heard your voice as clear as day
And you told me I should concentrate
It was all so strange and so surreal
That a ghost should be so practical
[Outro]
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
Only if for a night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, eh, eh)
