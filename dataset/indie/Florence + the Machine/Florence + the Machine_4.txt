[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
At seventeen I started to starve myself
I thought that love was a kind of emptiness
And at least I understood then the hunger I felt
And I didn't have to call it loneliness
[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you need
Oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby
Come on and work it for me
Don't let them get you down
You're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer
But we knew one thing
[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger
)
[Post-Chorus]
And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
Oh but you in all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment
[Verse 2]
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage, give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid
Then it tries to find a home
With people or when I'm alone
Picking it apart
And staring at your phone
[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you need
Oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby
Come on and work it for me
Don't let them get you down
You're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer
But we knew one thing
[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
[Post-Chorus]
And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
Oh and you in all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment I forget to worry
