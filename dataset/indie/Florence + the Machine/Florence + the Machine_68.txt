[Verse 1]
Never really been alive before
I always lived in my head
And sometimes it was easier
Hungover and half-dead
[Chorus]
I'm back in town, why don't we go out?
Let the rats spin around our feet
The full moon shines down on these dirty streets
I'm back in town, why don't we go out
To that ninth street diner?
And carry on slowly, torturing each other
'Cause it's always the same
[Post-Chorus]
I came for the pleasure, but I stayed
Yes, I stayed for the pain
[Verse 2]
It's lit up like a movie scene
That halogen glow
And if you get spat on, that's just your big city baptism
You're the star of the show
[Chorus]
I'm back in town, why don't we go out
And never go to sleep?
Throw our dreams out, let them pile up on the streets
I thought that I was here with you
But it was always just an empty room
'Cause it's always the same
[Post-Chorus]
I came for the pleasure, but I stayed
Yes, I stayed for the pain
