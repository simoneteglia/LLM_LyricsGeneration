[Chorus]
Know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
'Cause I've loved and I've lost
[Verse 1]
I've asked about you
And they told me things
My mind didn't change
I still feel the same
A life with no fun
Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine and you've had yours
We both know, we know
They don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
Can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry tears in the pillow case
Let's all get a little taste
Pushing me away, so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I'll keep thinking you just don't know
Try to run with that, say you're done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
Change the pace and just go slow
[Pre-Chorus]
Won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
[Chorus]
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
'Cause I've loved and I've lost
[Verse 2]
It's my birthday
I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want to
But I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do
You do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though
Don't be so ashamed
I've had mine and you've had yours
We both know, we know
[Chorus]
Know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
'Cause I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost
