[Intro]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I'd like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
[Verse 1]
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn
[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah
[Verse 2]
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight, I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah
(Shake him off)
[Bridge]
And it's hard to dance
With a devil on your back (Shake him off)
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)
It's a fine romance
But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn (Shake him off)
(Oh-woah)
(Oh-woah)
[Breakdown]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause lookin' for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)
Looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)
But what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah
[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah
[Outro]
