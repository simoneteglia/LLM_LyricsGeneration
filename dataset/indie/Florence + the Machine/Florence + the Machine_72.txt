[Verse 1]
I've fallen out of favor
And I've fallen from grace
Fallen out of trees
And I've fallen on my face
Fallen out of taxis
Out of windows too
Fell in your opinion
When I fell in love with you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh
Oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh
[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish for falling
Wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air
To give me some relief
Because falling is not the problem
When I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground
It causes all the grief
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh
Oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh
[Verse 2]
This is a song for a scribbled out name
And my love keeps writing again and again
This is a song for a scribbled out name
And my love keeps writing again and again
And again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again
[Bridge]
I'll dance myself up
Drunk myself down
Found people to love
Left people to drown
I'm not scared to jump
I'm not scared to fall
If there was nowhere to land
I wouldn't be scared
At all
At all
At all
At all
Fall
Fall
[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish for falling
Wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air
To give me some relief
Because falling is not the problem
When I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground
It causes all the grief
