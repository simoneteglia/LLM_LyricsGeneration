[Verse]
All the things that I ran from
I now bring as close to me as I can
Gripping hotel sheets with gritted teeth
My montage of lost things
My shining trinkets of grief
[Chorus]
Why don't you give me a call?
Open my mouth, yes, I'll take it all
And all this work gone to waste
You made me climb, then you shut the gate
