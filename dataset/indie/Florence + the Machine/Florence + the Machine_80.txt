[Intro]
Ehh, oh ohh
Ehh, oh ohh
Ehh, oh ohh
Ehh, oh ohh
[Verse 1]
She can't see the landscape anymore
It's all painted in her grief
All of her history etched out at her feet
Now all of the landscape, it's just an empty place
Acres of longing, mountains of tenderness
[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Because it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
[Verse 2]
She wants the silence, but fears the solitude
She wants to be alone and together with you
So she ran to the lighthouse, hoped that it would help her see
She saw that the lighthouse had been washed out to sea
[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Because it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
[Bridge]
I want to give you back the open sky
Give you back the open sea
Open up the ages, darling, for you to see
[Verse 3]
You put the gun into your mouth to bite
The bullet and spit it out
Because it's running in the family
All the rituals between you and me
[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Because it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me
