[Verse 1]
All alone
It was always there, you see
And even on my own
It was always standing next to me
[Pre-Chorus]
I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?
[Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down
[Verse 2]
All alone
Even when I was a child
I've always known
There was something to be frightened of
[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?
[Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down
[Verse 3]
All alone
On the edge of sleep
My old familiar friend
Comes and lies down next to me
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Smiling in the streetlight
Even with my eyes shut tight
I still see him coming now
[Chorus]
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down
