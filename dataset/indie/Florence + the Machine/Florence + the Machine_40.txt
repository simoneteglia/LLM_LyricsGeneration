[Verse 1]
What a thing to admit
That when someone looks at me with real love
I don't like it very much
Kinda makes me feel like I'm bein' crushed
Is this something that you would like to discuss?
[Chorus]
And it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
If they ever let me out, I'm gonna really let it out
I listen to music from 2006 and feel kind of sick
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with this
[Verse 2]
Remember being in that basement with Tom Vek?
Everyone treated us like little pets
Oh, tell me it's not over yet
And in my darkest fantasies
I am the picture of passivity
Waitin' for you side of stage
Suppressing all my private rage
But as my sister said, I'd probably last six days
[Chorus]
Oh, it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
And if they ever let me out, I'm gonna really let it out
When I decided to wage holy war
It looked very much like staring at my bedroom floor
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with me
And I know I may not look like much
Just another screaming speck of dust
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with us
(Oh God, you're gonna get it)
[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with us
[Bridge]
Oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with us
(Oh God, you're gonna get it)
Oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with me
[Outro]
I met the Devil
You know, he gave me a choice
A golden heart
Or a golden voice
