[Verse 1]
The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is all it takes
You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need
[Chorus]
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You're gonna to have to face it, you're addicted to love
[Verse 2]
See the signs, but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats, double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine
A one-track mind, you can't be saved
'Cause baby a love is all you crave
If there's some left, left for you
Then you don't mind if you do
[Chorus]
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You're gonna to have to face it, you're addicted to love
[Verse 3]
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
The
r lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine
[Chorus]
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't getou know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
[Outro]
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
