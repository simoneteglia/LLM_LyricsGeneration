[Verse 1]
I'm a street-walkin' cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys
[Refrain]
Honey, gotta help me, please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, detonate for me
[Verse 2]
Look out, honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a firefight
[Refrain]
Honey, gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Well, baby, penetrate my mind
[Chorus]
And I am the world's forgotten boy
The onе who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
And honеy, I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
[Verse 3]
Look out, honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Solar radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a firefight
[Refrain]
Honey, gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby, penetrate my mind
[Chorus]
And I am the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
Well, honey, I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
[Outro]
Forgotten boy
Forgotten boy
Forgotten boy
Forgotten boy
