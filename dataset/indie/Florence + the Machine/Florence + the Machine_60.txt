[Verse]
You said this could have been the best thing
That ever happened to you
So you decided not to do it
Now you come back every summer
Like a carnivorous flower
And I stare at your hands in the heat and I
Think they are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen
But if I was free to love you
You wouldn't want me, would you?
Unavailability is the only thing that turns you on
Come here, baby, tell me that I'm wrong
[Chorus]
I've blown apart my life for you
And bodies hit the floor for you
And break me, shake me, devastatе me
Come herе, baby, tell me that I'm wrong
I don't love you, I just love the bomb
Buildings falling is the only thing that turns me on
I've blown apart my life for you
And bodies hit the floor for you
And break me, shake me, devastate me
Come here, baby, tell me that I'm wrong
I don't love you, I just love the bomb (Oh, oh, oh)
I let it burn, but it just had to be done (Oh, oh, oh)
And I'm in ruins, but is it what I wanted all along?
Sometimes, you get the girl, sometimes, you get the song
