[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd be a killer
'Cause there's so much to lose
But if I can't drink the water
What else can I do?
And although the axe is heavy
It just sits in my hands
While you're changing like the current
Not a shore on land
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my hand around
[Chorus]
Make up your mind (make up, make up)
Let me live or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
I've been breaking mine for you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
Make up your mind (make up, make up)
Before I make it up for you
[Verse 2]
I never thought that I'd be facing
A sea that's bluer than the tide
Now my knees are shaking
And I can't look in your eyes
But if you're gonna make me do it
How'd you want it done?
Is it best to sip it slowly
Or drink it down in one?
[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my hand around
[Chorus]
Make up your mind (make up, make up)
Let me live or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
I've been breaking mine for you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
Make up your mind (make up, make up)
Before I make it up for you
[Bridge]
The executioner's within me
And he comes, blindfold ready
Sword in hand
And arms so steady
Every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my hand around
But every time I try to bring it down
You always turn my hand around
[Chorus]
Make up your mind (make up, make up)
Let me live or let me love you
While you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
I've been breaking mine for you
The power is on, the guillotine hums
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
Make up your mind (make up, make up)
Before I make it up for you
Make up your mind (make up, make up)
Let me live or let me love you (let me love you)
While you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
I've been breaking mine for you
(I've been breaking...)
The power is on, the guillotine hums
(I've been breaking...)
My back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
(I've been breaking...)
Make up your mind
(I've been breaking, I've been breaking...)
Before I make it up for you
