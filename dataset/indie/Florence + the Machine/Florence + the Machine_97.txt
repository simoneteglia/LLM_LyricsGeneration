[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
I'm not calling you a thief, just don't steal from me
I'm not calling you a ghost, just stop haunting me
And I love you so much, I'm going to let you kill me
[Chorus 1]
There's a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
Wraps itself around my chest as it softly weeps
And it walks, and it walks with my legs
To fall, to fall, to fall at your feet
[Chorus 2]
There but for the grace of God, go I
And when you kiss me, I am happy enough to die
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you
I'm not calling you a thief, just don't
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you
I'm not calling you a ghost, just stop
[Chorus 1]
There's a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
Wraps itself around my chest as it softly weeps
And it walks, and it walks, and it walks with my legs
[Bridge]
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
To fall, to fall
[Chorus 2]
There but for the grace of God, go I
And when you kiss me, I am happy enough to die
