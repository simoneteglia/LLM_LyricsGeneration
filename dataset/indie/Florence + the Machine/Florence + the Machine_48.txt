[Verse]
Well, I didn't tell anyone, but a bird flew by
Saw what I'd done, he set up a nest outside
And he sang about what I'd become
He sang so loud, sang so clear
I was afraid all the neighbours would hear
So I invited him in, just to reason with him
I promised I wouldn't do it again
But he sang louder and louder inside the house
And no I couldn't get him out
So I trapped him under a cardboard box
Stood on it to make him stop
I picked up the bird and above the din I said
"That's the last song you'll ever sing"
Held him down, broke his neck
Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget
But in my dreams began to creep
That old familiar tweet, tweet, tweet
[Chorus 1]
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
Couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
[Chorus 2]
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
The song was coming from my mouth
[Outro]
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
From my mouth
