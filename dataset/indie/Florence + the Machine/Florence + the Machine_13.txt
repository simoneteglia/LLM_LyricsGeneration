[Verse 1]
Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
Dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
Here comes a killer whale, to sing me to sleep
Thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?
[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
[Verse 2]
What's with the long face? Do you want more?
Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
And don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
The chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?
[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
[Bridge]
And good God
Under starless skies we are lost
And into the breach we got tossed
And the water's coming in fast
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I said?
I can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
And, oh, my love remind me, what was it that I did?
Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch?
Did I build a ship to wreck?
[Chorus]
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
To wreck, to wreck, to wreck
Did I build this ship to wreck?
