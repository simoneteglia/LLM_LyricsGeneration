[Verse 1]
I used to see the future and now I see nothin'
They cut out my eyes and sent me home packin'
To pace around the kitchen for scraps of inspiration
Cryin' like Cassandra, I
I used to tell the future, but they cut out my tongue
And left me doin' laundry to think on what I'd done
It wasn't me, it was the song
[Verse 2]
I used to move into the future and bring it all back
Let it bleed through my fingers, a treasure in my hands
Now I creep out when there's no one about
'Cause they put crosses on the doors to try and keep me out
The gardеn's overgrown
And I run in the middle of thе road (Ooh)
[Chorus]
Well, can you see me?
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
In this blindness I'm condemned to
Well, can you hear me?
I cannot hear you
Every song I thought I knew, I've been deafened to
And there's no one left to sing to
[Verse 3]
All the gods have been domesticated
And Heaven is now overrated
And the churches, they all closed their doors
But you can take your complaints straight to the Lord
I try to still look with wonder on the world
As the roses bloom
And the riot van still plainly in view
[Chorus]
Well, can you see me?
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
In this blindness that I'm condemned to
Well, can you hear me?
I cannot hear you
Every song I thought I knew, I've been deafened to
And there's no one left to sing to
[Bridge]
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh, oh)
Take me back (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh,
drunken gods of slaughter (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You know I've always been your favourite daughter
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
Well, can you see me?
I cannot see you
Everything I thought I knew has fallen out of view
And if I run fast enough
Could I break apart
As empires crumble and cathedrals flatten in my heart?
