[Intro]
Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
She's born to be bad, so run for the hills
Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
The fear on your face, it gives me a thrill
[Verse 1]
Who wants to be nice?
Who wants to be tame?
All of your good guys, they all seem the same
[Verse 2]
Original, criminal, dressed to kill
Just call me Cruella de Vil
Call me crazy, call me insane
But you're stuck in the past
And I'm ahead of the game
[Verse 3]
A life lived in penance, it just seems a waste
And the devil has much better taste
And I tried to be sweet, I tried to be kind
But I feel much better now that I'm out of my mind
[Verse 4]
Well, there's always a line at the gates of Hell
But I go right to the front 'cause I dress this well
Rip it up, leave it all in tatters
Beauty is the only thing that matters
The fabric of your little world is torn
Embrace the darkness and be reborn
[Outro]
Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
The fear on your face, it gives me a thrill
