[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
I was looking for a breath of a life
For a little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh
To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start and the end
But all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh
[Verse 1]
But I needed one more touch
Another taste of heavenly rush
And I believe, I believe it's so, oh oh oh
And I needed one more touch
Another taste of divine rush
And I believe, I believe it's so, oh oh oh
Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?
Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?
And the fever began to spread
From my heart down to my legs
But the room is so quiet, oh oh oh oh
And although I wasn't losing my mind
It was a chorus so sublime
But the room is so quiet, oh oh oh (And the fever)
[Chorus]
I was looking for a breath of a life
For a little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh (I believe it)
To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start and the end
But all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh
[Interlude]
(
And the fever dream of life
)
(
And the chorus so sublime
)
(
And the room was so quiet
)
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a harder way and it's come to claim her
And I always say, we should be together
And I can't sleep alone, because there's something in here
And if you are gone, I will not belong here (Belong, belong, belong)
[Verse 2]
And I started to hear it again
But this time it wasn't the end
And the room is so quiet, oh oh oh oh
And my heart is a hollow plain
For the devil to dance again
And the room is too quiet, oh oh oh oh
[Outro]
I was looking for a breath of a life
For a little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh
