[Verse 1]
Another conversation with no destination
Another battle never won
And each side is a loser
So who cares who fired the gun?
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Letting loss reveal it
Letting loss reveal it
[Chorus]
St. Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St. Jude, we were lost before she started
St. Jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
St. Jude, maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos
[Verse 2]
And I was on the island and you were there too
But somehow through the storm I couldn't get to you
St. Jude, somehow she knew
And she came to give her blessing while causing devastation
And I couldn't keep my mouth shut, I just had to mention
Grabbing your attention
[Chorus]
St. Jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
St. Jude, we were lost before she started
St. Jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
St. Jude, maybe I've always been more comfortable in chaos
[Bridge]
St. Jude, St. Jude
St. Jude, St. Jude
[Outro]
And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Letting loss reveal it
Letting loss reveal it
And I'm learning, so I'm leaving
And even though I'm grieving
I'm trying to find the meaning
Letting loss reveal it
Letting loss reveal it
