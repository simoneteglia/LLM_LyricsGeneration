[Verse 1]
I was on a heavy tip
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wondering what to do with life
[Verse 2]
I'd already had a sip
So I reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?
[Verse 3]
To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door
[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
[Verse 4]
You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more
[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
(And with one kiss)
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
(For twenty years)
What kind of man loves like this?
[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
[Verse 5]
But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
"Oh mercy", I implore
"Oh mercy", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall
[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
Back, back, back against the wall
[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
