[Verse 1]
I was always able to write my way out
The song always made sense to me
Now I find that when I look down
Every page is empty
There is nothing to describe
Except the moon still bright against the worrying sky
I pray the trees will get their leaves soon
[Chorus]
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
[Verse 2]
And when it came, it was stranger than I had ever imagined
No cracking open of Heaven
But quiеt and still (All my friends are getting ill)
[Chorus]
So tеll me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
[Post-Chorus]
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The billboards emptied
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The buildings emptied
[Chorus]
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?
I don't know where to put my love
[Post-Chorus]
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The billboards emptied
My arms emptied, the skies emptied
The buildings emptied
