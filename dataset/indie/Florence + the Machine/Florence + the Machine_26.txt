[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
[Verse 1]
Hey, look up
Don't make a shadow of yourself
Always shutting out the light
Caught in your own creation
Look up, look up
It tore you open
And oh, how much?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why
[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
[Verse 2]
Hey, look up
You don't have to be a ghost
Here amongst the living
You are flesh and blood
And you deserve to be loved
And you deserve what you are given
And oh, how much?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why
[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why
[Chorus 1]
That original lifeline
Original lifeline
That original lifeline
That original lifeline
[Bridge]
'Cause your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you
But your pain is a tribute
The only thing you let hold you
Wear it now like a mantle
Always there to remind you
[Chorus 2]
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a hole where your heart lies
And I can see it with my third eye
And though my touch, it magnifies
You pull away, you don't know why
[Outro]
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I'm the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
Original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
I am the same, I'm the same
I'm trying to change
That original lifeline
