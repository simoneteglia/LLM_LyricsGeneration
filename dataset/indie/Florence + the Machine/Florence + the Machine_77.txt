[Verse 1]
Hydrogen in our veins, it cannot hold itself, our blood is burning
And the pressure in our bodies that echoes up above it is exploding
And our particles they're burning up because they yearn for each other
And although we stick together, it seems that we are stranging one another
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)
See it on me, love, see it on me, love, see it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)
And atom to atom
Oh, can you feel it on me, love?
And a pattern to pattern
Oh, can you see it on me, love?
Atom to atom
Oh, what's the matter with me, love?
(Strangeness and Charm)
[Chorus]
The static of your arms, it is the catalyst
Oh the chemical it burns, there is nothing but this
It's the purest element, but it's so volatile
An equation heaven sent, a drug for angels
Strangeness and Charm
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)
See it on me, love, see it on me, love, see it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)
And atom to atom
Oh, can you feel it on me, love?
And a pattern to pattern
Oh, can you see it on me, love?
Atom to atom
Oh, what's the matter with me, love?
(Strangeness and Charm)
[Chorus]
The static of your arms, it is the catalyst
Oh the chemical it burns, there is nothing but this
It's the purest element, but it's so volatile
An equation heaven sent, a drug for angels
Strangeness and Charm
[Bridge]
Strangeness and Charm
Hey— so cold! (Strangeness and Charm)
Hey— so cold! (Strangeness and Charm)
Hey— so cold! (Strangeness and Charm)
Hey— (Strangeness and Charm)
[Chorus]
Strangeness and Charm
The static of your arms, it is the catalyst
Oh the chemical it burns, there is nothing but this
It's the purest element, but it's so volatile
An equation heaven sent
, a drug for angels
Feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)
See it on me, love, see it on me, love, see it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)
Feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love, feel it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)
See it on me, love, see it on me, love, see it on me, love
(
Strangeness and Charm
)

Down... down, down, down
Ho, ho...
Down... down, down, down
Ho, ho...
Down... down, down, down
Ho!
