[Verse 1]
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Givin' us the old heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go it's sleepy time
[Pre-Chorus]
This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening
[Chorus]
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword
[Verse 2]
She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love
[Pre-Chorus]
This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening
[Chorus]
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword
[Interlude]
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
[Refrain]
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Where'd you put the keys, girl?
[Bridge]
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
[Refrain]
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Oh, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys? Oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Where'd you put the keys, girl?
