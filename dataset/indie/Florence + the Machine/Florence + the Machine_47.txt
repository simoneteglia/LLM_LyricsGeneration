[Verse 1]
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
To try and keep from calling you
Well, can my dreams keep coming true?
How can they?
'Cause when I sleep, I never dream of you
[Pre-Chorus 1]
As if the dream of you, it sleeps too
But it never slips away
It just gains its strength and digs its hooks
To drag me through the day
[Chorus]
And I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will
[Verse 2]
It's the hardest thing I've ever had to prove
You turned to salt as I turned around to look at you
Old friends have said, the books I've read
Say it's the thing to do
But it's hard to see it when you're in it
'Cause I went blind for you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then you leave my head, crawl out the bed
You subconscious solipsist
And for those hours deep in the dark
Perhaps you don't exist
[Chorus]
But I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will
[Bridge]
And I'm thrashing on the line
Somewhere between
Desperate and divine
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Persephone will have her fill
[Chorus]
But I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will
[Chorus]
But I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will
