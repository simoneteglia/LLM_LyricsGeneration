[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a child
I've turned it over in my mind
I sang by the piano
Tore my yellow dress and
Cried and cried and cried
[Pre-Chorus]
Now to unsee what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come, come
[Chorus]
Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
Over the love of you
[Verse 2]
All this champagne drunken home
Against the current of gold
Everybody see I love him
Cause it's a feeling that you get
When the afternoon is set
On the bridge into the city
[Pre-Chorus]
And now to unsee what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come
[Chorus]
Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
[Bridge]
Because you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in my way
But I'll get around it, I'll get around it
Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it
[Chorus]
Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
Over the love of you
[Outro]
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes
