[Intro]
I love you all the time
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, ah
[Verse 1]
I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time
I'm fueled up and high, I'm out with the guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time
[Chorus]
I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I can tell you're going to take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay
[Verse 2]
Ce soir c’est le soir
Et toi avec moi
Et tu viens me voir
Tu viens, oh la la
I love you all the time
Tu ne réponds pas
Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Just say au revoir
Again me voilà
I love you all the time
[Chorus]
And I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I can tell you're going to take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
[Outro]
Ah
dites-moi pourquoi
Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Ah dites-moi pourquoi
