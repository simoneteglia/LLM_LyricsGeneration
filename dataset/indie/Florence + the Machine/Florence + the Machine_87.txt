[Verse 1]
I was born in a big grey cloud
Screaming out a love song
All the broken chords and unnamed cries
What a place to come from
I wish to remain nameless
And live without shame
'Cause what's in a name, boy?
I still remain the same
[Chorus]
You can call it what you want
You can call me anything you want
You can call us what you want
You can call me anything you want
[Verse 2]
Everybody lets you down
What you want? What you want?
In this brief hole of a town
All the different souls rushing out
What you want? What you want?
Tell me what you're running from
I know everybody lets you down
And I'll do the same
I'll do the same
But know I'll always be around
This can remain the same
What you want? What you want?
[Chorus]
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me, call me when you need me
Call me anything you want
Call me when you need me, call me when you need me
Darling believe me
Darling believe me, darling believe me
Nothing I haven't done before
Darling believe me, darling believe me
[Bridge]
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Darling believe me
Darling believe me
Darling believe me
Darling believe me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
I wish to remain nameless
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Darling believe me
Darling believe me
I wish to remain nameless
Call me when you need me
Darling believe me
[Outro]
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Darling believe me
Believe me
Darling believe me
Darling believe me
Darling believe me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
Darling believe me
Believe me
Darling believe me
Call me when you need me
Darling believe me
Call me when you need me
Call me when you need me
