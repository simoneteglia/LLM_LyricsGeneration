[Verse 1]
And it's hard to write about being happy
'Cause the older I get
I find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject
[Chorus]
And there would be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus could come in
About two people sitting doing nothing
[Verse 2]
But I must confess
I did it all for myself
I gathered you here to hide from some vast unnameable fear
But the loneliness never left me
I always took it with me
But I can put it down in the pleasure of your company
[Chorus]
And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
It will be entirely forgotten
[Verse 3]
And if tomorrow it's all over
At least we had it for a moment
Oh, darling, things seem so unstable
But for a moment we were able to be still
[Chorus]
And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
This will be entirely forgotten
[Non-Lyrical Vocal Outro]
