[Verse 1]
This is as good a place to fall as any
Will you build our altar here?
Make me your Maria
I'm already on my knees
You had Jesus on your breath
And I caught him in mine
Sweating out confessions
The undone and the divine, cause
[Pre-Chorus]
This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers
And I can't get enough
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, yeah, ah, ah
[Verse 2]
Spilt milk tears
I did this for you
Spilling over the idol
The black and the blue
The sweetest submission
Drinking it in
The wine, the women, the bedroom hymns
[Pre-Chorus]
This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers
And I can't get enough
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, ah, ah
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough
[Bridge]
I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I found myself an old solution
I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I found myself an old solution
[Pre-Chorus]
This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers
And I can't get enough
This is his body
This is his love
Such selfish prayers
And I can't get enough
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, yeah
And I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah
I can't get enough
Whoa, whoa, yeah, ah, ah
