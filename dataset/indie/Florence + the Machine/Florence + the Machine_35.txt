[Verse 1]
And it's my whole heart
Weighed and measured inside
And it's an old scar
Trying to bleach it out
And it's my whole heart
Deemed and delivered a crime
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
[Pre-Chorus]
Who's a heretic now?
Am I making sense?
How can you make it stick?
Waiting 'til the beat comes out
Who's a heretic, child?
Can you make it stick, now?
And I'm on trial
Waiting 'til the beat comes out
[Chorus]
I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
Crawling all the way
Crawling all the way
[Post-Chorus]
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget
[Verse 2]
And it's my whole heart
While tried and tested, it's mine
And it's my whole heart
Trying to reach it out
And it's my whole heart
Burned but not buried this time
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
I'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
(You're shit aah!)
[Chorus]
I'm miles away, he's on my mind
I'm getting tired of crawling all the way and
I've had enough, it's obvious
And I'm getting tired of crawling all the way
[Post-Chorus]
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met
Fire, help me to forget
I'm not beaten by this yet
You can't tell me to regret
Been in the dark since the day we met (You're shit aah!)
Fire, help me to forget
[Outro]
Chained and shackled, oh
I'll unravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
Never to return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Chained and shackled, oh
I'll unravel, oh
It's a pity, oh
Say I won't return
But I never learn
It's a pity, oh
Ooh...
