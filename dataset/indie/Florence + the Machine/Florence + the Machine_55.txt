[Intro]
I couldn't help it, yes, I let it get in
The helpless optimism of spring
Worn out and tired and my heart near retired
And the world bent double from weeping
And yet, the birds begin to sing
Ooh, ooh, oh

Daffodil
[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil
[Verse 1]
We practice resurrection every night
Raising the dead under the moonlight
And in the gloaming, I start to cry
You're a perfect pearl hung in the sky
[Pre-Chorus]
There is no bad, there is no good

There is no bad, there is no good
I drank every sky that I could
Made myself mythical, tried to be real
Saw the future in the face of a
[Chorus]
Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil
Daffodil
