[Verse 1]
When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours on our skin
We were light and paper thin
And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours in our skin
Until we let the spectrum in
[Pre-Chorus]
Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
[Chorus]
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
[Verse 2]
And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms
And when it's time to pray
We'll be dressed up all in grey
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs
[Pre-Chorus]
Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
[Chorus]
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
[Bridge]
And when we come back we'll be dressed in black
And you'll scream our names aloud
And we won't eat and we won't sleep
We'll drag bodies from the ground
[Refrain]
So say my name
And every colour illuminates
And we are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
[Chorus]
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
[Outro]
Say my name
We are shining
Say my name
Say my name
And we will never be afraid again
