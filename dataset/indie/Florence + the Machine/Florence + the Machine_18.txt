[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes, I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, it seems the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then, it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone, you are my daily need, oh
When friends are gone, I know my savior's love is real
You know it's real
[Chorus]
'Cause you've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
[Verse 3]
Time after time I think, "Oh, Lord, what's the use?"
Time after time, I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love, you lose
But you've got the love I need to see me through
[Chorus]
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love and you've got the love
[Outro]
Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you, oh
Sometimes, I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through
