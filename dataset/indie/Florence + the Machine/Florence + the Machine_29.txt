[Verse 1]
And the air was full
Of various storms and saints
Parading in the streets
As the banks began to break
And I'm in the throes of it
Somewhere in the belly of the beast
But you took your toll on me
So I gave myself over willingly
You got a hold on me
I don't know how I don't just stand outside and scream
I am teaching myself how to be free
[Verse 2]
The monument of the memory
You tear it down in your head
Don't make the mountain your enemy
Get out, get up there instead
You saw the stars out in front of you
Too tempting not to touch
But even though it shocked you
Something's electric in your blood
[Pre-Chorus]
Can people just untie themselves
Uncurling like flowers
If you could just forgive yourself
[Chorus]
But still you stumble, your feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
Sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart, don't give it away
[Verse 3]
Now find a rooftop to sing from
Now find a hallway to dance
You don't need no edge to cling from
Your heart is there, it's in your hands
I know it seems like forever
I know it seems like an age
But one day this will be over
I swear it's not so far away
[Pre-Chorus]
Can people just untie themselves
Uncurling like flowers
If you could just forgive yourself
[Chorus]
But still you stumble, your feet give way
Outside the world seems a violent place
But you had to have him, and so you did
Some things you let go in order to live
While all around you, the buildings sway
Sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
I know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
Hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
Hold on to your heart
