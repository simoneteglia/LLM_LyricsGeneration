[Verse 1]
And the crown, it weighs heavy
'Til it's banging on my eyelids
Retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, who decides from where up high?
I couldn't say "I need more time"
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
Or one more day inside this life
[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough
[Verse 2]
Oh, you wondrous creature
Coming up who we are
'Cause I'm retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss
[Pre-Chorus]
And who decides from where up high?
(One other year, a hundred flags flying in a field)
I couldn't say "I need more time"
(One day, felt it let go of me)
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
(One other year, a hundred flags flying in a field)
Or one more day inside this life
(One day, felt it let go of me)
[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough
[Bridge]
And who cares about the thing I did that night?
So what? Maybe Luna had it right
And who cares if I'm coming back alive?
So what? 'Least I have the strength to fight
[Chorus]
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, ever enough
[Outro]
One other year, a hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me
One other year, a hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me
A hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me
One other year, a hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me
