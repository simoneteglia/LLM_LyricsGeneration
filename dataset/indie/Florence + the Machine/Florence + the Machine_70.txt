[Verse 1]
I'm not calling you a liar
Just don't lie to me
I'm not calling you a thief
Just don't steal from me
I'm not calling you a ghost
Just stop haunting me
And I love you so much
I'm going to let you kill me
[Chorus]
There's a ghost in my lungs
And it sighs in my sleep
Wraps itself around my tongue
As it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks
With my legs
To fall, to fall
To fall, at your feet
[Post-Chorus]
Oh but for the grace of God go on
And when you kiss me I'm happy enough to die
[Verse 2]
I'm not calling you a liar
Just don't lie to me
And I love you so much
I'm going to let you (kill me)
I'm not calling you a thief
Just stop—
And I love you so much
I'm going to let you—
I'm not calling you a ghost
Just stop—
[Chorus]
There's a ghost in my mouth
And it talks in my sleep
Wraps itself around my tongue
As it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks
Then it walks, with my legs
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
To fall, to fall—
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
To fall, to fall, at your feet
[Post-Chorus]
Oh but for the grace of God go on
And when you kiss me I'm happy enough—
