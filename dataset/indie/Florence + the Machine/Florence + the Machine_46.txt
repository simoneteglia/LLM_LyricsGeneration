[Intro]
Oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this
[Verse 1]
How I long for the autumn
The sun keeps burning me
Every stone in this city keeps reminding me, oh
Can you protect me from what I want?
The lover I let in who left me so lost
[Chorus 1]
Mother, make me
Make me a big tall tree
So I can shed my leaves and let it blow through me
Mother, make me
Make me a big grey cloud
So I can rain on you things I can't say out loud
[Verse 2]
All these couples are kissing
And I can't stand the heat
I lost my shoes and left the party
I wandered in the street
I put my feet into the fountain
The statues all asleep
No use wishing on the water
It grants you no relief
[Chorus 2]
Mother, make me
Make me a bird of prey
So I can rise above this, let it fall away
Mother, make me
Make me a song so sweet
Heaven trembles, falling at my feet
[Outro]
Oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this
Oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me on my knees?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
And it belongs to me
And oh Lord, won't you leave me
Leave me just like this?
'Cause I belong to the ground now
I want no more than this
