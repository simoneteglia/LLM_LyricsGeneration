[Verse 1]
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star
And I have to tell you something
I'm still afraid of the dark
But you take my hand in your hand
From you the flowers grow
And do you understand with every seed you sow
You make this cold world beautiful?
[Pre-Chorus]
You told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
You told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
[Chorus]
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
[Verse 2]
Well, you're a 'real man', and you do what you can
You only take as much as you can grab with two hands
With your big heart, you praise God above
But how's that working out for you, honey?
Do you feel loved?
[Pre-Chorus]
She told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
Do you feel loved? Do you feel loved?
She told me all doors are open to the believer
I believe her, I believe her, I believe her
Do you feel loved?
[Chorus]
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh
[Outro]
I drink too much coffee and think of you often
In a city where reality has long been forgotten
And are you afraid? 'Cause I'm terrified
But you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing to love
It's such a wonderful thing
