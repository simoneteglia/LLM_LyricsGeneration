[Verse 1]
I've been losing sleep
I've been keeping myself awake
I've been wandering the streets
For days and days and days
[Chorus]
Going from road to road
Bed to bed
Lover to lover
And black to red
But I believe
I believe
[Post-Chorus]
There's no salvation for me now
No space among the clouds
And I feel I'm heading down
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
[Verse 2]
And I've been taking chances
I've been setting myself up for the fall
I've been keeping secrets
From my heart and from my soul
[Chorus]
Going from road to road
Bed to bed
Lover to lover
And black to red
But I believe
I believe
[Post-Chorus]
There's no salvation for me now
No space among the clouds
And I feel I'm heading down
But that's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
[Chorus]
Road to road, bed to bed
And lover to lover and black to red
And road to road, bed to bed
And lover to lover
[Bridge]
No space among the clouds
And I feel I'm heading down
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
[Chorus]
Yeah, road to road, bed to bed
And lover to lover and black to red
And road to road, bed to bed
Lover to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover
To lover, to lover, to lover, to lover (Woo-hoo)
[Outro]
No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
No salvation for me now
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
