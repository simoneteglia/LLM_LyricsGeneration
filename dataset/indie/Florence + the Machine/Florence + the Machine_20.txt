[Verse 1]
Oh, the king
Gone mad within his suffering
Called out for release
Someone cure him of his grief
His only son
Cut down, but the battle won
Oh, what is it worth
When all that's left is hurt?
[Pre-Chorus]
Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep
[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away
[Verse 2]
Oh, the queen of peace
Always does her best to please
It isn't any use
Somebody's gotta lose
Like a long scream
Out there, always echoing
Oh, what is it worth?
All that's left is hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep
[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away
[Bridge]
And my love is no good
Against the fortress that it made of you
Blood is running deep
Sorrow that you keep
[Chorus]
Suddenly I'm overcome (Overcome)
Dissolving like the setting sun (The setting sun)
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run (On the run)
The damage is already done (Already done)
Come on, is this what you want?
'Cause you're driving me away
[Spoken Word - Music Video Only]
To give yourself over to another body
That's all you want really
To be out of your own and consumed by another
To swim inside the skin of your lover
Not to have to breathe, not to have to think
But you can't live on love; salt water's no drink
