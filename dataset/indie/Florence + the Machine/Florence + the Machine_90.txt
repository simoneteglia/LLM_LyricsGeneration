[Verse 1]
Are you hurting the one you love?
You say you've found Heaven, but you can't find God
Are you hurting the one you love?
Bite your tongue until it tastes like blood
Are you hurting the one you love?
So many glasses on the tabletop
Are you hurting the one you love?
You'd like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough
[Chorus]
Tough
It's just too tough
Tough
It's just too tough
[Verse 2]
Are you hurting the one you love?
When they watched the walls, and the ticking clock
Are you hurting the one you love?
And was it something you could not stop
[Chorus]
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
Stop
Could not stop
[Verse 3]
Are you hurting the one you love?
When you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground
Are you hurting the one you love?
And lost for themselves
Are you hurting the one you love?
And if heaven knows, then who will stop?
Are you hurting the one you love?
You said you got to heaven, but it wasn't enough
