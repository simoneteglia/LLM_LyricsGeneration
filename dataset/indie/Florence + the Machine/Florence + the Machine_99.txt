With a donkey on my shoulder
And a jackal on my back
I'll carry these, my children
Keep them safe from attack
The donkey makes it hard to dance
The jackal sings too loud
The donkey cries when it's alone
And the jackal is too proud
[Chorus]
Little donkey's getting restless
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal, spoiled and spiteful
Keeps biting at my nose
I would have a lover, a husband, and a child
But the donkey is too jealous
And the jackal is too loud
You ask me why I keep them
Why I love them so
Why they get away with murder
As they grow and grow and grow
I keep them cause I made them
They come from in my heart
With each mistake I make
Created and torn apart
And when it's time to feed them
Before they go to bed
I give them my confessions
Baked within their bread
[Chorus]
Little donkey's getting restless
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal, spoiled and spiteful
Keeps biting at my nose
Little donkey's getting restless
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal, spoiled and spiteful
Keeps biting at my nose
