[Verse 1]
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the Moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[Chorus]
So, darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me
[Verse 2]
If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[Chorus]
And darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me
[Chorus]
And darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me
Stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me
[Chorus]
And darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me
Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me
Stand by me
