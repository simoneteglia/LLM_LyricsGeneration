[Verse 1]
I tried to leave it all behind me
But I woke up and there they were beside me
And I don't believe it but I guess it's true
Some feelings, they can travel too
Oh there it is again, sitting on my chest
Makes it hard to catch my breath
I scramble for the light of change
[Pre-Chorus]
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
[Chorus]
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here
[Verse 2]
And if I stay, oh, I don't know
There'll be so much that I'll have to let go
You're disappearing all the time
But I still see you in the light
For you, the shadows fight
And it's beautiful but there's that tug inside
I must stop time traveling, you're always on my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
[Chorus]
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here
[Bridge]
We all need something watching over us
Be it the falcons, the clouds
or the cross
And then the sea swept in and left us all speechless
Speechless
[Chorus]
And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here
[Post-Chorus]
Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
I wish that you...
