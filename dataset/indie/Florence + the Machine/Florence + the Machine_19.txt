[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wonder if I should be medicated
If I would feel better just lightly sedated
The feeling comes so fast and I cannot control it
I'm on fire, but I'm trying not to show it
[Refrain]
As it picks me up, puts me down
It picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, it puts me down
A hundred times a day
It picks me up, puts me down
Chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up, it puts me down
[Verse 2]
I'm always running from something
I push it back, but it keeps on coming
And being clever never got me very far
Because it's all in my head
"You're too sensitive," they said
I said, "Okay, but let's discuss this at the hospital"
[Refrain]
As it picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, puts me down
Picks me up, it puts me down
A hundred times a day
Picks me up, puts me down
Chews me up, spits me out
It picks me up, puts me down
[Chorus]
But I hear the music, I feel the beat
And for a moment, when I'm dancing, I am free
I hear the music, I feel the beat
And for a moment, when I'm dancing
I am free
I am free
[Bridge]
Is this how it is?
Is this how it's always been?
To exist in the face of suffering and death
And somehow still keep singing?
Oh, like Christ up on a cross
Who died for us, who died for what?
Oh, don't you wanna call it off?
But there is nothing else that I know how to do
But to open up my arms and give it all to you
[Chorus]
'Cause I hear the music, I feel the beat
And for a moment, when I'm dancing
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
