[Verse 1]
Summer holiday, having fun
Happiness is between two buns
Feeling funky on a rolling boil
Smiles bend all over, can't control how I feel
[Chorus]
It's just you and me now
[Verse 2]
Round of kimonos for my girls in the sun
Sending videos to friends in London
Strut like Stellan Skarsgård to and from the bar
Playing my candied tangerine Telecaster
[Chorus]
It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now
[Verse 3]
Two hot palms pressing down on my face
Dragged by my sockets to a better place
Flashing in the dark, my luminescent tongue
Summer holiday, having fun
[Chorus]
It's just you and me now
It's just you and me now
[Outro]
Ooh, I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rest of my lifе
I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rеst of my life
I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rest of my life
I could hold on to the memory of that day for the rest of my life
