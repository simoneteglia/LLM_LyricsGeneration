[Verse 1]
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine, your fever’s gripped me again
Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops (La la la la)
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey (La la la la)
Break down, now weep, build up breakfast
Now let’s eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)
[Chorus]
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me, but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And I, ah-ah-ah-ah
[Verse 2]
Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey (La la la la)
Break down, now sleep, build up breakfast
Now let’s eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)
She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She’s morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love (La la la la)
[Chorus]
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me, but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And I, ah-ah-ah-aha
Aah-ah-ah-ah, Aah-ah-ah-ah-aha-I (Shhhh)
[Verse 3]
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germolene, disinfect the scene, my love, my love, love, love
But please don't go, I love you so, my lovely
[Refrain]
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart (Hey!)
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart
[Outro]
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so
