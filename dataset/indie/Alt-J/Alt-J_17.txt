[Verse 1]
No space
L-shaped
Tetris
Tile seeking
Somewhere
Oh, somewhere
To fit in
Alien (
C'mon
)
[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
[Verse 2]
AK
Twenty
Four-seven
Civilian
[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
[Verse 3]
Jeremiah
Looking down, and you know where you’re looking on down
Do you know where you go?
You’re headed on the strings for the E-X-T-I-N-C-T
Jeremiah
Looking down, but you know where you’re looking, but you go
Do you know where you go?
You’re headed on the strings for the E-X-T-I-N-C-T
[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh, coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
