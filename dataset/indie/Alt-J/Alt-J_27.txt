[Verse 1: Joe Newman]
January came and took my heart away
February felt the same
March, my hugs became hold ons
April, I huffed like porridge on the boil
Morning May, I'm downwind from your shampoo
Ichi, ni, san, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyuu, jyuu
June, I learned to count to ten in Japanese
Dry July, like wiping skin from my skull
Instead, I visit family
They told me I'm special
Hmm
Augustus
came and
stabilised me with my father's pain
Relieving drug, diazepam
Life floats away
October, I swam back for my birthday
Firework display in a cafeteria of my old school
Happier my coal-black sleep in my cold, deep bed
December, you sang at my funeral
[Verse 2: Marika Hackman]
If it's depths to your rivers, I've picked one for you
Oh, greedy with Ss but equalled by Is
If it's stones for your pockets, I've collected a few
To hold you down
To hold you down
[Refrain: Marika Hackman]
Mississippi, come back to me
Oh, Mississippi, your coal-black sleep
Oh, Mississippi
[Bassoon Solo]
[Refrain: Joe Newman and Marika Hackman]
Mississippi, come back to me
Oh, Mississippi from your cold black sleep
Oh, Mississippi
