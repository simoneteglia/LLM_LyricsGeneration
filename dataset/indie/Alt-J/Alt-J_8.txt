[Intro]
This is from
This is from
This is from Matilda
[Verse 1]
Just like Johnny Flynn said
"The breath I've taken and the one I must" to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand,
so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top-to-toe with her success
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, this is from
This is from
This is from Matilda
[Chorus]
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
[Verse 2]
Just like Johnny Flynn said
"The breath I've taken and the one I must" to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand,
so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top-to-toe with her success
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, this is from
This is from
This is from Matilda
[Chorus]
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
[Bridge]
Elle a besoin de toi
Cela vient de Matilda
[Chorus]
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
And she needs you
This is from Matilda
And she needs you (This is from Matilda)
This is from Matilda
[Outro]
This is from Matilda
This is from Matilda
Matilda
Matilda
Matilda
