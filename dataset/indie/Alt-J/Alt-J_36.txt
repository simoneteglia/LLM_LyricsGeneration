[Chorus]
Your sting red-full-stops my skin
Dotted, scratch, scratch, now I'm bleeding
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings
[Interlude]
"Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin."
[Verse]
There's bears in the wood and they're out to get me
And I'm safe from harm if I stay in this chalet
And hold me tight and I'll sink in
I'm absorbed in your thinking
[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't know
You...
But you don't know
You...
[Chorus]
Your sting red-full-stops my skin
Dotted, scratch, scratch, now I'm bleeding
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings
[Outro]
For you...
For you...
