[Verse 1]
More together than alone
From the hill, we saw it rain on the town over
Torch to your chin lights your cheekbones
In that moment, I saw a likeness to our father
[Refrain]
In American Night, on that hill
In the night
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Pulled back to the night before
When the TV lit our brilliant, smiling faces
Torch hits your face before the fall
Panic in the eye is similar to breaking horses
[Interlude]
(An apparition lifts me up!)
[Verse 3]
An apparition lifts me up
From its shoulders, I sit and see your face above the tree line
Your reassurances, subtitled in American English
I am calm as we sail down the hillside
[Outro]
In American Night, on that hill
In the night
