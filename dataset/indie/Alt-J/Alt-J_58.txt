[Verse 1: Tuka]
You called me today, you told me you were gonna die
(Father, father, father)
What was I gonna say? Sorry, I don’t wanna lie
(My father, father, father)
You remind me of this old folk song that got passed around
You used to sing it
I bet the songs that you sang inside of that pub
Didn’t just pay for your dinner
Party like an animal
It was a party with the animals
[Verse 2: Tuka]
Sink a lot of liquor, kiss a lot of women
How many could you pick up?
I’m one in six
Sittin' pretty in the middle of a litter
Mum said you’re the reason I stutter
One day she got sick again, it hit her
You could have had it all
Instead, she had enough
[Chorus: alt-J]
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor soul
And, Lord, my father's one
[Verse 3: Tuka]
With me and my sister, we had to leave behind mister
My mother was a high planes drifter, she said I could ride with her
We started again as a party of three with our heart on our sleeves
She asked for redemption, in need of a friend
He was charming, I guess, but history repeats
Pardon the cliché, it was hard to believe
I can’t pretend like you, he was no father to me
Motherfucker was an animal
Wants to party with the animals
[Verse 4: Tuka]
Strum a guitar, in our house of the rising sun
You beat my mother in our madhouse of the rising sun
Drunk on Monday, was his father’s son
In the background singing, this is the song he sung
[Chorus: alt-J]
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor soul
And, Lord, my father's one
[Spoken Outro]
At one time of my life, it was in me repertoire for quite a while
Oh, for years
And then I've gotta bring the how I could do it
And do it in such a way with little finger picks
On a twelve-string guitar, strung six strings
So, I had this huge guitar, really big guitar
With a big lot of noise in it
And do "The House of the Rising Sun"
But you had to wait 'til you had enough drunks around
Can you understand that?
Like, you must have got, you wait until you've got enough drunks And you'd go, right, sing "The House of the Rising Sun"
And they'd be singing away and carrying on
And throwing money in the box
It was a good one
