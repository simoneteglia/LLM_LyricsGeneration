[Chorus]
I’m so crazy in love with you
I like all the things you do
Bloodstained sheets in Malibu
Surfboards transform into blue
[Verse 1]
Sunny days, home alone, I'm on the steps
My time goes slow, time just never ends
Welcome to hell until you're dead
My life still spins, my life never lasts

[Chorus]

I'm so crazy in love with you
I like all the things you do
Bloodstained sheets in Malibu
Surfboards transform into blue
[Verse 2]
Sunny days, home alone, I'm on the steps
My time goes slow, time just never ends
Welcome to hell until your death
My life still spins, my life never ends
[Outro]
Time just never ends
Until you’re dead
Life never ends
