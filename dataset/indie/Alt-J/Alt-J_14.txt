[Intro]
Ooh
[Verse 1: Conor Oberst,
Lianne La Havas
,
Sivu
,
Marika Hackman
, Joe Newman]
Dry dunes
cater
for jumping
boys
From the nape
of her neck
he made his descent
They watched
men
hurl
from rock
to
sea
Like sternum to
button
, lined
lip pinches
in between
[Chorus: Joe Newman,
Marika Hackman
]
Your foothills
Your warm
[Whistling Interlude]
[Verse 2: Conor Oberst,

, Joe Newman]
Iris swims
quietly
beside me
Oh, the weeds
and larger leaves
sway
And stretch themselves
beneath
Blue
dragon
flies dart
to and fro
I
tie
my life
to your
balloon
and let it go
[Chorus: Joe Newman,
Marika Hackman
]
Your foothills
Your warm
