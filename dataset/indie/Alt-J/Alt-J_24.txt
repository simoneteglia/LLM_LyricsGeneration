I'm at the door at a quarter to four
Poppers
popping, baby, might take some more
I'm fucking loose, you're gorgeous, I don't care
Come closer, baby, slap me like that snare
Moon Shaped Pool
plays in the velvet cell
Green neon sign reading "Welcome to Hell"
Leather slings fall like oxygen masks
We're going down, fuck my life in half
School of magic, with
brooms and wands
Pairs of people tugging like hungry dogs
For bone, baby,
in the house of slithering
Floor full of happy wizards scissoring
I don't subscribe to your cultural norms
My church's doctrine has lost its charm
Rise above the gloom of the jungle floor
Hit me like that snare, more, more, more
I don't subscribe to your cultural norms
My church's doctrine has lost its charm
Family matters, I couldn't agree more
This is my family fisting me on the floor
Regret my safe word, one to ten in Japanese
At the party, carpet burning my knees
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
(Ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, jyuu)
Ichi, ni, san, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, jyuu
Ichi, ni, san, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, jyuu
(Nē, sakki no sunea mitai ni aterushi, hoshī? Ji yaa sou suruwa.)
[Outro]
We are dangerous teenagers
We are dangerous teenagers
Fuck you, I'll do what I want to do
Fuck you, I'll do what I want to do
Fuck you, I'll do what I want to do
Fuck you, I'll do what I want to do
