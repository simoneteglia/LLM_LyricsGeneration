[Verse 1]
Your choice kingdom
Their voice; hear them
Our choice kingdom
[Verse 2]
Their choice kingdom
Our voice crowns men
Our choice kingdom
[Chorus]
Rule Britannia, bright ideas hide in caves
Rule Britannia, break a stock into a slave
Rule Britannia, leave us planked before the graves
Rule Britannia, ruler of the waves
