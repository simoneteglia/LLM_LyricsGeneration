[Verse]
As she submarines, the rope loops 'round her feeble feet
Before the dawn breaks on her sorry grasp
In a blink and in one motion, rope constricts, rips her towards the ocean
She never finds her bearings, sucking splash into her lungs
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Though I cannot see, I can hear
Her smile as she sings
And though I cannot see, I can hear
Her smile as she sings
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
