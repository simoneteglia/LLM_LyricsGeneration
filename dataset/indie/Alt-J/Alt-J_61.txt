[Verse 1]
At last, my baby's walked a mile
In my shoes, in my shoes
At last, at last (After so long), my baby's walked a mile (She's walked a mile)
In my shoes (Walk, walk), in my shoes (In my shoes)
[Verse 2]
At last, my baby's walked a mile
In my shoes, in my shoes
At last, my baby's walked a mile
In my shoes, in my shoes
At last, at last, at last, at last, my baby's
Walked a mile in my shoes
[Bridge]
In between waves
You hold me down
In between waves
You hold me down (Oh, save me)
In between waves (Oh, save me)
You hold me down (Oh, save me)
In between waves (Oh, save mе)
You hold me down
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna tell you, I don't wanna say
It's been so easy seeing things your way
At last, my baby's walkеd a mile
In, in my shoes
[Outro]
Say yes, say no
Say yes, don't say no
Say yes, say no
Say yes, don't say no
Say yes, say yes
Say yes, don't say no
Say yes, say no
Say yes, don't say no
