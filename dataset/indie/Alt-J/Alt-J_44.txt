[Verse 1]
"
Joe, Joe, Joe
Only fuck-ups need clean starts"
I scream as you come my way
(
I'm happier when you're gone
)
[Verse 2]
Joe, Joe, Joe
The chime of loves texting your phone
Familiar as the clothes I own
California, Pensacola, go
I'm happier when you're gone
[Verse 3]
It's not easy, it's not easy
Homelessness at home
My life is bracing for your hug
You pass me to unplug your phone
Hallelujah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The smell of burning cattle
Hangs on the westerly
Sweeping up through the fеrns
[Chorus]
I'm happier when you're gonе
I'm happier when you're gone
I'm happier when you're gone
I'm happier when you're gone
[Verse 4]
Benzo timeline
Cuts smiles to straight lines
I'm happier when you're gone (Happier)
It's not easy, it's not easy
Hopelessness on the range
(Happier)
Yeah, you're breathing hard in the pastures
If not the lock then what has to change? (Happier)
Persecution is your favourite word
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The smell of burning cattle
Hangs on the westerly
Sweeping up through the ferns
[Chorus]
I'm happier when you're gone (Happier)
I'm happier when you're gone
I'm happier when you're gone (Happier)
I'm happier when you're gone
I'm happier when you're gone
[Outro]
I'm happier when you're gone
