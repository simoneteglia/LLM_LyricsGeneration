[Verse 1]
We can't lose touch but we can let go
Blue and white gun made from Lego
All the vowels vow to hold your name
Keep your estate clean of me
I've pillowed you so many times this week
Close eyes, open, close again, forget and fall asleep
[Chorus]
The dark seeks dark
The dark seeks dark
Ooooh, darker
Ooooh, darker
[Post-Chorus]
Ooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
The nights of all my youth pressed into one glass of water
[Verse 2]
Scattered truths, bewildered beast boohoos
We have our weight: ten-thousand ladybirds
All the vowels vow to guard your name
Keep your estate clean, happy
Some things lie too deep for tears to well
Close eyes open, close again, feel as my body spells
[Chorus]
Dark seeks dark
Dark seeks dark
Ooooh, darker
Ooooh, darker
[Post-Chorus]
Ooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
The shadow burns across like embers tide paper
[Outro]
Darker, darker, darker, darker
Darker, darker, darker, darker
Darker, darker, darker, darker
Darker, darker, darker, darker
