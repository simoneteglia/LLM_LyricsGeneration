Go!
[Verse 1]
She loves you, Leon
She loves his calm moments before the storm
She's armed to her teeth, be careful, Leon
Tick-tick-tick-tick flicks a clock in the cocking of guns
But balaclavad men, they come for you and Leon
You're the only one
[Verse 2]
She loves you, Leon
She loves his calm moments before the storm
She's armed to her teeth, be careful, Leon
Tick-tick-tick-tick flicks a clock in the cocking of guns
But balaclavad men, they come for you and Leon
You're the only one
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Save her now, because she loves you, Leon
You're a pro, kill them all, kill them all 'cause you're a pro
Save her now, because she loves you, Leon
[Hook]
Oh yeah, she loves you, Leon
Well, yeah, she loves you, Leon
Oh yeah, she loves you, Leon
Oh yeah, she loves you, Leon
Yeah, she loves you, Leon, Leon
Yeah, she loves you, Leon
Yeah, she loves you, Leon, Leon
Yeah, she loves you, Leon
Yeah, she loves you, Leon, Leon

Go!

She loves you, Leon
