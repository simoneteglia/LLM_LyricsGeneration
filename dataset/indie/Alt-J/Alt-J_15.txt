[Chorus]
Something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now
[Bridge]
Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport
[Chorus]
But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now
[Verse 1]
Forty-eight thousand seats
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I'm fully clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view
[Bridge]
Get high, hit the floor before you go
Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport
[Verse 2]
Forty-eight thousand seats
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I am clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view
[Chorus]
But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now
