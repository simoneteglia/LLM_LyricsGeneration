[Chorus]
Gimme that gold
Straight into my hard drive
Gimme that gold
Straight into my hard drive, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm fifteen in my garden skipping
My neighbor Sue is watching me from her window
Oh, mama, did you tell Sue I'm a millionaire now, baby?
Trading that crypto?
(
Oh, yeah? No? Sue!
)
[Chorus]
Gimme that gold
Gimme that fire
Gimme that gold
Gimme that fire
(
Hot
)
[Verse 2]
Crying on a stranger is so very soothing
I'm outside my school
My teacher took me to one side and told me I was
scum
I left, then googled "neoliberal"
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be afraid to make, to make money, boy
Don't bе afraid to make, to make money, boy
Don't bе afraid to make, to make money, boy
Don't be afraid to make, to make money
[Chorus]
Straight into my hard drive
Gimme that gold
Straight into my hard drive, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Non-shatter ruler, put it on the table and go "brrrrrrr"
Watch it shatter
Clearly Mum's talked to Neil with the Audi
The next morning he shouts from his door
[Pre-Chorus]
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money, boy"
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money, boy"
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money, boy"
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money"
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money, boy"
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money, boy"
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money, boy"
"Don't be afraid to make, to make money"
[Chorus]
Gimme that gold
Straight into my hard drive
Gimme that gold
Straight into my hard drive, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
