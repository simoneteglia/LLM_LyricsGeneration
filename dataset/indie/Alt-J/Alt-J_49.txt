[Verse 1]
Oh, legacy is a picture of me
On holiday in the late seventies
Drying after swimming, my father calls to me (Look over your shoulder)
Sunny disposition at the end of the jetty
Now that picture is displayed
With fifteen other missing boys
[Chorus]
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
This time
[Verse 2]
Montag
You're in drag
(
Oh, es war einfach
)
Feel this birthday
Without us
(All the change in my pocket is enough to celebrate)
[Chorus]
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
This time
[Bridge]
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
And, oh, is it easy to remember
What it takes to be a man?
Oh, is it easy to remember
What it means to be a man?
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
(I will pray for us)
[Chorus]
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
This time
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
You and I
Cut from the same cloth
This time
