[Intro]
Soon
I'm gonna marry a man like no other
Light the fuse
Hallelujah, hallelujah
[Verse 1]
Love
Love is the warmest colour
Petrol blues
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Comes
Saut dans le vide, my lover
In my youth
The greatest tide washed up my prize: you
[Pre-Chorus]
Follow, let him go, let him lead me be
Love is a pharaoh,
and in front of me
I thought, let him be where he'd want to be
Love is a pharaoh and he's boning me
[Chorus]
I've discovered a man like no other man
I've discovered a man like no other man
I've discovered a man like no other man
I've found a love to love like no other can
[Post-Chorus]
I've found a love to love like no other can
He's found me, my Aslan
[Bridge]
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
Marry a man like no other
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
Love is the warmest colour
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
Unpin your butterflies, Russia
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
To be a deer in Nara
[Outro]
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama
