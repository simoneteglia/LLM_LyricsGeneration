[Verse 1]
Breathe on me, my buffalo
Your hide warms to a warning
Of a death without words
I am ill after swallowing
Cups of pride
; inside it pains me
With a bitterness I loathe
For the future tributes
to Thom Sonny Green
Breathe on me, my buffalo
Your hide warms to a warning
Of a death without words
I am ill after swallowing
Cups of pride
; inside it pains me
With a bitterness I loathe
For the future tributes
to Thom Sonny Green
[Chorus]
The buffalo from Buffalo
Who are buffaloed by the buffalo
From Buffalo, buffalo
Other buffalo from Buffalo
[Outro]
And all's above lay to pay tribute to
The future death of our Thom Sonny Green
