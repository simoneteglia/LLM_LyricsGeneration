Silent knife, unholy knife
A bridge of cracks click as I twist my spine
I turn to find a visitor
Rapture me, my Lolita
And I know she knows that I killed my love
Administer the lethal dose
(She's as white as a ghost)
The aching feels like she's gorgeous from coast to coast
The scalpel bleach, make that a smile
Stay with me, my darling, for my last little while
And she cranes to me, "I'll be there as you sing
Yet I'll be gone before the second 'kiss me'."
"Kiss me, down by the boat or the bearded barley
Nightly beside the green, green grass
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step
You wear those shoes and I'll wear that dress
Oh, kiss me."
Oh
Oh, three
Oh, fifty-three
