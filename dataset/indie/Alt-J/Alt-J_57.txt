[Verse 1]
When I passed you in the doorway
And you took me with a glance
Should've been on that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance
Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
My father's going crazy
Says you're living in a trance
[Chorus]
Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight, it's alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
[Verse 2]
Well, it's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
Disobeyed another warning
Should've been home by ten
Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
But it's a habit worth forming
If the means justify the ends
[Chorus]
I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight, it's alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight, it's alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
