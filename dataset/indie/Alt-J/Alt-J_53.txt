[Intro: Spoken]
("Okay")
("Same, sorry")
[Verse 1]
Powders in between palms
In the dry Pacific night
Ooh
Hands pulling me
To a whole new place
Ooh
[Chorus]
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
[Verse 2]
"Free house," greatest two words
To hear at sixteen
Ooh
Glee, you've arrived
Floral notes from your friends
In between the crowd, we lock eyes
[Bridge]
"
This fragrance should elevate your handsomeness
"
She's looking up from the packaging and smiling
I know this girl, I've seen her at school
"Then I'll take a pallet", I laugh
The snap of my quip is caught under another shopper
Asking for directions to the restroom
She turns back to mе
"
Would you like this gift wrapped?
"
"No, thank you"
I watch her hands
"
Okay, that'll bе $49.95
"
I think I love her
"
...Okay
"
[Chorus]
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
I'm your man, I'm your man
