[Verse 1]
Am I cold? I cannot tell
Have I fallen or am I falling down the stairwell?
(Philadelphia!)
Oh, the cadence of the glow
Concussive flashes of distant memories
Good God, I feel your hands on me
[Chorus]
In the dying of the light
My aggressor runs under the lamps
Morning light, they'll get to see
The crime committed on me
(Philadelphia!)
[Verse 2]
Sonny Green is feeling slow
Pepped up with a bag so righteous he sings all of Rubber Soul
(Philadelphia!)
Oh, the cadence of the glow
Percussive flashes over dimly lit country
Good God, I feel your hands on me
[Chorus]
In the dying of the light
My aggressor runs under the lamps
Morning light, they'll get to see
The crime committed on me
(Philadelphia!)
[Bridge]
Silk, dampened, unknown, over final thoughts
Where will I be in two years?
Euphoria breaks over the bow, washing up the macabre
Out to sea to my mother's arms
And I'm losing my ability to fathom
Awake and not awake
And I'm losing my ability to fathom
Awake and not awake
And I'm losing my ability to fathom
Awake and not awake
[Outro]
(Philadelphia!)
