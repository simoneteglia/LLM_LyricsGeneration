[Verse 1]
Hallelujah, I'm listening to
A recording of you sleeping next to me
A cappella, I'm listening to you cover
Elliot Smith's "Angeles"
It's these times I'll need if you go
It's these times I'll need if you go, so
[Chorus]
Get better, my darling
I know you will
Get better, my darling
I know you will get better
[Verse 2]
I'm drawn to the motorway
The cold whoosh of trucks passing
This nighttime under sodium light
The orange spread is soul-quietening
[Refrain]
A younger you and a younger me meeting at The Serpentine
I am yours, you are mine
[Verse 3]
Happy birthday,
staff smuggled in a card I made
It rests under your pillow
When out of ICU
, you'll cringe at all the "I love you"s
The card retired the life of one biro
At this time, I wanted you to know
At this time, I wanted you to know
[Chorus]
Get better, my darling
I hope you will
Get better, my darling
I hope you will get better
[Verse 4]
I'll start the day with tiramisu
Raise a spoon to frontline workers
An underfunded principle
They risk all to be there for us
[Refrain]
A younger you and a younger me meeting at The Serpentine
I am yours, you are mine
[Verse 5]
You were the baker,
I'll christen this new era
With the smell of freshly baked bread
Your Nutella, I'll keep it in the cellar
You were always a fan of that spread
Six months on, there's a car crash outside
The fire brigade using the jaws of life
No flush at night to sound your return
I still pretend you're only out of sight
Front garden bouquet, I threw it at the fire brigade
I was admonished and told to go back inside
From the living room window,
I stand and watch the white sheet go
Over the family car and I close my eyes
[Chorus]
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone
I still pretend you're only out of sight in another room
Smiling at your phone, I still pretend
[Verse 6]
A younger me, a younger you
Meeting at The Serpentine
The beginning of spring, you wore those yellow ripped jeans
Your look defined my 2009
Your shyness stoked my boldness
"Shall we go in?" I smiled
Your hand warmed walking through the gallery
[Outro]
Get better
I know I will
Get better
My darling, I know I will
