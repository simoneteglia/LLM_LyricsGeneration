[Chorus: Lil Peep]
She said she love me now but back then (Back then)
She ain't love me, she just lookin' for rent (Lookin' for rent)
She pick me up in a Black Benz (Black benz)
Schemaboys, this ain't never gonna end
[Verse 1: JGRXXN]
Damn, JGRXXN turn to the max
Now I want his ass on a track
Is it cool?
See your shit blowin' up and you know I fucks wit' you, huh?
Even though I never hit your phone and never returned your texts
Don't give a fuck about that, see that shit on the rise
And I want a piece of that pie, yuh
Hold up ho, slow your roll
Stay your distance, fall out back
Who is you? You's a foo
If you think that's gonna work
Triple six, ain't no blunts
On Indica, in the cut
Better control your ho 'cause she see us blowin' up
[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I could remember when no one had nothin' to say to me
Now they all up on my dick
Scheme with the clique, when I look I see no competition
Lil Peep, I am up in this bitch
Poppin' whatever come at me, I'm off of the crappy
Look at me, I'm slashin' my wrist
I'll put 'em back in they place
Nobody loved me, but now they relate
All of the sudden, they act like I'm great
Act like my cousin, gon' eat off my plate
What, 'cause I'm buzzin', you finna get paid or somethin'?
Nah, you buggin', I came from nothin'
Don't come around when I'm up and I'm comin'
Bitch, you wasn't there, I got hoes on my stomach
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, no, I don't love 'em
Bitches, they love me, but no, I don't cuff 'em
I bought the rubbers for all of my brothers
All of your troubles, get double with hunnids
Tripled with time, triple six bumpin', I'm sippin' on wine
If you ain't fuckin' then get to the side
If you are lucky enough to survive
Keep this in mind, bitch, you ain't nothin'
[Chorus: Lil Peep]
She said she love me now but back then (Back then)
She ain't love me, she just lookin' for rent (Lookin' for rent)
She pick me up in a Black Benz (Black benz)
Suck my dick like she ain't want this shit to end (Want this shit to end)
She said she love me now but back then (Back then)
She ain't love me, she just lookin' for rent (Lookin' for rent)
She pick me up in a Black Benz (Black benz)
Schemaboys, this ain't never gonna end
[Outro: Lil Peep]
She say she, she say she
Back then, back then
