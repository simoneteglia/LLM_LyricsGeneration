Ain't shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son (whistle)
Pick a petal, eenie meeny miny mo
And flower, you're the chosen one (whistle)
[Verse 2]
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz, girl, you're the one for me (whistle)
Though your man's bigger than I am
And oh my days, he disagrees
Oh no (whistle)
Eenie meeny miny

Miny miny meeny
Meeny miny meeny
Meeny miny meeny
Meeny meeny meeny
Miny meeny meeny
Miny mo and flower, you're the chosen one
[Chorus]
Well your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Gun, gun, gun, gun
Gun, gun, gun, gun
Oh no
(Instrumental)
