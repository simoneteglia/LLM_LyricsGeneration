[Intro: Spoken]
Cold and sizzling
[Verse 1]
I sold my soul
I sold my soul
For a sip at school
For a sip at school
A swimming pool
A swimming pool
Ice cold black fuel
Ice cold black fuel
[Verse 2]
I'll dive in
Swimming and drinking
And when my parents tell me to come in
I'll just ignore them and keep on drinking
Cola, cola
Fizzy cola
[Refrain]
Yeah, you
In the middle of the night, I get a craving and I wake up for you
[Verse 3]
Thirsty one looks stunned
Dumbfounded by the sizzle of the bubbles on the tongue
Sixty-six times underwater somersault
Pool cool, cooling by the side of the swimming pool
The rules don't apply to you 'cause you've got the buzz
Sixty-six times underwater somеrsault
[Verse 4]
Thirsty one looks stunned
Dumbfounded by thе sizzle of the bubbles on the tongue
Sixty-six times underwater somersault
Cut the queue, climb the scaffold to ride the flume first
Slap a bigger boy so hard he wakes up on the floor
Sixty-six times underwater somersault
[Refrain]
Yeah, you
In the middle of the night, I get a craving and I wake up for you
[Bridge]
My God, my God
Why hast thou forsaken me?
My God, my God
Why hast thou forsaken me?
[Outro]
Yeah, you
In the middle of the night, I get a craving and I wake up for you
