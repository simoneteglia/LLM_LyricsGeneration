[Refrain: Joe Newman]
Hit me like that snare more, more, more
Hit me like that snare more, more, more
Hit me like that snare more, more, more
Hit me like that snare more, more, more
[Chorus: Jimi Charles Moody]
Focus
Take time, stop motion (More, more, more)
Invite no jokers twice in vain (More, more, more)
Broken
Love bruised and hopeless (More, more, more)
Feel like I know you, won't compare (More, more, more)
[Verse 1: Joe Newman]
I'm at the door at a quarter to four (focus)
Poppers popping, baby, might take some more (focus)
I'm fucking loose, you're gorgeous, I don't care (focus)
Come closer, baby, slap me like that snare
[Bridge: Jimi Charles Moody]
Like a dog, like a dog, like a dog
Let me follow, let me follow what you got
On the vinyl, another drama, another taste (like that snare)
[Refrain: Jimi Charles Moody & Joe Newman]
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
[Chorus: Jimi Charles Moody]
Focus
Take time, stop motion
Invite no jokers twice in vain
Broken
Love bruised and hopeless
Feel like I know you, won't compare
[Verse 2: Joe Newman]
Regret my safe word, one to ten in Japanese (focus)
At the party, carpet burning my knees (focus)
Na na na na na na na na na na na na (focus)
[Bridge: Jimi Charles Moody]
Something treacherous, but I still want to fail
Fool-fool-beautiful, you try to conceal
Your lies, your lives, you told me open wide
[Refrain: Jimi Charles Moody & Joe Newman]
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
Focus (hit me like that snare more, more, more)
Focus
Focus
Focus
Focus
