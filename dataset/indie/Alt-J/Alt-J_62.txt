[Intro: Joe Newman]
Ooh, my Adeline
Ooh, down in Tasmania
[Verse 1: HEX]
Oh, yeah
Mask on your face, masquerade, ball
Show what’s beneath, see the smoke, when you leave
Blown away, dandelion, oooh
It‘s a mystery, heart broke, feel fatigued
Adeline, stepping out of line
Wish you wel,l for the season, like it’s slime
Tears won’t fall, even when I cry
Almost fucking took a bullet for my valentine
[Chorus: Joe Newman]
I watch your morning swim again
Ooh, Kodachrome blue sky
Strokes from patch to warm patch
My sweet Adeline
Ooh, I wish you well
[Verse 2: Paigey Cakey]
On a wave, on a wave
On a one, on a grey
You can land a highway or get small in my lace
See my face on the magazines
Said you hate me, you’re a fan of me
Antisocial on the socials, only time I speak is when I see my family
Looping Louie you know I’m cray (cray)
Bet you hate what I became (came)
I’ve been snoozing on the plane (plane)
[?] to a lane
I’m saucing, yeah
Why you calling, that’s a line you’re crossing, yeah
I wish you well
[Chorus 2: Joe Newman]
And the old triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the Royal Canal
My Adeline was swimming; sweet Adeline was singing
To the tune of the Royal Canal
I wish her well (My Adeline)
I wish her well I wish her well (My Adeline)
I wish her well I wish her well
I wish her well
