[Verse 1]
Now dissolve me
Two tabs on your tongue
A herd of shepherds to herd the sheep
Sleep now, my only one
Broken sweethearts, ah
Who sleep apart
Both still pine for the other's side spine
Spoon as sleep starts
[Pre-Chorus]
And pulse to pulse
Now, shush
[Chorus]
She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
To calm me down
[Verse 2]
I am see-through
Soap sliver, you're so thin
As I begin rubbing lathers out
Your state worsens on my skin
And gold
Fatless finger to lip
One-two, three-four, hush
[Pre-Chorus]
And pulse to pulse
Now, shush
[Chorus]
She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
To calm me down
She makes the sound, the sound the sea makes
I'm tired now
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
[Outro]
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north
She makes the sound the sea makes
Knee-deep in the north sea
