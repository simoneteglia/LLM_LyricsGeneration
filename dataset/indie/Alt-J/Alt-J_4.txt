[Verse 1]
Ain't shady, baby, I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe, and flower
You're the chosen one
[Chorus]
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh-oh-oh, no
[Verse 2]
I tackle, we tussle , and oh my days
We're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his Colt
Single-action army
Oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh-oh-oh, no
[Verse 3]
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz, girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh my days, he disagrees
Oh-oh-oh, no
(Speak easy)
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh, no
[Verse 4]
Ain't shady, baby, I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe, and flower
You're the chosen one
[Chorus]
Well, your left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Well, my left hand's free (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh, no
