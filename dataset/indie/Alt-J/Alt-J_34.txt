[Intro]
On the night line
(On the night line)
[Verse 1]
When I wake up in the morning light
Sunlight hurts my eyes
Something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
Then I look at you
[Chorus]
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Oh, just one look at you
Just one look at you
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
For the night line
For the night line
[Verse 2]
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
[Chorus]
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Oh, just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
On the night line
For the night line
[Outro]
On the night line
On the night line
On the night line
