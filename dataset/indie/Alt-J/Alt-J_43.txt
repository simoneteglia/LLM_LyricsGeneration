[Intro]
(
Yeah
)
[Verse 1]
Bricked up a kilo
Panelled down in the back door
All the while I'm riding
To auditions I'm not getting
[Refrain]
Why do I keep on returning to you?
[Verse 2]
All-American jawlines
One room going over same lines
Grind the script
Like teeth
[Refrain]
Why do I keep on returning to you?
Cocaine, cocaine
[Verse 3]
Swarm of TV cameras
Click and stumble at the
Château
Later, I hear John's
Body got carried out
"Ice cream"
was a code word
Told to me by a cold man
These nice hotels
Gotta know your clientele
[Refrain]
Why do I keep on returning to you?
Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocainе
Why do I keep on returning to you?
(Give me somе ice cream)
(Give it to me now, I want it now)
[Chorus]
I'm in the deepest end of an empty pool
(He's never gonna make it)
(He's never gonna make it in L.A.)
I'm in the deepest end of an empty pool
Cocaine, cocaine
I'm in the deepest end of an empty pool
(He's never gonna make it)
(He's never gonna make it in L.A.)
I'm in the deepest end of an empty pool
(He's never gonna make it)
Cocaine
(He's never gonna make it)
Cocaine
