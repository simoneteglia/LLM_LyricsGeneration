[Verse 1]
I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
(Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm)
Turn you inside out and lick you like a crisp packet
[Break]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2: Joe Newman &
Gus Unger-Hamilton
]
You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole)
I want to be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woollen jumper
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Be your Minpin
And Borrower of handsome trivia
(Hey!)
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Devour me
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Lou, Lou, let the cover girls sing
(Hey!)
[Break]
Do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do
[Verse 3: Joe Newman &
Gus Unger-Hamilton
]
All hand claps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room)
I want to be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes, I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw dusted patios
(Ooh)
I'm gonna kiss you
Like the sun browns you
(Hey!)
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Devour me
(Hey!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey! Hey!)
Devour me
(Hey-hey!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey-hey! Hey!)
If you really think that you can stomach me
(Hey-hey!)
[Outro]
(Hey! Hey! Hey-hey!)
I want every other freckle
(Hey!)
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
(Hey-hey!)
I want every other freckle
(Hey!)
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle, freckle
(Hey-hey!)
