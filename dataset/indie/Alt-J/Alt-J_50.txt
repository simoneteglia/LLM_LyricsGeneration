[Verse 1]
Oh Sally, my dear
It's you I'd be kissing
She smiled and replied, "You don't know what you're missing."
[Verse 2]
If all the young men
Were hares on the mountain
How many young girls would take guns and go hunting?
[Verse 3]
If all the young men
Were fish in the water
How many young girls would undress and dive after?
[Verse 4]
If the young men could sing
Like blackbirds and thrushes
How many young girls would go beating the bushes?
[Verse 5]
But the young men are given
To frisking and fooling
So, I'll leave them alone and attend to my schooling
