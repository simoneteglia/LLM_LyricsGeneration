[Verse]
She-she-she-she only ev-ev-ver-ver-ver-ver
Walks to-to count-count her steps
Eighteen-teen strides and she stops to abide
By the law that she herself has set
That eighteen steps is one complete set
And before the next nine right and nine left
She looks up-up at the blue
And whispers to all of the above:
"Don't let me drown, don't breathe alone
No kicks, no pangs, no broken bones
Never let me sink, always feel at home
No sticks, no shanks, and no stones
Never leave it too late, always enjoy the taste
Of the great-great-great grey world of hearts"
As all dogs everywhere bark-bark-bark-bark
"It's worth knowing
Like all good fruit, the balance of life
Is in the ripe and ruin"
