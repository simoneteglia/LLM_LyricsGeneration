Deathwish, deathwish
I think that boy want his deathwish
Deathwish, deathwish
Deathwish, deathwish
I think that boy want his-
[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Living like I got a deathwish (I got a deathwish)
Blood on my necklace (Blood on my necklace)
Show me respect, bitch (Show me respect, bitch)
Gimme your neck, bitch (Gimme your neck, bitch)
She on my checklist (She on my checklist)
Order my next bitch (Order my next bitch)
Fuckin' my ex-bitch (Fucking my ex-bitch)
I'm feeling reckless (I'm feeling reckless)
Give me a problem I'ma put that inside of my bottle when I drink it up
Schema with the posse, you fuckin' with legends, you playing yourself if you don't give it up
Stashing my dope in the back of the bus
Go get the money then give out the cus
Kamikaze if you run up on us
Keep the bodies in the trunk
Ayy, uh
[Verse 2: JGRXXN]
Damn, I am who I am and that's the wrong Sneaker God
Yo well being, I will pull apart the flesh
Put that on me, I bring carnage
Bloodstains on the windowpane and your garments
Nigga, back, back, hear the clap, clap
Take that nap, nap, hear the crack, crack
When I swing the bat, you must want your deathwish
You can catch the iss', see these hands blister
Watch your hips twist, just like that bitch

Deathwish, 'cause that boy ran up on me
You know that we the hardest in this industry
That boy want his deathwish
Open up your eyes and see
I'm not your friend, boy, I'm the enemy
I think that boy want his
deathwish
Deathwish, deathwish
Deathwish, deathwish
I think that boy want his deathwish
Deathwish, deathwish
Deathwish, deathwish
I think that boy want his-
