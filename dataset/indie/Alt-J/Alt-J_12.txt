[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Heat shimmers
Hips quiver
Open smother
Lipped lover
[Chorus]
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Razor blades on a melted toothbrush
Assassin de la police
[Verse 2]
Heat shimmers
Silky glistener
Open smother
Lipped lover
[Chorus]
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Silent knife, unholy knife
Iâ€™ve fallen for the black outside my window
On the C-O-double-M-O-N
On the C-O-double-M-O-N
[Refrain]
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
Quelea, quelea
And I won't admit I loved you
And that I will lie for you
And I've waited, waited for you
Here, wait in front of you
Oh my body lays down [?]
My eyes will close for you
And the world will tremble, too
Keep waiting for you
