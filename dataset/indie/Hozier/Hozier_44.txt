[Verse 1]
A joy hard learned in winter was the warming of the bed
You'd shake for minutes there and move your legs
Wrap the blanket over you and keep your head within
Let your breath heat the air until you’d feel it getting thin
[Chorus]
Uiscefhuaraithe
The feel of coldness only water brings
There are some things that no one teaches you, love
That come natural as a
dream you didn't know that you were in
[Post-Chorus]
And darlin', all my dreamin’ is only put to shame
And darlin', all my dreamin' has only been given a name
But it came easy, darlin'
As natural as another leg around you in the bed frame
[Verse 2]
In summer's heat, I learned to dread the comin' of the night
The awful things we do to make the head go quiet
You'd press your body to the concrete when you were small
The rains of winter seemed to never leave the walls
[Chorus]
Uiscefhuaraithe
The feel of coolness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That God in his awful wisdom first programs in
[Post-Chorus]
But darlin', all my dreamin’ is only been put to shame
And darlin’, all my dreamin' has only been given a name
But it happened easy, darlin’
As natural as another leg around you in the bed
[Bridge]
And I wish I could say
That the river of my arms have found the ocean
I wish I could say the cold lake water
of my heart
Christ, it's boilin' over
[Outro]
But it happened easy, darlin'
Natural as another leg around you in the bed frame
