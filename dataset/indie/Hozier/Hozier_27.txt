[Verse 1]
Do you think I'd give up?
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink?
How could you think, darlin', I'd scare so easily?
Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane?
[Pre-Chorus]
If someone asked me at the end
[Chorus]
I'd tell them, "Put me back in it" (Da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')
I'd go through it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
[Post-Chorus]
I would still be surprised I could find you, darlin', in any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Da-ah, darlin', I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
[Verse 2]
For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease, ours nеver knew peacе
What good would it be on the far side of things?
It was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip takin' hold like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes
[Pre-Chorus]
Though I know my heart would break
[Chorus]
I'd tell them, "Put me back in it" (Da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')
I'd go through it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
[Post-Chorus]
I would still be surprised I could find you, darlin', in any life
If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
[Outro]
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
