[Verse 1]
Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud, creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life
[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms, I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to
[Chorus]
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you
[Refrain]
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
There are questions I can't ask
Now, at last, the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh, someday
Our baby and her momma and the damaged love she made
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't know what else that I would do
Than to try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms, I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to
[Chorus]
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you
[Refrain]
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Feels good, girl, it feels good
Feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you
