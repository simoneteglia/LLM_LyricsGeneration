[Verse]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The tide that sticks around
Like somethin' in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
You've no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly
Every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spillin' drinks on my settee
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know if this feelin' goes both ways?
It's sad to see you go, sorta hopin' that you'd stay
Darlin', we both know that the nights are mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when you've had a few?
'Causе I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours to fall for somebody nеw
Now, I've thought it through
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know if this feelin' goes both ways?
It's sad to see you go, sorta hopin' that you'd stay
Darlin', we both know that the nights are mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Oh, crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when you've had a few? (Goes both ways)
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too (Sorta hopin' that you'd stay)
Busy bein' yours to fall for somebody new (Goes both ways)
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you (Sorta hopin' that you'd stay)
Ever thought of callin' when you've had a few? (Goes both ways)
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too (Sorta hopin' that you'd stay)
Busy bein' yours to fall for somebody new (Goes both ways)
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you (Sorta hopin' that you'd stay)
Ever thought of callin' when you've had a few? (Goes both ways)
'Cause I always do
