[Verse 1]
Just a little rush, babe, to feel dizzy
To derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe, my veins are busy
But my heart's in atrophy
[Pre-Chorus]
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
[Chorus]
You and I, nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Some whiff of this, death and guts, we are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
[Verse 2]
Somethin' isn't right, babe, I keep catchin'
Little words, but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe, I keep scratchin'
But, somehow, I can't get in
[Pre-Chorus]
So we're slaves to any semblance of touch
Lord, we should quit, but we love it too much
[Chorus]
Sedated, we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Some whiff of this, death and guts, we are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
[Bridge]
Darlin', don't you stand there watching
Won't you come and save me from it?
Darlin', don't you join in
You're supposed to drag me away from it
[Pre-Chorus]
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
[Chorus]
You and I, nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Some whiff this, death and guts, we are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Sedated, we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Some whiff of this, death and guts, we are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
