Lyrics From
Snippet
…Made right
By the hope that She affords me
As She’s lifting spring towards me
Like a baby in her hands
Back on ground
The thought arriving with her;
No mere saint makes shit of winter
Here or any land
And of all times, I won’t lie
If she can pull it off just one more year
I swear, the old demotion be damned
I will not rob the goddess
I will not rob the goddess
One more prayer
