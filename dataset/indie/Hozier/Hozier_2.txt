[Verse 1]
Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire
[Pre-Chorus]
It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me
[Chorus]
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine
The blood is rare and as sweet as cherry wine
[Verse 2]
Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother
[Pre-Chorus]
But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time
[Chorus]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine
The blood is rare and as sweet as cherry wine
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Her fight and fury's fiery
Oh, but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time
[Chorus]
The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist, oh, would be fine
The blood is rare and as sweet as cherry wine
