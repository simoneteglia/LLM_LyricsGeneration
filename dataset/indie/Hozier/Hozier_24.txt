[Verse 1]
I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around (Hey, yeah)
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness in Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me
[Chorus]
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
[Verse 2]
I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)
That's found in the last witness
Before the wave hits, marvelling at God (Hey, yeah)
Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me
[Chorus]
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
