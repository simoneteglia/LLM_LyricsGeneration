[Verse 1]
My head was warm, my skin was soaked
I called your name till the fever broke
When I awoke, the moon still hung
The night, so black that the darkness hums
I raised myself, my legs were weak
I prayed my mind be good to me
An awful noise filled the air
I heard a scream in the woods somewhere
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
A woman's voice, I quickly ran
Into the trees with empty hands
A fox, it was, he shook afraid
I spoke no words, no sound he made
His bone exposed, his hind was lame
I raised a stone to end his pain
What caused the wound? How large, the teeth?
I sure knew eyes were watchin' me
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 3]
The creature lunged, I turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have
Dear, in the chase, there as I flew
Forgot all prayers of joining you
I clutched my life and wished it kept
My dearest love, I'm not done yet
How many years? I know I'll bear
I found something in the woods somewhere
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
