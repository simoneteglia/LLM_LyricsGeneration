[Verse 1: Maren Morris,
Maren Morris & Hozier
]
In the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah,
life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it
[Chorus: Maren Morris,
Maren Morris & Hozier
]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good, mmmm
[Verse 2: Hozier, ,
Maren Morris & Hozier
]
Call it dumb luck, darling, you and I
Can't even mess it up, though we both tried
No, it won't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing
[Chorus: Maren Morris & Hozier,
Maren Morris
]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good
(Mmm)
[Bridge: Maren Morris & Hozier]
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter
Paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter
[Chorus: Maren Morris, with Hozier]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain
’Cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
[Outro: Maren Morris]
Ooh
Na na na no no no
