Come guess me this riddle, what beats pipe and fiddle
What's hotter than mustard and milder than cream
What best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal
Sweeter than honey and stronger than steam
What can make the dumb talk, what can make the lame walk
What's the elixir of life and philosopher's stone
And what helped Mr. Brunnell to dig the Thames Tunnel
Sure wasn't it whiskey from old
Inis Eoghain
So we'll stick to the
cratur
the best thing in nature
For sinkin' your sorrows and raisin' your joys
And boys I half wondеr if lighting and thunder
Was made from the plundеr of whiskey me boys
