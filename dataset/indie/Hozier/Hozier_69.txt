[Verse 1]
Yes, I do, I believe
One day that I will be
Where I was, right there
Right next to you
And it's hard
These days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars
Are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story
[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh, but the feeling is much too strong
[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight
[Post-Chorus]
Mm
[Verse 2]
Reaching out to you
Oh, can you hear my call?
Oh, this hurt that I've been through
Well, I'm missing you like crazy, like crazy, like crazy
[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh, but the feeling is much too strong
[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight
[Bridge]
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me down tonight
[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't wanna be here if I
can't be with you
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, next to you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight
