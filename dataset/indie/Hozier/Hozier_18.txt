[Verse 1]
All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here too
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
[Verse 2]
All
the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns that all words in the fight fell to
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby
[Verse 3]
And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you'll have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's wasteland, baby
[Bridge]
When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Are the end, but the start of all things that are left to do
[Chorus]
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
[Outro]
That's it
