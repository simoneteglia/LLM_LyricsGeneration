[Verse 1]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Verse 2]
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Verse 3]
It’s not the talking it’s the doing
It’s the hand that yearns for work, in its renewing
Of the self each time you try
Of purpose and of pride
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising
[Verse 4]
It's not the song, it is the singing
It is the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the baring of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Chorus:]
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, oh
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, oh
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power
[Verse 5]
It’s not what’s in front but who’s beside you
It’s all that came before and what it provides you
All those that held the line
Who wouldn’t bow down and
resign
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising
[Verse 6]
It's not the wall but what's behind it
The fear of fellow men, his mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising
[Chorus]
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Joni cried power
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
James Brown cried power
Lennon cried power
Nina cried power
[Bridge]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free
I could cry power (power)
Power is my love when my love reaches to me
A perfect show of love
Any act of hope and love
In its actuality
[Chorus]
I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Curtis cried power
(Dylan) Cried power
Marvin cried power
Cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Power
Power
Nina cried power
