[Intro]
If the wind turns, if I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
[Verse 1]
I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the border line of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now that I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden offered to us by the world
[Pre-Chorus]
And though I burn, how could I fall
When I am lifted by every word you say to me?
[Chorus]
If anything could fall at all, it's the world
That falls away from me
[Verse 2]
You have me floatin' like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I wondered what was holdin' up the ground
But I can see that all along, love, it was you all the way down
[Pre-Chorus]
Leave it now, I am sky-bound
If you need to, darlin', lean your weight to me
[Chorus]
We'll float away, but if we fall
I only pray, don't fall away from me
[Bridge]
I do not have wings, love, I never will
Soarin' over a world you are carryin'
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion
If the wind turns, if I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
[Chorus]
If I should fall on that day
I only pray, don't fall away from me
