[Verse 1]
Picture a man
Seen like a speck out from the shore
Swimming out beyond the breakers
Like he's done his life before
He feels a coming of a squall
Will drag him out a greater length
But knows his strength and tries to gather it
[Verse 2]
And he swims on
Turning back to shore again
Above the outer atmosphere
Of a world he's never seen
And looking down to his new home
He feels the rising of a wave and knows at once
He will not weather it
[Pre-Chorus]
Like that man
I lookеd down into the depths when I mеt you
I couldn't measure it
[Chorus]
Anytime I'd struggled on
Against the course out on my own
Every time I'd burn through the world, I'd see
That the world, it burns through me
But when I (When I), I'd let go (I'd let go)
My struggling form (My struggling form), my willing soul (I'd see)
Every time (Each time I) would flow through the world, I'd see (Flow through the)
That the world (The world), it flows through me (It flows through me)
That the world, it flows through me
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Picture a grave
Picture six feet freshly dug
The sharp temporary walls
At the long-term cliff edge of the world
Light and air find some new deepness there
And usher down the sky
Where one stands by and tries make sense of it
[Verse 4]
But try measure loss
Measure the silence of a house
The unheard footsteps at the doorway
The unemployment of the mouth
The waking up, having forgotten
And remembering again the full extent
Of what forever is
[Pre-Chorus]
With each grave
I think of loss and I can only think of you
And I couldn't measure it
[Chorus]
Anytime I've struggled on (When I struggled on)
Against the course (Against the course) out on my own (I'd see)
Every time (Each time I) I'd burn through the world, I'd see (Burn through the)
That the world (The world), it burns through me (It burns through me)
But when I (When I), I'd let go (I'd let go)
My struggling form (My struggling form), my willing soul (I'd see)
Every time (Each time I) would flow through the world, I'd see (Flow through the)
That the world (The world), it flows through me (It flows through me)
That the world, it flows through me
