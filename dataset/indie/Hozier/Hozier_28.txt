[Verse 1]
There is a roadway, muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd have life enough, my heart is screamin' of
And in a few days I will be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me is yours, just as it was
[Chorus]
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the flame
[Post-Chorus]
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
[Verse 2]
Tell me if, somehow, some of it remains
How long you would wait for me and how long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now, your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me or just tell me 'bout your day
[Chorus]
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the shame
[Post-Chorus]
The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
And half as beautiful too
