[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
[Verse 1]
Baby, even though I hate ya, I really love you
I want you
Even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
I want you
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can’t you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I got to have it
I want you
[Pre-Chorus]
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realise that I’ve got
[Chorus]
One less problem without you (Oh, oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh)
[Verse 2]
And I know you'll never gonna wake up, I got to give up
But it's you
Even though I shouldn't call back or let you come back
But it's you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
But it's you
[Pre-Chorus]
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realise that I've got
[Chorus]
Got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less, one less problem
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less, one less problem
[Verse 3]
If you know like I know
You don’t wanna step to this
It’s the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you're high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate
[Chorus]
Got one less problem without you (Oh, oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less problem without you (Oh)
I got one less, one less problem
[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
