[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
[Verse 1]
One bright mornin' changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathin', you wake
Your eyes open at first, a thousand miles away
But turnin' shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believin' in
Could this be how every day begins?
[Pre-Chorus]
The sky set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts, you fillin' my cup
The sun comin' up
[Chorus]
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Bеfore the first light
(Some bright mornin')
[Verse 2]
Onе bright mornin' goes so easy
Darkness always finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to callin' out your name
But after this, I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again
[Pre-Chorus]
The sky set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts, you fillin' my cup
The sun comin' up
[Chorus]
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes), yeah
Yeah, like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes), yeah, yeah
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
