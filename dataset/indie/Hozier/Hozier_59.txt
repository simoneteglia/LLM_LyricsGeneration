[Verse 1: Noah Kahan]
Breathin' in, breathin' out
How you been? You settled down?
You feelin' right? You feelin' proud?
How are your kids? Where are they now?
[Pre-Chorus: Noah Kahan]
You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your friends, you lose your wife
You settle in to routine
Where are you? What does it mean?
[Chorus: Noah Kahan]
If I get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't rise
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light
[Post-Chorus: Hozier]
Mm
[Verse 2: Hozier]
You bought some shit, you search online
You're gettin' lost, you're gettin' high
All alone late in life
Scared to live, scared to die
[Pre-Chorus: Hozier,
Noah Kahan
]
You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your kids, you lose your wife
You settle down, you're feelin' lost
You're gettin' stoned, then kickin' rocks (
Three, four
)
(Hey)
(Ooh)
[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Hozier]
If I get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't rise
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light
[Post-Chorus: Noah Kahan & Hozier,
Hozier
,
Noah Kahan
]
Oh, ah (
Oh
)
Oh, ah (
Hey-hey-hey
)
Oh, ah (
Oh
)
Oh, ah (
Oh
)
[Chorus: Noah Kahan & Hozier]
If you get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't shine
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light
[Outro: Noah Kahan]
Sick
