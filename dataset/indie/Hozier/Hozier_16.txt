[Verse 1]
You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire,
I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me
[Verse 2]
Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags, they washed out in the mind of mе
Where a blindin' light shone on you еvery night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me
[Chorus]
It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la)
It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la)
You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la)
Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknown
So much of the livin', love, is the being unknown
[Verse 3]
You called me "angel" for the first time, my heart leapt from me
You smile now,
I can see its pieces still stuck in your teeth
And what's left of it, I listen to it tick
Every tedious beat
Going unknown as any angel to me
[Bridge]
Do you know I could break beneath the weight
Of the goodness, love, I still carry for you?
That I'd walk so far just to take
The injury of finally knowin' you?
[Chorus]
It ain't the being alone (Sha-la-la)
It ain't the empty home, baby (Sha-la-la)
You know I'm good on my own (Sha-la-la)
Sha-la-la, baby, you know, it's more the being unknown
And there are some people, love, who are better unknown
