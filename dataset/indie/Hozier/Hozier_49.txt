[Verse 1]
Come here to me,
I wish I was a may fly
on the River Tay
I'd fit all my joys and my pleasures in one perfect day
I wish I was the sunlight just sitting on The Mississippi
I'd settle for a shopping trolley in
The Liffey
In a shot, I'd swap my body for a body of water
Worry the cliff side top as a wave crashing over
I'd lower the world in a flood or, better yet, I'd cause a drought
If I was a riptide, I wouldn't take you out
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be anything
But I would do everything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do everything if you'd hear me say
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah, hey
Go look anothеr way
Yeah, hey
Look another way
[Verse 2]
Look, I wanna bе loud, so loud, I'm talking seismic
I wanna be soft as a single stone in a rainstick
I wanna be the thunder of a hundred thousand hooves moving quick
If I was a stampede, you wouldn't get a kick
I wanna be the shadow when my bright future's behind me
I wanna be the last thing anybody ever sees
I hear he touches your hand and then you fly away together
If I had his job, you would live forever
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be anything, love
But I would do everything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do everything if you hear me say
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah, hey
Go look another way
Yeah, hey
Look another way
[Bridge]
I don't wanna be anything, be anything
But I would do everything (Go look another way)
I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Don't wanna be anything, anything
[Outro]
Oh, yeah, hey
Go look another way (I don't wanna be anything)
Yeah, hey
Look another way
