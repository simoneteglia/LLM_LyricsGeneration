[Verse 1]
True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dapple long ago
[Verse 2]
True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire, but that was long ago
[Chorus]
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
Light a fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
[Verse 3]
With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
[Verse 4]
With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago
[Chorus]
That's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh)
Light the fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
[Verse 5]
So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the "would that I'd loved" is long ago
[Chorus]
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
Light the fire bright (Oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh)
Oh, you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, you're good to me, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
