[Verse 1]
At last, when all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God, at the start, couldn't bear
[Verse 2]
And sit unseen with only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowin' yourself
With all mirrorin' gone from the world
[Verse 3]
But, still, the mind, rejectin' this new empty space
Fills it with somethin' or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done
[Outro]
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Trína chéile
Le chéile, claochlaithe
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Is claochlú an ealaín
Is ealaín dubh í
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíchе
Trína chéile
Le chéile, claochlaithе
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Is claochlú an ealaín
Is ealaín dubh í
