Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I done
Alas it was to none but me
For all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And of all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But as it falls unto my lot
That I must go and you must not
I gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
