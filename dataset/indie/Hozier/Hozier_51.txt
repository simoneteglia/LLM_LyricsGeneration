[Verse 1]
I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still
Of every chill
Chided by the silence of the hushed sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine
Staring into blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are
Unknown we are
To the world and to the both of us
I confessed a longing I was dreaming of
Some better love
[Chorus]
But there's no better you love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love
[Verse 2]
I have never loved a darker blue
Then the darkness I have known in you
Honed from you
You whose heart would sing in anarchy
You who'd laugh at meanings guarantees
So beautifully
When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory
Witness me
Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
Or live eternally
[Chorus]
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love
[Bridge]
Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
[Chorus]
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me
There's no better love
That ever has loved me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me
There's no better love
That justifies me
There's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Feel better love
