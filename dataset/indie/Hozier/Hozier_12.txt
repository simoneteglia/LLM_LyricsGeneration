[Verse 1]
When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on
Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
[Chorus]
When the meaning's gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
[Verse 2]
What yields the need for those who lead us oh-so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
[Chorus]
Since it all begun
To its reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me
[Chorus]
Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me
So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me
