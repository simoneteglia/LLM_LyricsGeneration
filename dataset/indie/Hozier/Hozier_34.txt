[Verse 1]
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps
[Chorus]
Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to it
Honey, don't feed it, it will come back
[Verse 2]
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that
[Pre-Chorus]
I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need
[Chorus]
Don't let me in with with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to me
Honey, don't feed me, I will come back
[Bridge]
It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh, please, give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't afford
I warn you, babe, each night, as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door
[Outro]
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
