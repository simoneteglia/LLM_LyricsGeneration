[Verse 1]
You know when it's twelve o'clock in Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I wake up, I don't know
And I think about you though, everywhere I go
And I've done everythin' and I've been everywhere, you know
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been fed gold by sweet fools in Abu Dhabi
And I've danced real slow with Rockettes on dodgy molly
[Chorus]
But I've had no love like your love, ooh, from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love
[Verse 2]
Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise
The excitement of a thousand, or the soothing of your voice
[Pre-Chorus]
At first chance, I'd take the bed warmed by the body, woo
I once warmed my hands over a burnin' Maserati, woo
[Chorus]
Still, I've had no love like your love from nobody
I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love
[Outro]
And on the other side, why should we deny the truth?
We could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do, I've had no love like your love
