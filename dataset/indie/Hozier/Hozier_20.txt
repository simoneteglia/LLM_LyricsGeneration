[Verse 1]
For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words a cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name to the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothing and, honey, if nothing's gained?
[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
[Chorus]
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
[Verse 2]
Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me 'cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire, hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me and if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble, marvel at flowers you'll have made
[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
[Chorus]
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
But I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't hope to know, but here I stand
[Chorus]
And there's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
But I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the reign
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
