[Verse 1]
Tryin' hard to recognise
Some pure motive inside of me
A creature that would horrify
Any child that I used to be
Oh, give no faith to show
Started to smile so I showed my teeth
No more than flesh and bone
Doin' so much just to watch someone bleed
[Chorus]
But I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
[Verse 2]
Tryin' hard, I nearly find
Innocence in spite of me
Oh, creature that would terrify
Any child left inside of me
Oh, that's a cold insight
Nothin' above us and nothin' below
Ahh, but you might be right
If there is no heaven and there is no soul
[Chorus]
I just love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Always, always, always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Oh,
I love the very blood of you
Leaks and squeeks you black and blue
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
