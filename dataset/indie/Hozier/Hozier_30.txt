[Verse 1]
A husband waits outside
A crying child pushes a child into the night
She was told he would come this time
Without leaving so much as a feather behind
To enact, at last, the perfect plan
One more sweet boy to be butchered by men
[Chorus]
But the gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to man
The swan upon Leda
Empire upon Jerusalem
[Verse 2]
A grandmother smuggling meds
Past where the god-child soldier, SÃ©tanta, stood dead
Our graceful turner of heads
Weaves through the checkpoints like a needle and thread
Someone's frightened boy waves her on
She offers a mother's smile and soon, she's gone
[Chorus]
The gateway to the world
The gun in a trembling hand
Where nature unmakes the boundary
The pillar of myth still stands
The swan upon Leda
Occupier upon ancient land
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro]
The gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men
