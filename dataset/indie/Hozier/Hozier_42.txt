[Verse 1: Hozier,
Hozier & Brandi Carlile
]
Without shame, two outfits then to my name
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go and every desire for goin' there
I heard once,
it's the
comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor and wake up feelin' like a millionaire
[Pre-Chorus: Hozier & Brandi Carlile]
Wish I'd known it was just our turn (We just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (But we tried)
You and I had nothin' to show (We didn't know)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands (Anythin', darlin')
[Chorus: Hozier & Brandi Carlile]
And darlin', I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feelin' ended
But I know bein' reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
[Verse 2: Hozier,
Brandi Carlile
,
Hozier & Brandi Carlile
]
One time we would want for nothin' (
One time
,
we had it all
, love)
We knew what our love was worth
(
When we had nothin'
)
Now we're always missin' somethin'
(I miss when)
I miss when
we did not need much
[Verse 3: Brandi Carlile,
Hozier & Brandi Carlile
]
Oh, if the car ran, the car was enough
If the sun shone on us, it's a plus
And the tank
was always filled up
Only enough for our gettin' there
[Pre-Chorus: Hozier & Brandi Carlile,
Brandi Carlile
]
That first car was like wings on an angel (
You flew away
)l
Before the whole wide world got too thin (
From me then
)
I swear goodwill kept up the engine
You were steerin' my heart like a wheel in your hands (
Turn back, darling
)
[Chorus: Hozier & Brandi Carlile]
And darlin', I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feelin' ended
But I know bein' reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
[Instrumental]
[Bridge: Hozier]
Why did we never run
Before our chance was gone?
Why did we never run
Before our chance was gone?
[Outro: Hozier & Brandi Carlile]
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
