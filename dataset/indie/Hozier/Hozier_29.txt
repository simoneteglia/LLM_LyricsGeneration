[Verse 1]
I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight?
But whose heart would not take flight
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight?
[Chorus]
I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
[Verse 2]
All the tales the same
Told before and told again
A soul that’s born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
And, at last, can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
[Chorus]
All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight
Oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight, sunlight
[Bridge]
All these colours fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colours fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
[Verse 3]
Each day, you'd rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad happily
With wax melted, I’d meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
[Chorus]
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, but it is sunlight
[Outro]
Sunlight, sunlight
Sunlight, sunlight
Sunlight
