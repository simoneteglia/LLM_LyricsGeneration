[Verse 1]
Honey, this club here is stuck up
Dinner and diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eyes
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talkin' type
I’d suffer hell if you'd tell me
What you'd do to me tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me, ah
[Chorus]
That’s the kind of love
I've been dreamin' of
That's the kind of love
I've been dreamin' of
[Verse 2]
Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar I am, upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinkin'
What you'd do to me tonight
Now that the evenin’ is slowin’
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it’s easier knowin'
What you'd do to me tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell your man, ah
[Chorus]
That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreamin' of
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
I've been dreamin' of
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
[Bridge]
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be hotel complaints
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
And grievances raised and that kind of love
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be damage ensued
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
And tabloid news and that kind of love, mm
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
I've been dreamin' of, ah
Oh, ah
[Chorus]
And that's the kind of love
I've been dreamin' of
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
And that's the kind of love
I've been dreamin' of
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
(That's the kind of love, that's the kind of love)
