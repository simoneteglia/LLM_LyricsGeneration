[Verse 1]
You've done me wrong
For a long, long time
But after all you've done
I never changed my mind
[Chorus]
Honey, please, try to love me
Honey, please, honey, try
My love will never die
[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
[Verse 2]
Flowers, flowers grow
Where I'm laid to rest
Honey, pick a blossom
And hold it, hold it to your breast
[Chorus]
Honey, you know that's my love
Burstin' loud from inside
My love, oh, my love
My love will never die
