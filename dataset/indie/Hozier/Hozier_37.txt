[Verse 1]
When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singin'
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin’ shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came
[Pre-Chorus]
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
(Lover, be good to me)
[Chorus]
Be as you've always been (Lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered the sin (Lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost
(Lover, be good to me)
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (Lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
Oh, lover, be good to me
[Verse 2]
When the man who gives the order
Is born next time 'round on the boat sent back
When the bodies starvin' at the border
Are on TV givin' people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there's nothin' left for you and I to do
Oh, when there’s nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love, for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover, be good to me)
[Chorus]
Ah, be love in its disrepute (Lover, be good to me)
That scorches the hillside and salts every root (Lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowin’ and starvin' of troops
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (Lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (Lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
Oh, lover, be good to me
[Outro]
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you’ve always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you've always been?
