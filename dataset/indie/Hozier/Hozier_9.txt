[Verse 1]
I'm starvin', darlin'
Let me put my lips to somethin'
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carvin', darlin'
I wanna smell the dinner cookin'
I wanna feel the edges start to burn
[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the gettin' is gone
I won't lie if there's somethin' to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come
[Chorus]
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Puttin' food on the table, sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to you
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal
[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I'm makin' sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie if there's somethin' still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come
[Chorus]
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Puttin' food on the table sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young
[Instrumental Outro]
