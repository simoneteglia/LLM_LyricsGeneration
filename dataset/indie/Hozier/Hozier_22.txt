[Verse 1: Hozier]
I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow
[Pre-Chorus: Both,
Karen Cowley
,
Hozier
]
We lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to
thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, t
wo corpses I sa
w
[Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
[Verse 2: Karen Cowley]
I have never known sleep
Like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colour
Like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold
[Pre-Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier,
Karen Cowley
,
Hozier
]
We lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land
and worry the sheep
[Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
They'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
[Bridge:
Karen Cowley
,
Hozier
]
They'd find us in a week
(
We lay here for years or for hours
)
When the weather gets hot
(
So long we'd become the flowers
)
They'd find us in a week
(
We lay here for years or for hours
)
When the cattle show fear
(
So long we'd become the flowers
)
[Chorus: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
[Outro: Karen Cowley & Hozier]
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
