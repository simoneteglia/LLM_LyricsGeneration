[Verse 1]
If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If it ain't so awful and we're all together, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think I couldn't roll with you, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If ideally we should feel like this forever, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
[Chorus]
(And she said) Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
(And she said) Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one
[Verse 2]
If you think I couldn't hold my own, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to tell you that you're special, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you need someone to carry on, believe me, I can
Believe me, I can, believe me, I can
If you think no one is feeling what you're feeling, I am
Believe me, I am, believe me, I am
[Bridge]
And the groove is low
[Chorus]
(And she said) Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this (And the groove is low)
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one
[Refrain]
Telemona
Telemona
, oh
And the groove is low
Telemona
And the groove is low
[Chorus]
Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone (Telemona)
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun (Telemona)
Do this and get through this
And until we see the sun (And the groove is low)
You're my number one
[Refrain]
Telemona
(And she said)
And the groove is low
Telemona
And the groove is low
[Outro]
We're both adults while we behave like children
Long as we got enough to keep on living
Telemona
Telemona
