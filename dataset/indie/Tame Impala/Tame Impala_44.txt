[Intro]
It's like, "Oh, bass," cool
You know how you make the bass better?
Crank the bass up (
Yeah
)
You know how to make the kick drums better?
Just crank the bass up
And then it's like, "No, not really"
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
Might just find it after all
[Outro]
