[Intro]
Now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
Now I gotta add yours to my list of faces to try and not think about
[Verse 1]
Now I gotta tell 'em I don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
It was obviously an illusion 'cause there's never been so much I've been wrong about
And I don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one I can't live without
So I'm gonna have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about
[Pre-Chorus]
To try and for-
[Chorus]
And as the years go by youur name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry, but it was waiting in-
[Verse 2]
So now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
It could've been magic, nearly had ya, can you imagine? Nearly had ya
'Til it becomes another one of the things that I just can't talk about
I'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about
[Pre-Chorus]
Try and for-
[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
And as the years go by your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart went dry, but it was waiting in the wings
And as the years go by you'll stay a banished memory
They'll say my love has died, but it was waiting in the wings
