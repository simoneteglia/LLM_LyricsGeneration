[Verse 1]
Lazy bones and no concern
Sees forty one mosquitoes flying in formation
I'm alright, but my pet cockroach died of starvation
Sleep 'till late, I won't mind if we do nothing today
Come and stay, bring your friends
Who needs floor space anyway?
So do you not want me to come over?
So do you not want me to come over?
[Chorus]
Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
[Verse 2]
The other side of the land, they like my brain
They don't waste time and they don't wait
And do what they want
As long as I don't have to concentrate
Broken drums, thriving dreams
Not much else between these walls
One more spliff, I am already gone but duty calls
So do you not want me to come over?
So do you not want me to come over?
[Chorus]
Not much we know, so off we go
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
Ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh, ahhh-ahhh
