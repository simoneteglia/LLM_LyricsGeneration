[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead
