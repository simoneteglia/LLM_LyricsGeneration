[Verse]
I was trying to resolve in a way
That felt natural
Oh, I was hoping it would come outright
Who was I kidding
[Pre-Chorus]
Push the button and start counting down
Oh, time is crawling to the moment
Beyond which
[Chorus 1]
I can choose
I can fall
I can lose, control
I concur
With the doubt
But I can’t
Turn back round
And they dread
What’s beyond
But time
Is rolling on
Rolling on
[Bridge]
Now let’s do this right
Everybody
(And I’ll be trying)
It wouldn't come out right
[Chorus 2]
I can fold
I can lose, control
I can lose, control
I can face, the unknown
Yes, I must
Venture there
If I fail
I don’t care
[Outro]
(Now let’s do this right)
There’s so much
Left unclear
But it’s time
Taxi’s here
