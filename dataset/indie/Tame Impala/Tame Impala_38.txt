[Verse 1]
Said the voice from afar
"Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
Waiting for everyone else around to agree
Might take too long
Might take too long"
[Pre-Chorus]
"When, it won't be so hard" (It won't be so hard)
Well, it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
[Chorus]
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego
[Verse 2]
Get them to love you, while they may
Depending on your words and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else
Nobody else
[Bridge]
If I could part
[Pre-Chorus]
It wouldn't be so hard (It won't be so hard)
Well, it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me
[Chorus]
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego
