[Verse]
Has it really been that long?
Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?
[Pre-Chorus]
They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
"So what you doin' with your life?"
It ain't givin' up
[Chorus]
Just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my days are shapeless
[Post-Chorus]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone
[Bridge]
I'm just laying here
Waiting for a change to come
Take us to the place
Takin' us where we would have gone
[Pre-Chorus]
They would ask me all the time
Showin' up in ages
"So what you doin' with your life?"
Call it givin' up
[Chorus]
I'm just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my ways are aimless, I know
We're growin' up in stages
And I'm runnin' out of patience
Growin' up
[Outro]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone
