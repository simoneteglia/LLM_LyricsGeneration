[Verse 1]
We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?
[Chorus]
She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care

We'll see
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
See how we go
Until we know what the future holds
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
