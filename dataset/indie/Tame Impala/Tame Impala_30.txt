[Chorus]
I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami, go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
[Verse 1]
This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
Quite alright, quite alright, sittin' here
Yes, reminiscent, I think this is different
I know this is different (I'm about to)
Let's
cause something permanent
Just so we know we can
[Chorus]
I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you say, "And here comes forever"?
Oh, here forever, let go of me with open arms
[Verse 2]
We'll be lovers until the end of time (I'm about to)
I see it now
I see just how you're so right (I'm about to)
You're so clear now
[Chorus]
I'm about to do something crazy, no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami, go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
[Outro]
Let's drink this magic potion
Of love and devotion
And then let's see how it goes
