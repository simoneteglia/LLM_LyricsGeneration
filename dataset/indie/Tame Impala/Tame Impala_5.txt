[Verse 1]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
[Chorus]
We're on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiven
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
[Verse 2]
Here I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away
[Chorus]
We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train
[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
(Comes the sun)
[Verse 3]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
Rudi said it's fine
They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable)
[Chorus]
And we're on the borderline (Ooh)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
(Comes the sun)
