[Verse 1]
Save your fragile mama's heart
And while she will come for you
But I wander
[Chorus]
And I wonder just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't even know her
[Verse 2]
Feel just like I need to be
Back where I was before
I couldn't go back
But I wander
[Chorus]
And I wonder just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't even know
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Bridge]
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (How)
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (How)
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be
For shaking tough so easily
For hours on end, I wander
(Ooh)
[Outro]
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me (And I wonder)
How it keeps a lid on me (Just how far will you need to be)
How it keeps a lid on me (For shaking tough so easily)
How it keeps a lid on me (For hours on end I wonder)
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
[Studio banter:]
Jay: What were you saying?
Kevin:
(Laughing)
That was like, the worst cymbal ever
Jay: What's upâ€”Well, I don't understand what you're trying to tell me
Kevin: Sounds like... human hair
Jay:
(Laughing)
You could have waited!
(Jay plays loud drum fill)
Kevin: What, Gumby?
Jay: I said, I'm sick of you taking over
Kevin: Oh, aw
Jay: I want to record the drums on all our albums, alright?
Kevin:
(Laughing)
Jay: Modular? Hear that?
