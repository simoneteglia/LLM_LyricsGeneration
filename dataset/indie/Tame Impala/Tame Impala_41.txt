[Pre-Chorus]
You got a body built for the beach
Do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep
Body surf on me, woman
Do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep
Until I hit the peak
You got a body built for the beach
Do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep
Body surf on me, woman
Do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep
Until I hit the peak, oh
Until I hit the peak, oh

Wanna ride that wave
Wanna ride that wave

Don't stop, wanna ride that wave
