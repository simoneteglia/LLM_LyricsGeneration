[Verse 1]
The sun rose on the wrong side of the Earth this morning
Nobody noticed but you
So you winked at the sun
And the sun winked back, and you kept it to yourself
Alright
[Verse 2]
The stars are gonna give up hope this evening
Nobody knows this but you
When the small ones have imploded
And red giants have supernova'd
Then sorry the Earth will be
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
The sun rose on the wrong side of the Earth
