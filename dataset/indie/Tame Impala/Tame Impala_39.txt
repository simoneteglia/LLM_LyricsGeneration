[Verse]
But that's only when I think of you (Think of you, think of you)
Some vision that I hold on to (Hold on to, hold on to)
You know it's everything I do (Thing I do, thing I do)
You know it's everything I do (Thing I do)
Can almost stand competing with the others
Can almost hear the fun that I should be having
Instead of all this dreaming
But it's only when I think of you (Think of you, think of you)
The mover I could turn into (Turn into, turn into)
There must be something I can do (I can do, I can do)
Yeah, there must be something I can do
[Chorus]
I just don't know how to feel right
A beautiful girl is wasting my life
I'm playing a part as somebody else
While tryin' so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
This will all make sense one day
I guess I'm alright, but they're all doing so well
What I would give to be under that spell
[Post-Chorus]
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon (Yeah)
You'll know soon (Yeah)
You'll know soon (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Bridge]
But you don't know the truth
I'm in love with you
You just don't believe
In anything I do
[Chorus]
In so many ways I'm somebody else
While tryin' so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
This will all make sense one day
Well it's getting late, I'd better go
I made it this far as far as I know
[Outro]
In so many ways I'm somebody else
While tryin' so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
This will all make...
