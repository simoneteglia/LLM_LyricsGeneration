[Verse]
Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizons bear nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim
Has slowly become all we do
[Chorus]
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
And now I fear we might
Ooh, now I fear we might
[Post-Chorus]
But it's okay
I think there's a way
Why don't we just say, "One more year"? (One more year)
Not worryin' if I get the right amount of sleep (One more year)
Not carin' if we do the same thing every week (One more year)
Of livin' like I'm only livin' for me (One more year)
Of never talkin' about where we're gonna be (One more year)
One more year
Of livin' like the free spirit I wanna be
[Bridge]
We got a whole year (One more year)
Fifty-two weeks
Seven days each
(One more year) Four seasons, one reason, one way
One year (One more year), one year
One year, from today
From today
[Outro]
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
Now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
For all time
One more year
