[Verse 1]
I stand in the distance
I view from afar
Should I offer some assistance?
Should it matter who you are?
[Chorus]
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
[Hook]
Confide in me
Confide in me
[Verse 2]
I can keep a secret
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children free
[Chorus]
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
[Hook]
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
[Bridge]
Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours
Stick or twist, the choice is yours
Hit or miss, what's mine is yours
[Chorus]
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
[Hook]
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
Confide in me
