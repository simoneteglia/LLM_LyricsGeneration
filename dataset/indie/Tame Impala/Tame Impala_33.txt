[Chorus]
Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you I don't know
Maybe I'm just reading into it a little deeper than I should
We would make it easy, we would take it slowly, if only we could
[Spoken Interlude]
Hey, what are you doing out here? You're thinking about everything, aren't you? I know itâ€™s crazy, just don't think of it like that. Nothing has to mean anything. Come on, come back inside
[Verse]
Elodie, look at me, unless you're tryin' to hurt me
Heavy blow, down I go, now I just want to let go
Is it right? Is it wrong? I don't know
It's not the cause I'm fightin' for anymore, but it sucks to keep on runnin'
Eventually, there will be a time for clearer thinking
For now, I weep, can't get to sleep
,
I try to hold a good feeling
I just get one, here it comes, there it goes
Now we just might lose the fight, yeah, but it's alright, it wasn't our decision
[Chorus]
Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you that I know
Every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
I'll just be here waiting 'til the doctor calls and then I'll let you know
