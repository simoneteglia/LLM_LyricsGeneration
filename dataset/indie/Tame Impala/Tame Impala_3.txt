[Verse 1]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"
[Chorus]
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning
[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen
[Chorus]
All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my take-off fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Refrain]
I cuh-nuh duh-wuh, you wuh-nuh scri-wih
Try-guh-duh do-wee, try to pun-stoo-wee
You wuh-nuh thinkin' that I wuh-luh do-wee
They be lovin' someone and I wuh-nuh stuh-wee
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do-wee, eh you wuh tun-tun na
I cuh-nuh duh-wuh, you wuh-nuh scri-wih
Try-guh-duh do-wee, try to pun-stoo-wee
You wuh-nuh thinkin' that I wuh-luh do-wee
They be lovin' someone and I wuh-nuh stuh-wee
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do-wee, eh you wuh tun-tun
[Bass Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
I cuh-nuh duh-wuh, you wuh-nuh scri-wih
Try-guh-duh do-wee, try to pun-stoo-wee
You wuh-nuh thinkin' that I wuh-nuh do-wee
They be lovin' someone and I wuh-luh stuh-wee
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do-wee, eh you wuh tun-tun na
[Outro]
Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, baby, now I'm ready, moving on
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
Oh, baby
