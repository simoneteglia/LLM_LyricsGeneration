[Verse 1]
Just a moment
Right before all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
But there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not long until (All that I have)
And everything's still (One more hour)
Minutes are racing, whatever I've done
I did it for love (All that I have)
I did it for fun (One more hour)
Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for houses, not for her
Not for my future children
Until now
[Verse 2]
How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) How could I love again?
(Move on) How can I walk this path for sure?
(Lose her) With no more time to spare
(Move on) I know the answer more and more
[Chorus]
As long as I can, long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can, long as I can
Be the man I am
[Bridge]
Ooh, life is strange
For one more hour
I can rage
For one more hour
[Chorus]
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Remember who I am
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (How could I love again?), as long as I can
Be the man I am
[Outro]
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
One more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go from here
All those people said we wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with you and I could roll into another year
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
One more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go from here
All those people said we wouldn't last a minute near
I'm with you and I could roll into another year
Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
