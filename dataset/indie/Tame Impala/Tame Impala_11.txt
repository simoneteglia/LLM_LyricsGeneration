[Verse 1]
When we were livin' in squalor, wasn't it Heaven?
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones
[Pre-Chorus]
So if they call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase them
[Chorus]
'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
[Verse 2]
Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said, "Oh, what I'd give to start over, boy, I'd command it
So, what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry"
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if they call you, embrace them
If they stall you, erase them
[Chorus]
'Cause it might've been somethin', who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to get lost in yesterday
[Refrain]
If it calls you, embrace it
If it haunts you, face it
[Bridge]
I know it's mad, I understand
It's only Snakes and Ladders
The myriad you never had
There's only one that matters
[Outro]
And if it calls you, embrace it
If it holds you, erase it
Replace it
