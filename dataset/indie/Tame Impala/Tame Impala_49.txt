[Verse 1]
Please don't get answers from eyes
You know that mine can't lie quite as well as yours
Just let the spare moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through the open doors
[Verse 2]
Please don't deflate from a sigh
I'd hold still every time but I'd start to shake
I wander around for days
Wondering what I'll say when they want the truth
[Chorus]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
Oh...
[Solo]
[Chorus]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
[Chorus]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
[Chorus]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
[Chorus]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
Oh...
