[Verse 1]
Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Saying, "It's so obvious"
But really, they don't know (They don't know)
Just like a monster that is (Man or machine)
Only a shadow (A shadow)
From which I'm already runnin'
[Verse 2]
Easy, I suppose
And even if it takes
A hundred-thousand goes
The way's in front of me 'cause
That's the one I chose (I chose)
It's always starin' at you (Barely a choice)
That's the boat I row (I row)
And though it seems to be
[Chorus]
Endless problems
Relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run till I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward, I go
[Verse 3]
Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Saying, "It's so obvious"
But really, they don't know (They don't know)
Just like the monster that is (Man or machine)
Only a shadow (A shadow)
But you're already runnin'
[Chorus]
Endless problems
Relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run till I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward, I go
