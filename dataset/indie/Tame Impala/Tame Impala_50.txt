[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
And if you're telling me that I've got so much to lose
All the talking about it, it's all noise
[Refrain]
Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are wе living for?
[Verse]
Let it out
I can see it now
Tryin' to hold it down
I hear it now
[Bridge]
All the constants in your futurе bore you
Kinda makes your mind up for you
Knowing just what lies before you
Leaves you no surprise
[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy
[Guitar Solo]
[Refrain]
Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?
