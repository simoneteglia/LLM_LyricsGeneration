[Verse 1]
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go
Oh, dare I face the real world?
[Chorus]
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out
Won't have to check my watch
[Verse 2]
I, I don't have the verve to belong to this dead side
Woah woah, why I ever tried, I, I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world?
[Chorus]
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I forget
Try to let desire be, desire go
[Bridge]
Feel, feel it come, feel it come
I...
[Verse 3]
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long It's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go
