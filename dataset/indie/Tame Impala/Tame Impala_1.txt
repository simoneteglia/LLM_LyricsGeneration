[Verse 1]
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better
[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
[Verse 2]
She said, "It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
[Outro]
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Givin' in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
All sweet talkin', where he wants ya
So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line
So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line
So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line
