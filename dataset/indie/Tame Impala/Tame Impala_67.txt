[Intro]
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up the sunshine
Turn up the sunshine, turn up, turn up, turn up the sunshine
[Verse 1: Diana Ross]
We can make it further, we runnin' and don't look back
It's a light at the end of the tunnel if you stay on track
But I know any minute, when your fingers turn it up like snap
So hard to lose like that, hey
[Chorus: Diana Ross]
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine
We gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it, all the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine
You gotta turn up the sunshine
Said, it's been a long night, long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine
We gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that
[Verse 2: Diana Ross]
You want, you got it, I'm with it if you do it like that
It's brighter now when the colors of the rainbow flash
We gotta keep it movin', make a change so it don't change back
So hard to lose like that
[Chorus: Diana Ross]
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine
We gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it, all the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine
You gotta turn up the sunshine
Said, it's been a long night, long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine
We gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that
[Bridge: Diana Ross & Kevin Parker]
If this weather makes you frown
And some people get you down
Remember, love's like sound
It's better when it's loud
And if there's no sun in sight
We can bring the light together
Day or night
We're shining from inside
[Interlude: Diana Ross]
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the—, turn it up
Turn up the sunshine
[Chorus: Diana Ross]
(Let's do it) All around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine
We gotta turn up the sunshine
Think about it, all the boys and girls
You gotta turn up the sunshine
You gotta turn up the sunshine
Said, it's been a long night, long night
Waiting for the light, waiting for the light
Let's do it all around the world
We gotta turn up the sunshine
We gotta turn it up
Make it hard to lose like that
