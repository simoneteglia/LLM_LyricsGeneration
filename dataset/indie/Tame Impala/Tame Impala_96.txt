[Chorus: Jay Watson]
It's the retina show for your eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
It's the retina show for your eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
[Refrain: Kevin Parker]
If you don't think it then it won't show
And you believe it too
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
[Break: Kevin Parker]
Make me, make me feel love
Make mе, make me feel love
Makе me, make me feel love
Make me, make me feel love
[Chorus: Jay Watson]
It's the retina show for your eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
[Refrain: Kevin Parker]
If you don't think it then it won't show
And you believe it too
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
[Chorus: Jay Watson]
It's the retina show for your eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
It's the retina show for your eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
