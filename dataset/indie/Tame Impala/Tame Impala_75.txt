[Verse 1]
When I get up I've dreamt too long
Everything else is half as strong
I could see though, outside my head
They got it right, I got it wrong
[Chorus]
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
[Verse 2]
Shook off her optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I've planned
Who is the one who can't let go?
I will miss out, hell, don't I know
[Chorus]
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
(All the love I could bring her)
[Chorus]
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the songs I could sing her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
