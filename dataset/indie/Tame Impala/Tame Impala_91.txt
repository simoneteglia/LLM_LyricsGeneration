[Verse 1]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"
[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen
(It's gonna feel so good)
[Instrumental Break]
(It's gonna feel so good)
[Verse 3]
It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"
(It's gonna feel so good)
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Tryna get through it, Tryna get through it
Try to bounce to it
You were not thinkin' that I will not do it
Why would I do it?
They be lovin' someone and I’m not that stupid
Take the next ticket to—
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it?
And you wanna think that—
And you wanna—
[Instrumental Break]
(It's gonna feel so good)
(It's gonna feel so good)
(I will be holding on)
[Outro]
Let it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, let it happen
All this running around, trying to cover my shadow
An ocean growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning
(It's gonna feel so good)
Let it happen, let it happen
Just pet it happen, let it happen
(It's gonna feel so good)
