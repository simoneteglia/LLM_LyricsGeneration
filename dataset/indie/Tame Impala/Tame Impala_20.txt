[Verse 1]
'Cause I was nervous, sure
But it's something I'm used to
And I could tell by your face
No one's ever been rude to you
When I could tell you things
That I can't say to anyone
And you came home today
But you didn't stay very long
[Chorus]
Now it's like the world owes you
Walking around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried whose audience will lose you
[Verse 2]
And I had no idea
What that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you've changed
By the people around you
I used to take the long way
Just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside
But I guess I won't anymore
[Outro]
There's so much I wanna tell you
So long, I wanna be there
