[Verse 1]
Shifting, shifting, shifting aloud
Like it makes so much difference to me
Huffing, puffing, marching around
Like I know how much better it should be
I know it looks like I disagree, nine-tenths of the time
[Chorus]
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
[Verse 2]
Childhood puppy is old and gruff
Your mother wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed
Three weeks ago today
[Chorus]
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
[Chorus]
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind...
