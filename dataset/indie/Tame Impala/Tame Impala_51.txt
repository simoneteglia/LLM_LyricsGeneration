[Intro: Thundercat]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 1: Thundercat]
I'm sorry, girl, didn't mean to drag you in my dreams
Baby, no more lies
Feelin' free, that's the way it's s'posed to be
For you and me
You and I both know it's harder than it seems
Love is a two-way street
I'm lettin' go because the both of us don't need to drive
Baby, it's one at a time
[Break: Thundercat]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2: Thundercat]
That's just the way it works or you and I keep getting hurt
We're gonna lose control of the wheel
So put your seatbelt on, I think we're about to crash
In a world of pain
There's so much work to do
So much to unpack
But it's not your fault
I'm just kind of ass
[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Parker]
It's lookin' like I won't be home for another year
Long left undone
'Cause I might just drift on out of here
On the run
[Chorus: Kevin Parker &
Thundercat
]
I'll just be on my own, I'll just be homе alone
My troubles are my own
Unlеss she wants to come back
I'll just be on my own (
Yeah
), I'm dancin' on my own
I'll just stay on my own (
Unless she wants to
)
Unless she wants to come back
[Post-Chorus: Thundercat]
Yeah
Yeah
[Bridge: Thundercat]
As you go out in the world
Don't look back to move forward, there's no time in our lives
As you know
There's something wrong in your mind (In your mind)
If you think there's no pain in my heart to say goodbye
Please don't cry, I'm letting go
[Chorus: Kevin Parker &
Thundercat
]
I'll just be on my own, I'll just stay home alone
My troubles are my own
Unless she wants to come back
I'll just be on my own (
Yeah
), I'm dancin' on my own
I'll just stay on my own (
Unless she wants to
)
(
I mean, my longest relationship was like, seven years
)
Unless she wants to come back
[Outro: Thundercat]
And she, she was fine (Yeah)
But I need to know what I'm doin' between one to two years with you (Yeah)
And either way it goes
My therapist told me that I should tell you the truth
And you're, but you're still angry, so sometimes I still like I still should've lied
I tell you the truth because I care, but I also lie to you because I care
But if I tell you the truth, I guess I can sleep better at night?
But then it looks like I don't care because I'm telling you the truth
I mean, I, I guess I'm just not a f—
Everybody hates when they get to that part when they realize that
I don't wanna tell you I don't care, but if it seems like I don't care
It doesn't mean I don't care, it just looks like I don't care
Because my emotions have been sanded off
I live in L.A., sweetie, what do you expect?
