[Verse 1]
I could never see your eyes
And I can't see past the lies
Which is why
I still long for us
And in the meantime
Here comes the chorus
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
I know you like your own kind
And that pulls me out of line
Which is why
I can drop anchor for a long time
When I am drunk
And I feel fine
Yeah, I feel fine
[Instrumental Outro]
