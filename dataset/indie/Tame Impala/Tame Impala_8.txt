[Verse 1]
If only there could be another way to do this
'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well, this is the very very last time I'm ever going to, ah
[Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Verse 2]
Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life, you wouldn't have to change it, ah
[Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
I said, I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
And I know just what I've got to do and it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier and I know you will too
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Eventually, ooh-ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Eventually, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Eventually
(Eventually)
