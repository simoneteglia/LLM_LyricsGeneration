I hope that you are the one
If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do things I know you like
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
Today, today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like catch a matinee
Baby, you are the prototype
I think I'm...
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again
Let's go, let's go to the movies
(And... action!)
I think I'm in love again...
Girl, right now I wanna say, I wanna say
I wanna say stank you (stank you) very much (very much)
For picking me up
And bringing me back to this world
I can't or not, I can't afford to not record
I think I wanna say
I think I wanna say stank you
Stank you smelly much
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world
Stank you very much...
Hey, hey John
Are we recording our ad libs?
Really, what we were recording just there?
Let me hear that that first one
