[Chorus]
All I give are little clues
Maybe, one day, I'll get through
But there is nothing I can do
I'll just keep on lying to you
I only need to say it's true
Your poor little heart already knew
But there is nothing you can do
I'll just keep on lying to you
[Verse]
Should my cover ever blow
Would you ever let it go?
There is something you should know
But hell if I'd ever let it show
So here I am, trying to be strong
It was noon, now my shadow's long
I guess I'll go and tell you just as soon
As I get to the end of this song
To the end of this song
To the end of this song
To the end of this song
To the end of this song
[Bridge]
The curse has won again
Soon I'll be alone
Take all you can
Please understand
That it never really was love
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through
There is nothing you could do
I'll just keep on lying to you
