[Verse 1]
In the end, it's stronger than I know how to be
And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want my footsteps to be silent anymore
[Refrain]
Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closing
[Verse 2]
In the end, it's coming, there's nothing left to do
But I'm still not certain, just how I'm gonna feel
[Refrain]
I'll only know in the moment (Ooh)
Anticipation growing (Ooh)
[Chorus]
It's getting closer
Ooh, it's getting closer
It's getting closer (I'm not ready)
Ooh, it's getting closer (I need a little more time)
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
It's getting closer (Closer, every day, don't cry, we'll be okay)
Ooh, it's getting closer (Closer, wall of the dam, hold on and breathe if you can)
It's getting closer (Closer; I'm not ready)
Ooh, it's getting closer (Closer; breathe if you can; I need a little more time)
It's getting closer (Closer; I'm not ready)
It's getting closer (Closer; I need a little more time)
[Outro]
It's getting closer
Ooh, it's getting closer
