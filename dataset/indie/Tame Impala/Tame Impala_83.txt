[Verse 1]
That's all for everyone
That's all for me
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
I care for everyone
I cry for more
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
That's all
[Chorus]
I need somewhere to go
That's all
Must be what I need
That's all
I need someone to know
That's all
Exactly what I need
[Verse 2]
I can't stay
I can't deceive
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
So that's all for everyone
That's all for me
That's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
That's all
[Chorus]
I need somewhere to go
That's all
Must be what I need
That's all
I need someone to know
That's all
Exactly what I need
[Verse 3]
So that's all for everyone
Must be just exactly what I need
That's all
[Chorus]
I need somewhere to go
That's all
Must be what I need
That's all
I need someone to know
That's all
Exactly what I need
[Outro]
That's all
That's all
That's all
