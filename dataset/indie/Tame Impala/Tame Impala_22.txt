[Verse 1]
I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, I'm walking over
[Pre-Chorus]
What will I do?
I never had a chance to
[Chorus]
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
[Verse 2]
Tryna be patient but I'm feeling ancient
Tryna control the way that I'm facing
[Pre-Chorus]
Suppose that I didn't care anymore
Fate can decide, I can ignore
I'll just pretend that I always knew
That I had the chance to
[Chorus]
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Making such a promise
Only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
Tryna stay in motion
[Bridge]
It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
[Pre-Chorus]
It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
[Chorus]
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decision are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I can sense you doubt me
You don't need to promise
That only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
All there's left to do
[Outro]
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's leftâ€”
