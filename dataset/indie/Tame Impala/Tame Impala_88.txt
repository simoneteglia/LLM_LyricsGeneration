Send me back, the feeling's reached the core
Ocean waves sound more like whispers from the shore
See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before
There is no
There's nothing that I need to say
See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before
Once before
See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before
See my eyes look back again once before
(Once before)
See my eyes look back again once before
Feeling's in the core
Feeling's in the
Feeling's in the core
