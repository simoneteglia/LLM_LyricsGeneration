[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
[Verse 2]
Thank God that I've been blessed with a patient mind
Cause' what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
You don't know how hard it can be
