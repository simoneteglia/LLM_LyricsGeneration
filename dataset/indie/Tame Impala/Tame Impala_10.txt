[Part I]
[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes
[Verse 2]
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself
[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave
[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?
Did you hope I'd never doubt?
Never one day work it out?
[Part II]
[Verse 3]
You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
If there was time to recover
One-on-one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another
Everything that I have
Wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own
[Refrain]
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words, sing along
[Verse 4]
(This time) Wanna tell you 'bout the time
(I know) I was in Abbey Road
Or the time that I had
Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when we spoke
[Refrain]
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice sing along
[Verse 5]
(This time) I wanna say, "It's all right"
(I know) You're just a man after all
And I know you had demons
I got some of my own
I think you passed them along
[Refrain]
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along
