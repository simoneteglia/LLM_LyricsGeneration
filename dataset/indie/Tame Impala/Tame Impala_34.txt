[Verse 1]
Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about it and less about you
No one else around to look at me so
I can look at my shadow as much as I please
[Pre-Chorus]
All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like you're all supposed to
[Chorus]
Oh, you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
[Verse 2]
Space around me where my soul can breathe
Off-guard body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters, I don't care what I miss
Company's okay, solitude is bliss
[Pre-Chorus]
There's a party in my head
And no one is invited
[Chorus]
And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
[Bridge]
Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one that's free
You and all your friends can watch me
Today
(Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel)
[Chorus]
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
