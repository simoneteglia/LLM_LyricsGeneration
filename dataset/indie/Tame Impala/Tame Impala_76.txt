[Intro: The Streets]
Call and call my phone, thinking I’m doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again
[Chorus: Tame Impala]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it
[Verse 1: The Streets]
You call and call my phone, thinking I’m doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can get back to it
How funny family is actually fuckin' has you in bits
Your mum has good genes, but Dad's are ripped
[Pre-Chorus: The Streets]
Dance like no one is awkward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about what they thought
If you knew how little they did
On to better things, they fucking love all of the guessing
Someone just met your ex, thinking they met someone special
[Chorus: Tame Impala]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it
[Verse 2: The Streets]
The phone is ringing, the phone is ringing
Can't use it 'til it stops
I moan and listen, the tone emits
The only man in black, hi-viz jackets in the cab
Brexit breakfast, Day-Glo stars, I am baggin' and dashin'
Whoever's with my ex needs to do better
She's still texting me at two 'til ten
Weird liquor tastes weirdly better when your life is fucked up
[Chorus: Tame Impala]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it
[Verse 3: The Streets]
You call and call my phone, thinking I’m doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again
Love isn't a riddle, love isn't made to be hard
You know I'd give you my kidney, just don't ever take my charger
[Pre-Chorus: The Streets]
So dance like no one is awkward to music listened to lit
You'd worry less about what they thought
If you knew how little they did
You call and call my phone thinking I’m doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again
[Chorus: Tame Impala]
I was gonna call you back, I swear
Just as soon as I felt up to it
It just hasn't happened yet
And I'm still gonna call you back one day
And you can tell me all the news
That you've been trying to, oh yeah
[Outro: The Streets &
Tame Impala
]
You call and call my phone, thinking I'm doing nothing better
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again
You call and call my phone (
I was gonna call you back
)
Thinking I'm doing nothing better (
I swear
)
I'm just waiting for it to stop so I can use it again
