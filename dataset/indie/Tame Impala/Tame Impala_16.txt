[Intro]
I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, Thursday, 12:30
I've got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But, in its reflection, just for a second
I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
"Who was that?" It was my lover
A lover from a past life
[Chorus]
From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life
[Interlude]
Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to black out regret
But it was real, it just feels like a past life
[Chorus]
From a past life
Crazy
From a past life
It takes a lot to trip me out
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time in a long time
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
[Interlude]
So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does
[Chorus]
From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I tried to say it but it never came out right)
Past life
From a past life
(You're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)
For the first time
(I know it's late, it just didn't feel right)
In a long time
[Outro]
Hello?
