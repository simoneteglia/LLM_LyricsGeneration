[Verse 1]
Goodnight, daylight
I won't remember you for long
Sleep tight, fistfight
Until December's come and gone
It's only late, you have time
With any reason that you find
[Verse 2]
Somewhere in slumber
Is someone who didn't see it coming
If all this leaves you behind
And everything starts to rewind
It doesn't mean anything
You won't remember what you see
It could take you a lifetime
A lifetime
[Chorus]
You got lost, lost to the night
It's no loss, you'll be alright
Tell me you'll feel better when you're sleeping through the day
And I'll tell you how you missed it when you wake
[Verse 3]
It doesn't mean anything
What you done or where you've been
It was a chance of a lifetime
[Chorus]
You got lost, lost to the night
It's no loss, you'll be alright
Tell me you'll feel better when you're sleeping through the day
And I'll tell you how you missed it when you wake
[Outro]
When you wake up
When you wake up
When you wake up
