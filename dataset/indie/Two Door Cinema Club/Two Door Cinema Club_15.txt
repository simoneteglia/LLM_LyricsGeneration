[Verse]
So what became of love in man?
And what became of you?
Familiar as you shook my hand
What was it you meant to do?
Because all can change for one
And all can change in this new day
[Chorus]
She said the devil will want you back
And you'll never find love in an open hand
Shut your eyes, so you see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you stay this man
She said the devil will want you back
And you'll never find love in an open hand
Shut your eyes, so you see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you stay this man
[Bridge]
I lie, this was not for my pride
I know this was my time
[Chorus]
She said the devil will want you back
And you'll never find love in an open hand
Shut your eyes, so you see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you stay this man
So when nobody will take you back
And you've never found love in an open hand
Shut your eyes and you'll see I'm there
And know you'll always have this if you stay this man
