[Verse 1]
We're low in our hearts, we're low in our heads
All in good time
[Chorus]
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
[Verse 2]
We're low in our hearts, we're low in our heads
All in good time
All will take charge, we'll all take our chances
All in good time
[Chorus]
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
