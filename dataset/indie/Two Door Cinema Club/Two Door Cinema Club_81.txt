[Verse 1]
It starts in the theatre, a night of encounters
If I hadn't been there, if not for a cigarette
[Chorus]
And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
We'll just keep talking on
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things
[Verse 2]
Difference in opinion was never an issue
Collect all your questions, 'cause this time we've all night
[Outro]
And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
We'll just keep talking on on, oh oh oh
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things, oh
And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
We'll just keep talking on
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things
