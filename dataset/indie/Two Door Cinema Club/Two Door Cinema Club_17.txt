[Verse 1]
Another Saturday, another careless move
Tells the world that you're thinking of what to do
A window opens up and someone calls your name
But I can tell you don't know how to play this game
[Pre-Chorus]
I know this isn't it (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
You'll hit your target someday (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Chorus]
So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home?
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength to find the strength to find another way
To find another way
To find another way
To find another way
[Verse 2]
So tell me what you need and I'll accommodate
But if too long goes by, you just might be too late
An opportunity you can't afford to waste
So have the lines in your head first, for heaven's sake
[Pre-Chorus]
You hear the day beckoning (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Know that it's all in your head (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Chorus]
So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home?
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength to find the strength to find another way
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home?
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength to find the strength to find another way
