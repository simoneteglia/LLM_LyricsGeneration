[Verse 1]
I, I won't come around
I wouldn't act your age
With no cloud in sight
We had predicted rain
Eyes down to your nose
Ask how my day has been
You don't wait for me
I'm working late again
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It was so nice to see you
You haven't changed at all
Down to the letter
I was a boy, I was a boy
[Chorus]
How is it always the same?
It's okay, I'm fine
I wait for something to change
I'm over the line
(I'm over the line)
How is it always the same?
It's okay, I'm fine
I wait for something to change
I'm over the line
(I'm over the line)
[Verse 2]
We've all been around
Working for the light, light, light, right?
To turn out, wait there
Back to the easy life
Who's in on the joke?
Can't see the funny side
Same time next week
I'll be a different guy
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was so nice to see you
Don't be a stranger now
You've got my number
Give me a call, give me a call
[Chorus]
How is it always the same?
It's okay, I'm fine
I wait for something to change
I'm over the line
(I'm over the line)
Why is it always a game?
There's no win, no pride
Wait for attention to fade
It's a cheap design
(I'm over the line)
[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle]
Over the line, yep, it's me again
I work them missteps and leave 'em in
I'm a Hordak, be my Evil-Lyn
Fade to black and the dream begins
I left my prison without a sound
Ball and chain weigh a thousand pounds
Mean no harm, we can pal around
At least 'til the ref call out of bounds
I don't need the playbook, I wrote one
I know this game is a cold one
Who can say? I guess we both won
Hold up, I know something that's more fun
Paid up, working the angles
Play moth and see what the flames do
Or break off and see when it came true
I break all the rules then blame you
Both went home with the NK
It's two different homes with the same tape
It's two different heads in the same space
Ultimate test of your game face
[Chorus]
How is it always the same?
It's okay, I'm fine
I wait for something to change
I'm over the line
(I'm over the line)
Why is it always a game?
There's no win, no pride
Wait for attention to fade
It's a cheap design
(I'm over the line)
