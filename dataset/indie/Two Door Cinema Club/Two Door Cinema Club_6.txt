[Verse 1]
Save me
I've been drinking wine
And I just made a big mistake
Happens all the time
Slay me
Come out from the dark
Sold my soul to television
Different kind of art
[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah
[Chorus]
We've got the time
Gonna work, it's worth it
Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me, my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions
[Verse 2]
Lately
Think I've had enough
Of generation information, every station
But I can't turn it off
So, baby
Why you look so sad?
You've been trying too hard, too hard to be happy
Where's the sense in that?
[Pre-Chorus]
We'll be okay
We'll be okay, ah
[Chorus]
We've got the time
Gonna work, it's worth it
Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me, my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions
[Bridge]
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation information
Generation
[Chorus]
We've got the time
Gonna work, it's worth it
Found the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Looking back at yourself
Fighter pilot vision
Outside the line
Oh, come to me, my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for everything later
I'm addicted to you
And I make bad decisions
