[Verse 1]
I don't know where I am going to rest my head tonight
So I won't promise that I'll speak to you today
But if I ever find another place, a better time
For that moment, I was never what I am
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me to where you are, what you've become
And what you will do when I am gone
I won't forget, I won't forget
[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
[Verse 2]
In between the lines is the only place you'll find
What you're missing but you didn't know was there
So when I say goodbye, you must do your best to try
And forgive me this weakness, this weakness
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know what to say, another day
Another excuse to be sent your way
Another day, another year
[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
[Post-Chorus]
And maybe sometime, in a long time
You'll remember what I had said there, I said
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
[Bridge]
If you think of me
I will think of you
[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
[Post-Chorus]
Maybe sometime, in a long time
You'll remember what I had said there, I said
I'll be home for next year
[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
