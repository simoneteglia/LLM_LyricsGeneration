[Intro]
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
[Verse 1]
You're the sacred cow
Stand up, take a bow, you're wonderful
You should be comfortable, don't think at all
Just don't think at all, think at all
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now, now you're digging a wreck
What will you write about?
How did you find that out?
You get paid (paid) and don't need any respect
Senses fading
,
she's no lady
[Chorus (Intro)]
Oh, we've made a mistake (Na na na na na)
We've lost our minds (Na na na na na)
We've lost our memory (Na na na na na)
Oh, what's it gonna take? (Na na na na na)
There's always something else (Na na na na na)
Waiting on the shelf (Na na na na na)
[Verse 2]
You could be president
You never paid the rent but I don't mind
You got no reason to learn what came first
It can't be good enough, good enough
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now, now you're throwing the stone
You never sympathize
Somebody shut your eye
What will you say with that mind of your own?
Are we ready? Hold it steady
[Chorus (Intro)]
Oh, we've made a mistake (Na na na na na)
We've lost our minds (Na na na na na)
We've lost our memory (Na na na na na)
Oh, what's it gonna take? (Na na na na na)
There's always something else (Na na na na na)
So occupy yourself (Na na na na na)
[Bridge]
I saw the world today
It comes in green and gray
Refrigerator hum
And chewing gum and instant karma
The war's a whore
And all the stores are bored with all your money
We follow what's to come
That's what they sold to me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now, now you're throwing the stone
You never sympathize
Somebody shut your eye
What will you say with that mind of your own?
Are we ready? Hold it steady
[Chorus (Pre-Chorus 2)]
(Now, now you're throwing the stone) Oh, we've made a mistake
We've lost our minds (You never sympathize)
We've lost our memory (Somebody shut your eye)
(What will you say)
Oh, what's it gonna take? (With that mind of your own)
There's always something else (Are we ready?)
Waiting on the shelf (Hold it steady)
