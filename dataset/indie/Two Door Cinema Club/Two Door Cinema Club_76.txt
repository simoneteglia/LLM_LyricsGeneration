[Verse 1]
It's always
A matter of time
If I can get what I want
I'll know it's not enough
I want excess (I want excess)
Just a little piece
I've got interest (I've got interest)
Lucky, lucky me
Lucky, lucky me
[Chorus]
High flyer
Dancing on your table
Tender dreams
We've got nothing going for free
(High flyer)
You've got all the zeros
(No one's giving up)
(No one's giving up)
[Skit]
What about you? Would you like to be a millionaire?
Oh yes, please!
Supposing you wanted to be a millionaire
How would you go about it?
What's the best way?
Well, um...
[Verse 2]
I will find
The ladder of sin
And when I get where I'm goin'
I won't ever quit
I'll get higher
Climbing over you
Lower, lower
Nothing I won't do
Lucky, lucky you
[Chorus]

I got some change
Selling time
I'll be buying mine
And the love I get (And the love I get)
If I could change
I'd be fine
Living on the line
For the thrill of it (For the thrill of it)
I got some change
Selling time
I'll be buying mine
And the love I get (And the love I get)
If I could change
I'd be fine
Living on the line
For the thrill of it (For the thrill of it)
