[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them
And I may go to places I have never been to, just to find
The deepest desires in my mind
[Instrumental Break]
[Post-Chorus]
He sleeps alone
[Verse 1]
Asleep
Is it so hard not to believe?
That we'll never know
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, hold hold hold
Hold me close
I've never been this far from home
Hold hold hold me close
[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them
And I may go to places I have never been to, just to find
The deepest desires in my mind
[Bridge]
It's in my head and I have said
That I must be like him now
He sleeps alone, he sleeps alone
And one last chance to make sense
Of what is long escaped ours
He sleeps alone, I sleep alone
[Instrumental Break]
Post-Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He sleeps alone
