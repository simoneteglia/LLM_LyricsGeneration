Da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Are you ready to move on?
But I can tell that you're holding onto things that won't fly
And I can tell you don't like it
And you're beginning to let go of the shit to get by
[Pre-Chrous]
So hold on, hold on to what you wanna do
It won't do you no harm
You can't tell, you can't tell what you're weakest for
You have to reconcile
[Chorus]
Things are slipping out of reach
And you are getting impatient, impatient, oh
Things are slipping out of reach
And you are getting impatient, impatient, oh
[Verse 2]
And I could see in the distance
But what a way that this was not what we wanted by far
We tried a different direction
It suited better to go this way than make life that hard
[Pre-Chorus]
So right now, right now is where I wanna be
You couldn't change my mind
You won't know, you won't know if it was good or bad
And leave it all behind
[Chorus]
Things are slipping out of reach
And you are getting impatient, impatient, oh
Things are slipping out of reach
And you are getting impatient, impatient, oh
[Outro]
