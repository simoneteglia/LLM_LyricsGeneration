[Verse 1]
Learn to fly, learn to fly
Show the world how you try
But don't let go until you know
Until you know me
'Cause I can see, I can see
All the things arresting me
But I control, I control
[Verse 2]
When I get home, when I get home
I want to feel less alone
I couldn't feel, I couldn't feel
Anybody
This isn't home, this isn't home
I couldn't feel more alone
I need to feel, I need to feel
Somebody
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I see the world
In different colours
To someone like you
[Chorus]
The city will pull you in
Romantic and drenched in sin, love
You only have but a time
Until this place will swallow you whole
[Bridge]
And everything I cannot imagine
This dim-lit room has seen much before me
And I don't want to ever know
To know
[Chorus]
The city will pull you in
Romantic and drenched in sin, love
You only have but a time
Until this place will swallow you whole
