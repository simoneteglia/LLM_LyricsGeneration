[Verse 1]
I'm a sinner, I'm the victim
I'm an alien when I'm myself
I'm a healer, I'm a fixer
I'm a present danger to my health
[Verse 2]
I'm so strong
Doing what I'm supposed to do
There's something wrong
With somebody like me
[Pre Chorus]
I've been here before, the warning
It opens up the door
And now I'm falling
[Chorus]
Why did I let it go?
Why did I leave myself?
No explanation as to why I'm here and not somewhere else
It's reaping what I sow
I think I need some help
I wanna let you in and I'll begin
[Verse 3]
One for science
One for Krishna
One for luck and one more for the road
I've been trying to find an answer
That I'm certain I will never know
I won't depend on something supernatural
I won't pretend that it's gotta be right for me
[Pre Chorus]
I've been here before, the warning
It opens up the door
And now I'm falling
[Chorus]
Why did I let it go?
Why did I leave myself?
No explanation as to why I'm here and not somewhere else
It's reaping what I sow
I think I need some help
I wanna let you in
Think I already know
It's out of my control
Found no solution but to let the pieces fall where they fall
Even with nothing left, I've got more than you know
I wanna let you in and we'll begin
[Verse 4]
I always simplify this all the time
Somehow I think that I'm alone
I wake up every day and change my mind
Good morning
[Pre Chorus]
I've been here before, the warning
It opens up the door
And now I'm falling
[Chorus]
Why did I let it go?
Why did I leave myself?
No explanation as to why I'm here and not somewhere else
It's reaping what I sow
I think I need some help
I wanna let you in
Think I already know
It's out of my control
Found no solution but to let the pieces fall where they fall
Even with nothing left, I've got more than you know
I wanna let you in and we'll begin
