[Verse 1]
Wait for
Something more
When you show
I follow
[Chorus]
A beacon that is calling me
The light that never dies
Reflections thrown above the sea
Cast shadows in the sky
Standing right in front of you
Is where I need to be
Reliving this as something new
And something finally
[Verse 2]
Take the deep end
And swim 'til you can stand
'Cause it will make a difference in the end
Trip the shutter
And keep the picture close
Save it until you need it the most
[Outro]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
