[Verse 1]
Monday's no good, can we leave it 'til another day?
I've got other things on my mind
And now we wait, and now we wait
And now we wait, and now we wait
It's not a problem, I've just got a lot to think about
It won’t be long 'til we forget it
Just now we wait, and now we wait
And now we wait, and now we wait
[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world as we know it
Take your ticket, have a seat and wait until it's over
'Cause I think you've been drinking too much coffee
To relax and enjoy the people singing
[Verse 2]
I could be seeing all the people that I want to
But an inconvenience just came up
I'll have to wait, I'll have to wait
I'll have to wait, I'll have to wait
Don't want an answer, it's a question to be left unspoken
Don't you wanna know what I've got?
You'll have to wait, you'll have to wait
You'll have to wait, you'll have to wait
[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world as we know it
Take your ticket, have a seat and wait until it's over
'Cause I think you've been drinking too much coffee
To relax and enjoy the people singing
It's not the end of the world as we know it
Take your ticket, have a seat and wait until it's over
'Cause I think you've been drinking too much coffee
To relax and enjoy the people singing
[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
