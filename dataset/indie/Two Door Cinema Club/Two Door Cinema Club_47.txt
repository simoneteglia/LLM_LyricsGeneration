[Verse 1]
You wanted everything
You couldn't have it all
You spent the life you never had
Climbing up the walls
It wouldn't let you in
You wouldn't cut the cord
You've only got yourself to blame
You know you could've had it
[Pre-Chorus]
(
Go
) Let's go to the richest town
(
Go
) Let's see what life's about, girl
You've only got one chance
To make a move this time
(
Go
) You're about to realise
(
Go
) What life is all about, girl
This is your final warning
[Chorus]
I want to show you everything
You can pretend it's real
[Verse 2]
So after everything
You're gonna give it up?
Just drop it all because it turns out
That you had bad luck?
I know your state of mind
You're not the quitting kind
You'll pick it up before you know
You had something to find
[Pre-Chorus]
(
Go
) Let's go to the richest town
(
Go
) Let's see what life's about, girl
You've only got one chance
To make a move this time
(
Go
) You're about to realise
(
Go
) What life is all about, girl
This is your final warning
[Chorus]
I want to show you everything
You can pretend it's real
I want to show you everything
You can pretend it's real
[Bridge]
And you know you can't beat time
You can't do everything at once
And you know you can't beat time
You can't do everything at once
And you know you can't beat time
You can't do everything at once
And you know you can't beat time
[Outro]
You've really got it now
You've got yourself made up
You've really got it now
You've got yourself made up
You've really got it now
You've got yourself made up
You've really got it now
