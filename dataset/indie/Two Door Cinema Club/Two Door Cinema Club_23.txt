[Verse 1]
There's a fire in my head
And it's keeping me from getting out of bed
Take the TV, take the rest
All my riches for a vision and a quest
[Pre Chorus]
How we turn
How we yearn
Plastic fern
Watch it burn
Hold my coke
Need a smoke
No, no, no
[Chorus]
Don't feel like getting home
We got that fever catching on
Feel religion and I get down on
Feeling good enough
Enough for me, enough for me
Vibration gets your bones
You take a picture with a telephone
She's a bitch and everything I want
'Cause she sets me free
I'll never be, I'll never be
[Verse 2]
I found out
I confuse desire and control
And maybe nothing's gonna save me
I'm in too deep
I cast the mould
[Pre Chorus]
How we turn
How we yearn
Plastic fern
Watch it burn
Hold my coke
Need a smoke
No, no, no
[Chorus]
Don't feel like getting home
We got that fever catching on
Feel religion and I get down on
Feeling good enough
Enough for me, enough for me
Vibration gets your bones
You take a picture with a telephone
She's a bitch and everything I want
'Cause she sets me free
I'll never be, I'll never be
[Verse 3]
I wanted some
I wanted something
But there ain't no trying now
I've got the pain
Somebody stop me
[Chorus]
Don't feel like getting home
We got that fever catching on
Feel religion and I get down on
Feeling good enough
Enough for me, enough for me
Don't feel like getting home
We got that fever catching on
Feel religion and I get down on
Feeling good enough
Enough for me, enough for me
Vibration gets your bones
You take a picture with a telephone
She's a bitch and everything I want
'Cause she sets me free
I'll never be, I'll never be
