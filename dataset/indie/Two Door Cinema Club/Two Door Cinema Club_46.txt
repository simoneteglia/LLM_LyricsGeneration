[Hook] (x3)
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You were a thud in the night
You're what we heard at night
[Bridge]
We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
We're high above your golden veins
The life, the life, the life
[Hook]
[Verse 1]
Oh let me walk around these walls
Correct your words forget my thoughts
And let you feel some life in here
Tonight, tonight, tonight
[Verse 2]
Swimming through the diamond sea
There's dancing lights surrounding me
Now high above your golden veins
The life, the life, the life
[Verse 3] (x4)
You are the only one
My soul it knows no one other than you
Oh you know I love you
[Hook]
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
Heard in the night
(4x)
[Bridge] (x2)
[Hook]
