I was wrong, I take it back
Now can we get along, pick up the slack
You know it all could be much easier
But I'm still travelling, I'm still travelling
And all the while, the people talk
About the unsound shit that they then stock
And use to please the crowds, the swarming hoards of folk
That watch on in sunglasses
So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take a guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
Take your time, make up your mind
Though it won't change the world, you'll be more inclined
To have a point of view that makes it through
And keeps you travelling, keeps you travelling
So pick your friends, and fuck the rest
You can't live life being second best
The critics talk of stubbornness
But you're just passionate, you're just passionate
So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take a guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take a guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take a guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
So if I'm wrong again, I apologize
You can take a guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
