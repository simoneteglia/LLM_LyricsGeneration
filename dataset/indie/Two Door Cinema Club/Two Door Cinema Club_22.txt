[Verse 1]
I came back to breathe the smoke
I've got a system and I'm usin' my head (Talk that talk)
Close enough to stay afloat
But you can sink with all the weight you've been fed (That talk)
[Pre-Chorus]
Pulled and pried, a push don't make it right
Lost so easily (Tell me what you're doin')
Top shelf guy, supermarket price
Don't think much of me (Tell me what you're doin')
(Just do it)
[Chorus]
I want it all
Don't stop givin', I like the way you talk (Just do it)
Don't hit the wall
Can't stop livin', do anything you want (Just do it)
Ooh (Just do it)
Ooh (Just do it)
[Verse 2]
Precious toys don't work for play
They make a killin' sittin' out of the game (Talk that talk)
Make that choice to be okay
There's nothin' to it when you're makin' it rain (That talk)
[Pre-Chorus]
Taking flight, fallin' from a height
Sounds the same to me (Tell me what you're doin')
Eyes shut tight, keepin' out the light
Means I disagree (Tell me what you're doin')
(Just do it)
[Chorus]
I want it all
Don't stop givin', I like the way you talk (Just do it)
Don't hit the wall
Can't stop livin', do anything you want (Just do it)
Ooh (Just do it)
Ooh (Just do it, just do it)
[Bridge]
Use somethin', prove somethin'
Now, now, now
Choose somethin', lose somethin'
Now, now, now
Do somethin', do somethin'
Do somethin', do somethin'
Do somethin', do somethin'
(Just do it)
[Chorus]
I want it all
Don't stop givin', I like the way you talk (Just do it)
Don't hit the wall
Can't stop livin', do anything you want (Just do it)
Ooh (Just do it)
Ooh (Just do it)
