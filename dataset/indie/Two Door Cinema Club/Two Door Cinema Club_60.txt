[Intro]
Parece que fueron muy felices
[Verse 1]
I flew too low
I got the blue smoke
Breathe in, break out
Elevate the cloud
The rain is coming
I did my time, I did it happily
But that's enough
Enough is enough
Count one to ten, start again, repeat
[Chorus]
Think what you're doing to me
'Cause I don't wanna think
When I'm taking the heat
You're giving me a lesson
I don't want you to teach
Oh, don't you ever think?
Don't you ever think?
[Verse 2]
It's no secret
So don't keep it
Let it out
I send my very best to anybody
The word around the water cooler
Walkin' the line
What's real or rumour?
So here's to them, a life of fantasy, see?
[Chorus]
Think what you're doing to me
'Cause I don't wanna think
When I'm taking the heat
You're giving me a lesson
I don't want you to teach
Oh, don't you ever think?
Don't you ever think?
[Post-Chorus]
Hold yourself to it
Hold yourself, hold yourself to it
Hold yourself to it
Hold yourself, hold yourself to it
Hold yourself to it
Hold yourself, hold yourself to it
