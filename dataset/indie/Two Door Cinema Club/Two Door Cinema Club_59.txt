[Verse 1]
You made it to the top just to get away
Guess you know what you've got, and that it's here to stay
I would make it all stop just to hear you say
That I made it to the top just to get away
[Chorus]
'Cause it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway (Anyway)
No, it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway
'Cause it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway (Anyway)
No, it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway
[Verse 2]
I can make you sing, and I can make you shout
We could go one day, not tryin' to get out
You should see your face, you should see your face
Just standing, waiting for the punches
[Chorus]
'Cause it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway (Anyway)
No, it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway
'Cause it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway (Anyway)
No, it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
'Cause it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway (Anyway)
No, it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway
'Cause it don't make a difference
And it don't make a difference anyway (Anyway)
No, it don't make a difference
It don't make a difference
