[Verse 1]
We're leaving today in search of a new life (Life)
We'll change our colours and change our shape
We're finding our way, we follow the blue light (Light)
And under cover of night, escape
[Chorus]
Still, we're all just animals, animals
I'm done (I'm done), you're on (You're on)
Tunnel out, tunnel out
It's a kind of miracle, miracle
Hard won (Hard won), then gone (Then gone)
Turn around, turn around
[Verse 2]
We're having our cake and eating the big slice
We've got thе hunger without the taste
Wе made a mistake, it's not what it looks like
A wrong turn somewhere along the way
[Chorus]
Still, we're all just animals, animals
I'm done (I'm done), you're on (You're on)
Tunnel out, tunnel out
It's a kind of miracle, miracle
Hard won (Hard won), then gone (Then gone)
[Bridge]
(New ground)
(New ground)
(New ground) Tunneling out
(New ground) Thinkin' aloud
(New ground) Always a crowd
(New ground) Never in doubt
Tunneling out
(New ground) Thinkin' aloud
Always a crowd
(New ground) Never in doubt
Tunneling out
(New ground) Thinkin' aloud
Always a crowd, always a crowd
[Chorus]
Still, we're all just animals, animals
I'm done (I'm done), you're on (You're on)
Tunnel out, tunnel out
It's a kind of miracle, miracle
Hard won (Hard won), then gone (Then gone)
Turn around
