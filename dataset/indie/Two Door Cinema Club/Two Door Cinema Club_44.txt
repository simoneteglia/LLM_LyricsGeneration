[Verse 1]
If I was to tell you that the hell you're living in's a starter
What it takes to survive with a wonderful life is harder
What do you get when you place all your bets outside you?
If you're holding your breath, it's no wonder it's yet to find you
[Verse 2]
Talk about it, but you never ever want to think about it
Keep talking, but you're never gonna find a way to make it fit
Watch as the world does a twist and a twirl without you
You can't make any sense when you're building a fence around you
[Chorus]
Take back your wonderful life
The more the lifе to love much better
Wе say it all of the time
The time is now, it's now or never
We all get it wrong
So don't stay mad for long
Or it's a lonely little life, lonely little lifetime
[Bridge]
But it's a sin that I can't understand what you meant
And I'm sorry that I can't get through
But if we choose to forget what we've come to regret
Oh, if we only knew
[Chorus]
Take back your wonderful life
The more the life to love much better
We say it all of the time
The time is now, it's now or never
We all get it wrong
So don't stay mad for long
Or it's a lonely little life, lonely little lifetime
Take back your wonderful life
The more the life to love much better
We say it all of the time
The time is now, it's now or never
We all get it wrong
So don't stay mad for long
Or it's a lonely little life, lonely little lifetime
