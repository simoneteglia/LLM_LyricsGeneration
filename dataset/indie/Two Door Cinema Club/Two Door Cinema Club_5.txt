[Verse 1]
Ocean blue
What have I done to you?
Cut so deep
Yet growing through and through
[Verse 2]
Drawn apart, New York and London
All I see now are distant drumlins
The roads I knew became a city
And I wonder, will you wait for me?
[Chorus]
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?
[Verse 3]
I built a hive, became one with the bees
But we fell like rain, got lost into the sea
If I don't know, the wind will carry me
So just hold tight
[Chorus]
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?
[Bridge]
Over and over many setting suns
I have run, I have waited for the rain to come
When through that mist, I see the shape of you
And I know, and I know that I'm in love with you
[Chorus]
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay
I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say?
What would you say?
What would you do?
