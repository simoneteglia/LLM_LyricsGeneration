[Verse 1]
Well, I've been lucky, I'm a lucky man
But I never saw this part of the plan
A double tricker hidden way back when
The entertainment's killing us again
[Chorus]
We're running out of luck
I can feel the change
Holding onto little pieces of what remains
And was it not enough?
We're blowing out the flame
Hoping that there's something coming
Is not the same, the same, the same
[Verse 2]
Well, how're you doing? I've been doing well
You've been great as far as I can tell
Well, you've been clever, you can play the game
All the glory without all the blame
[Chorus]
We're running out of luck
I can feel the change
Holding onto little pieces of what remains
And was it not enough?
We're blowing out the flame
Hoping that there's something coming
Is not the same, the same, the same
[Bridge]
Keep on pulling bricks out of the wall
I'll be right here waiting, ooh
Until you find that you can't go back again
Or put it back, put it back together
[Chorus]
We're running out of luck
I can feel the change
Holding onto little pieces of what remains
And was it not enough?
We're blowing out the flame
Hoping that there's something coming
Is not the same, the same, the same
