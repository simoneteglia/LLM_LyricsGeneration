[Verse 1]
Breathe in and reach in
For anything that will not let you go
Take me and hold me
Think of all the people that you know
[Pre-Chorus]
We've been staring down the barrel of a gun
But we found hope and comfort
In everyone
[Chorus]
Everything comes to an end
But who knows what tomorrow will send
We must wait for a sign
But be patient with time
Until then, we can start again
[Verse 2]
Leaving, so stranded
Without a way of finding its way back
But it will do, it's meant to
In no time, it will be sitting where you sat
[Pre-Chorus]
And the rain keeps coming
Trying to wash away the sun
But we still found hope and comfort
In everyone
[Chorus]
Everything comes to an end
But who knows what tomorrow will send
We must wait for a sign
But be patient with time
Until then, we can start again
[Bridge]
Well you could say
How time has flown
And I could stay here on my own
Or you could say
Welcome home, darling
This weathered hills and foreign skies
Captured in my lover's eyes
It always takes me by surprise, darling
[Chorus]
Everything comes to an end
But who knows what tomorrow will send
We must wait for a sign
But be patient with time
Until then, we can start again
