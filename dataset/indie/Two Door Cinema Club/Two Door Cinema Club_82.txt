[Verse 1]
Here's another story
Can't believe it's wrong
Keep it on the TV
Give 'em what they want
Blinded by the sight
We live by candlelight
It's not enough
[Chorus]
Won't somebody tell me what's going on?
Well, it could be heavy
Is that what you want?
[Verse 2]
Here's another siren
Ringing up ahead
Cy-cy-cylinders are firing
What we gonna get?
Tell us what you're frightened of
Just give it up, here's the flood
Sure enough, sure еnough
[Bridge]
Give me just a little bit of pеace instead
I've got only so much room inside my head
I've got better ways that I could use my time
Think of something else so I don't lose my mind
I know you're giving what we're asking for
But nothing good can come from opening that door
Everything's enough to keep us wanting more
And more and more and more and more and more and more
[Chorus]
Won't somebody tell me what's going on?
Well, it could be heavy
Is that what you want?
[Outro]
A little bit
A little bit
Till there's nothing stopping it
It's just a little bit
A little bit
Now there's nothing stopping it
Stopping it, stopping it
Stop it, stop it
