[Verse 1]
So far so good, I got my hands to catch
Whatever happens to fall past my head
If I could begin to understand that
What I miss is what I wanted (Is it true?)
The curtain call, the spotlight fades
into a dream
I had a couple nights ago
(And that was you)
A plastic doll, the silver lining to my pillowcase
What a show
[Chorus]
I think I'm out of luck again
Sympathy callin' out my name
I keep my distance from the sparks and gasoline
I'd start a fire all the same
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Was it me or was it someone else
Dressed in my skin, havin' fun? (I am)
I've had enough, I'm exposed and have no memory
Of what I've done
[Chorus]
I think I'm out of luck again
Sympathy callin' out my name
I keep my distance from the sparks and gasoline
I'd start a fire all the same
I think I'm out of luck again
Sympathy callin' out my name
I keep my distance from the sparks and gasoline
I'd start a fire all the same
