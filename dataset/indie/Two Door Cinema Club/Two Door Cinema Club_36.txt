[Verse 1]
You're too young, you're never gonna know what hit me
When I fell down in silence
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now
[Chorus]
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
[Verse 2]
You're too young, you're never gonna know what hit me
When I fell down in silence
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now
[Chorus]
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
[Verse 3]
It's what you get when you try to educate a black sheep
You can't, you won't, you never will
I'm gonna show you what it takes to see the future
It's hard but not impossible
[Chorus]
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
You think you know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Outro]
And I believe this costume party is over
Before it gets started
And I believe this costume party is over
And I believe this costume party is over
Before it gets started
And I believe this costume party is over
[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
