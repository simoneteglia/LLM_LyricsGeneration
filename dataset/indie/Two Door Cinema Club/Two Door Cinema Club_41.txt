[Verse 1]
Take a step outside your house
And have a look around, it's all the same to me
Tiny places hold for you
Many memories that only you describe
[Chorus]
New, new, new, new
New, new, new, new
[Verse 2]
It's going to take a while to change
Get used to the journeys home on stormy nights
Weekends never far away
You two could always come and stay, it's all alright
[Chorus]
New, new, new, new
New, new, new, new
[Bridge]
And all this in different houses
We'll all get what we wish that we pray for
And all this in different houses
[Outro]
We'll all get
We'll all get
We'll all get
We'll all get
