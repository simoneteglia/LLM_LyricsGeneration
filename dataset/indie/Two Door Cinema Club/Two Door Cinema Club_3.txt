[Verse 1]
There's a spanner in the works, you know
You gotta step up your game to make it to the top
So go
Got a little competition now
You're going to find it hard to cope with living on your own now
Uh oh, uh oh
[Chorus]
Let's make this happen, girl
We gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you, and you know that it will
Let's get this started, girl
We're moving up, we're moving up
It's been a lot to change but you will always get what you want
[Verse 2]
It took a little time to make a little better
It's only going up, just one thing then another
You know, you know
It took a little time to make a little better
It's only going up, just one thing then another
You know, you know
[Chorus]
Let's make this happen, girl
We gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you, and you know that it will
Let's get this started, girl
We're moving up, we're moving up
It's been a lot to change but you will always get what you want
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Let's make this happen, girl
We gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you, and you know that it will
Let's get this started, girl
We're moving up, we're moving up
It's been a lot to change but you will always get what you want
Let's make this happen, girl
We gotta show the world that something good can work
And it can work for you, and you know that it will
Let's get this started, girl
We're moving up, we're moving up
It's been a lot to change but you will always get what you want
