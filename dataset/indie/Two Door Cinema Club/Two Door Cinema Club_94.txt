Ocean blue
What have I done to you?
Cut so deep
Yet growing through and through
Drawn apart
New York and London
All I see now
Are distant drumlins
The roads I knew
Became a city
And I wonder
Will you wait for me?
Although
I'm far away
I know I'll stay, I know I'll stay
Right there with you
Though
It might be too late
What would you say? What would you say?
What would you do?
I built a hive
Became one with the bees
But we fell like rain
Got lost into the sea
If I don't know
The wind will carry me
So just hold tight
Though
I'm far away
I know I'll stay, I know I'll stay
Right there with you
And though
It might be too late
What would you say? What would you say?
What would you do?
Over and over many setting suns
I have run, I have waited for the rain to come
When through that mist I see the shape of you
And I know, and I know that I'm in love with you
Though
I'm far away
I know I'll stay, I know I'll stay
Right there with you
And though
It might be too late
What would you say? What would you say?
What would you do?
