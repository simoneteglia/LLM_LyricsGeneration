[Verse 1]
I said I'd write you a letter
That much is true
But that much I've forgotten (forgotten)
Just as well 'cause I've nothing new
Oh, I could tell you all about it
I am the tree, I fell
But I think you could live without it
I can't get enough
And it's your fault
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
I knew the crown would be heavy
But what a view
The sun don't reach the valley
If you want, it could shine right through
But the good work hurts and wraps around you
A lack of oxygen
Just keep on smiling, all the clowns do
And we'll meet again
So disappear
[Instrumental Break]
(Disappearer)
(Disappearer)
(Disappearer)
(Disappearer)
[Outro]
There's no reason here we should fear
(Disappearer)
A good reason here to disappear
(Disappear)
There's no reason here we should fear
(Disappearer)
A good reason here to disappear
