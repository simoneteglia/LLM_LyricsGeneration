[Verse 1]
Nights were young
I was invincible
I was living for myself
My survival suicidal cool
You can't live that way
And I find myself begging you
I'd pretend I was good to you
That you were always on my mind
And for a moment you believed it too
But I can't lie forever
And you found the truth haunting you
Haunting you
[Chorus]
I know you're leaving
'Cause I always take too long
'Cause I always get it wrong
I'm a fool, I'm not defeated
You're the only one I love
I've got to find a way to make things right with you
I never wanted you to save me
Another question holding you
What answer makes you mine?
[Verse 2]
Every day I see him beside you
Is he treating you alright?
The things I'd do if I was in his shoes
No more taking for granted
Everything I get from you
Get from you
[Chorus]
I know you're leaving
'Cause I always take too long
'Cause I always get it wrong
I'm a fool, I should've seen it
It's gonna be a lonely, lonely road ahead
If I can't find a way to make things right with you
Yeah, I admit it
But before you walk away
I only need the chance to tell you how I feel
I'm not defeated
You're the only one I love
I've got to find a way to make things right with you
[Bridge]
You were never gonna save me
Don't see the difference in a maybe
Maybe I missed the point
The answer was a lesson too late
[Chorus]
I know you're leaving
'Cause I always take too long
'Cause I always get it wrong
I'm a fool, I should've seen it
It's gonna be a lonely, lonely road ahead
If I can't find a way to make things right with you
Yeah, I admit
But before you walk away
I only need the chance to tell you how I feel
I'm not defeated
You're the only one I love
I've got to find a way to make things right with you
