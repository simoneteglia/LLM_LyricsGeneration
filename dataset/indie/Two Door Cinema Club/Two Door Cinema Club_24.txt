[Verse 1]
I was wrong, I take it back
Now can we get along, pick up the slack?
You know it all could be much easier
But I'm still travelling, I'm still travelling
And all the while, the people talk
About the unsound shit, that they then stock
And use to please the crowds, the swarming hordes of folk
That watch on in sunglasses
[Chorus]
So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess,
I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
[Verse 2]
Take your time, make up your mind
Though it won't change the world, you'll be more inclined
To have a point of view that makes it through
And keeps you travelling, keeps you travelling
So pick your friends, forget the rest
You can't live life being second best
The critics talk of stubbornness
But you're just passionate, you're just passionate
[Chorus]
So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
So if I'm wrong again, I apologise
You can take your guess, I'll take out my eyes
It's a common thing to be out of line
But it's getting old by the fifteenth time
