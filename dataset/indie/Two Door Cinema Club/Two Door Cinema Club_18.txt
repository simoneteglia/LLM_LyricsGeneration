[Verse 1]
Six hours and I feel the same
Black powder and acid rain
What's a girl to do?
Be as sweet as you
I have to go
You said you're drunk, I said, "I know"
You said you think I'm gonna let you drive home
I've made a list
I think you owe me this
What do you know?
[Pre-Chorus]
If you close your eyes and listen to what's right outside your door
You won't be giving in
[Chorus]
Go ahead, just cover it up
Let's pretend we're ordinary
We could be in heaven
But it's never enough
It's mine
If the world's so mysterious
How can we be ordinary?
Everything is easy
Everybody is stuck
And that's fine
[Verse 2]
Cracked mirror brings seven years
But your luck never disapears
You'll be history if future disagrees
Take me home
What do you want?
What do you need?
It's hard to separate the goodness and the greed
When the walls cave in
We shed our infant skin
And then we grow
[Pre-Chorus]
If you close your mind to what's happening right outside your door
You're only giving in
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Go ahead, just cover it up
Let's pretend we are ordinary
We could be in heaven
But it's never enough
It's mine
[Bridge]
How far? How long?
Till this road's overgrown
What now? Be strong
There must be something going on
Somebody has to know, somebody has to know
Nobody wants to know
They got it wrong
[Chorus]
Go ahead, just cover it up
Let's pretend we're ordinary
We could be in heaven
But it's never enough
It's mine
If the world's so mysterious
How can we be ordinary?
Everything is easy
Everybody is stuck
And that's fine
