[Verse 1]
People say we've got it made
Don't they know we're so afraid?
I-Isolation
[Verse 2]
We're afraid to be alone
Everybody got to have a home
I-Isolation
[Verse 3]
Just a boy and a little girl
Tryin' to change the whole wide world
I-Isolation
[Verse 4]
The world is just a little town
Everybody trying to put us down
I-I, I-I
Isolation
[Bridge]
I don't expect you to understand
After you've caused so much pain
But then again, you're not to blame
You're just a human, a victim of the insane
[Verse 5]
We're afraid of everyone
Afraid of the sun
I-Isolation
[Verse 6]
The sun will never disappear
But the world may not have many years
I-I, I-I
Isolation
