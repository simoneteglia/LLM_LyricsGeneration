[Verse 1]
Meditation
Pre-vacation
Original by design
So dig in deep
Like the perfect creature
Guilty preacher
Is usin' the nine-to-five
To work on sleep
[Pre-Chorus]
Pour the champagne, leave the party
Play the game 'til everybody's won
We're the ones to carry on
We are the satellite
[Chorus]
Set the reaction (Oh)
Ticket to ride (Oh)
Reckless abandon (Oh)
Time on your side (Oh)
Into the future (Oh)
The water is fine (Oh)
We're goin' places
You're comin' with us
[Verse 2]
Conversation
Limitation
Security over time
The final stride
Trust the temporary
Visionary
Delivery overnight
Return denied
[Pre-Chorus]
Write the words and read the pictures
Flightless birds are gettin' richer from
The desire to carry on
They are the satellites
[Chorus]
Set the reaction (Oh)
Ticket to ride (Oh)
Reckless abandon (Oh)
Time on your side (Oh)
Into the future (Oh)
The water is fine (Oh)
We're goin' places
You're comin' with us
Divine intervention (Oh)
Lower the bar (Oh)
Be the exception (Oh)
Pocket the time (Oh)
Careful description (Oh)
History made (Oh)
We're goin' places
In it together
[Bridge]
You
Think
We
Are
Together
You
Want
Answers
Right
[Chorus]
Set the reaction (Oh)
Ticket to ride (Oh)
Reckless abandon (Oh)
Time on your side (Oh)
Into the future (Oh)
The water is fine (Oh)
We're goin' places
You're comin' with us
Divine intervention (Oh)
Lower the bar (Oh)
Be the exception (Oh)
Pocket the time (Oh)
Careful description (Oh)
History made (Oh)
We're goin' places
In it together
