[Verse 1]
Can we turn this off?
Can we put it away for another time?
Because your silence is hard
Because unspoken words are bliss to me
And you're out of touch
And you cannot find a way to me
And it’s all, it's you
We'll find another way to be
[Chorus]
Don’t you tell me to follow my dreams
I'm only nineteen, I'll catch you up, I'll catch you up
And don't you tell me of what I could see
Your conscious has suffered enough, enough
[Verse 2]
This is a modern war
There is no reason to use any other words
You can't sit back and relax
As your boy is just calling out for you
So don't mix your words
When you're tryin’ to make it up to me
There’s a place that you've gone
And you’ll find that it's no good place to be
[Chorus]
Don't you tell me to follow my dreams
I'm only nineteen, I’ll catch you up, I'll catch you up
And don't you tell me of what I could see
Your conscious has suffered enough, enough
[Outro]
So hold it down, boy
So hold it down, boy
So hold it down, boy
So hold it down
So hold it down, boy
So hold it down, boy
So hold it down, boy
So hold it down, boy
