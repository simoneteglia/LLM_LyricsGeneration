[Verse 1]
There was a fight
In a basement tonight
Some folks sighed relief
Others cried
For the man
Who'd been stripped of his pride
And I remember his face
Felt the sadness
Replacing the grace
The taste is still on my lips
Losing grip my finger tips the cigarette
[Chorus]
Something good, something strange
Oh, I never knew what you wanted anyway
It's a lie, it's a game
And I'm a sucker for feeling this way
Oo-oh
[Verse 2]
Over the sun
Since you climbing out the walls
I would let you go
You soon wake up in the same room as yesterday
I don't bother trying to leave
I just disappear out both of my sleeves
Pay no attention, pay no mind
I was talking to you the whole time
[Chorus]
Something good, something strange
Oh, I never knew what you wanted anyway
It's a lie, it's a game
And I'm a sucker for feeling this way
Oo-oh
[Verse 3]
Keep the light on for me
Tell me I'm crazy
Mysteries gone for free floating out
Out of reach
Say it so
Make it change
And I look like I'm playing the game
You can't have it all
Dead weight falls on me
