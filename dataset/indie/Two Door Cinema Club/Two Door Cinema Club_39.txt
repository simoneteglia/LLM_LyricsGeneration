[Verse 1]
Well, I've been waiting for that kind of lie
Satisfaction guaranteed
(Closer to heaven)
You'll find your way to getting what you like
Love, ambition, or greed
(Closer to heaven)
Sign up, tick it off, get the numbers
Try this, that missed, don't cry
More stuff til; nothing is enough and I want to try
[Chorus]
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(A paradise in the way)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(A paradise in the way)
The rising star
(Buried deep in the roots)
Family car
(It's awake)
Homemade television
(Won't come up that easily)
Under the waves
(Buried deep in the roots)
Of lemonade
(It's awake)
Worldwide exhibition
(Won't come up that easily)
[Verse 2]
Paint a picture from the other side
What you get is what you see
(Closer to heaven)
Could do better if you only tried
Stay connected for free
(Closer to heaven)
Get stuck, nip and tuck, get the hunger
Full steam, wet dream, deep fry
Feedback is falling through the cracks and I want to try
[Chorus]
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(A paradise in the way)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(A paradise in the way)
The rising star
(Buried deep in the roots)
Family car
(It's awake)
Homemade television
(Won't come up that easily)
Under the waves
(Buried deep in the roots)
Of lemonade
(It's awake)
Worldwide exhibition
(Won't come up that easily)
[Bridge]
Turning the tide
Holding a candle
Up to the sunlight
Fixing the fight
Hoping to try
[Chorus]
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(A paradise in the way)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(Bliss awaits)
Heaven
(A paradise in the way)
The rising star
(Buried deep in the roots)
Family car
(It's awake)
Homemade television
(Won't come up that easily)
Under the waves
(Buried deep in the roots)
Of lemonade
(It's awake)
Worldwide exhibition
(Won't come up that easily)
