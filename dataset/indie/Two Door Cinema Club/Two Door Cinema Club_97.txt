No
My only goal is to see
When I'm only fast asleep
It takes more than strength to find
This piece of mind
So I'll hold, hold, hold, hold it close to my heart
Beating with every step
Hold, hold, hold it close
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed
'Cause he knows that they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can see them oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to
Just to find
The deepest desires in my mind
We, we only know what we see
'Cause we're always fast asleep
Is it so hard not to believe
That we'll never know
Oh hold, hold, hold, hold me close
I've never been this far from home
Hold, hold, hold me close
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed
'Cause he knows that they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind
It's in my head
And I have said
That I must be like him, no
He sleeps alone, he sleeps alone
And one last chance to make sense
Of what has long escaped us
He sleeps alone, I sleep alone
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed
'Cause he knows that they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can see them, oh
And I don't know
If in the morning I will be here
And if so, let it be known
That I was worthy, I was worthy, I was worthy, I was
Oh
