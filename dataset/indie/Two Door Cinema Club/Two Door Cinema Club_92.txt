Feel something right and feel some good
Because if one thing works you might know it's true
'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
And if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
One year, 5 days and we're starting new
Try to make a change, it's one more thing to do
'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
And if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
Then who'd argue?
