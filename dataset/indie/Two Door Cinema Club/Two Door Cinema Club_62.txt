[Verse 1]
Run away, sugar dancing on your tongue
Any way to grow up and stay young
You're getting stuck with papers and the magazines
It's just your luck, the strangers living out your dream
[Chorus]
Once in a lifetime
You give it away soon as you found it
Another day, another breaking wave
Can't live without it
[Verse 2]
Company, a shadow playing on the wall
And suddenly, you don't miss it at all
You're keeping up; soon, you're gonna be a star
And that's enough to know for certain who you are
[Chorus]
Once in a lifetime
You give it away soon as you found it
Another day, another breaking wave
Can't live without it
Another breaking wave
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Once in a lifetime
You give it away soon as you found it
Another day, another breaking wave
Can't live without it
Another breaking wave
