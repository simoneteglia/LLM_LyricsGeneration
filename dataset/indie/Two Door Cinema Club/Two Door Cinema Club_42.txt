[Verse 1]
Take me through the pyramid
Show us life and things that you did
Each and every thing I see
Takes me back before I was me
[Chorus]
We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that's ever been and will become
[Verse 2]
Where are all these singing birds?
We would say, but that's not what we heard
[Chorus]
We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that's ever been and will become
We have seen the world for what it's worth
Everything that's in between can still be done
[Bridge]
Just one day is all that we needed
So we could believe it all
In some way, we already knew it
We just had to prove it all
[Chorus]
We have seen what lies beneath the earth
Everything that's ever been and will become
We have seen the world for what it's worth
Everything that's in between can still be done
