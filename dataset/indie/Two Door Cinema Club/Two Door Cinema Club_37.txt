[Verse 1]
Why do you always talk about
The wrong way in and the wrong way out?
It's only going to be as easy
As you make it for yourself
[Pre-Chorus]
Talk, talk, talk
Don't you know where you wanna go?
Start something new
Don't you know where you wanna go?
[Chorus]
What did I teach you that money didn't know?
And what have you learned of how far it goes?
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
What did I teach you that money didn't know?
And what have you learned of how far it goes?
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
[Verse 2]
I've been thinking of a way
To get out of what I have made
If only I could tell myself
To be a little more productive
[Pre-Chorus]
Talk, talk, talk
Don't you know where you wanna go?
Start something new
Don't you know where you wanna go?
[Chorus]
What did I teach you that money didn't know?
And what have you learned of how far it goes?
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
What did I teach you that money didn't know?
And what have you learned of how far it goes?
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
What did I teach you that money didn't know?
And what have you learned of how far it goes?
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
What did I teach you that money didn't know?
And what have you learned of how far it goes?
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
They're my kids, you know
