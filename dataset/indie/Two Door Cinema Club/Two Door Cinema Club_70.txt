[Verse 1]
I still believe, I wonder
Give me something more
If I don't feel any younger
Show me to the door
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been so many people
Still, I am one; the one you've never met
Waiting to say when
I've still got time, it's easy to forget
[Chorus]
I have something better than anybody else
I've landed
I have something better than anybody else
I've landed
Thought about it, talked about it, forgot about it
I've landed
Thought about it, talked about it, forgot about it
I've landed
I have something better than anybody else
I've landed
I have something better than anybody else
[Verse 2]
I keep the pace, keep my distance
Go a different speed
Another page, resistance
I could take the lead
[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen so many people
Beat that drum, the pattern in my head
Save a dance for me
I'm coming home with nothing to regret
[Chorus]
I have something better than anybody else
I've landed
I have something better than anybody else
I've landed
Thought about it, talked about it, forgot about it
I've landed
Thought about it, talked about it, forgot about it
I've landed
[Bridge]
I left the motor running
I left the game
I left the motor running
Out in the rain
I left the motor running
I left the game
I left the motor running
Out in the rain
I left the motor running
[Chorus]
I have something better than anybody else
I have something better than anybody else
I've landed
I have something better than anybody else
I have something better than anybody else
