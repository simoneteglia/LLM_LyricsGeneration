[Verse]
If I could break down the wall
I could see myself as someone I didnâ€™t know
I could shape rock and roll
But all I get is a louder echo
[Chorus]
So I disappear into another day
But what can I do? Is it 'cause I'm too lazy?
I can think until I've nothing left to say
So what should I do? Is it too late to save me?
[Outro]
Save me, baby
Now save me
Now is it too late?
Too late, too late
Is it too late? Too late
Is it too late now?
