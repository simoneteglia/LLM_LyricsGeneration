[Verse 1: Alex Trimble]
Everyone is here except for me
And I can feel the world is watching
Who is on their own? I wonder
And who has cast this spell I'm under?
[Chorus: Valentina]
I want you with me
I want you with me
[Verse 2: Alex Trimble,
Alex Trimble & Valentina
]
Look into your heart, are you happy?
You could be the one to set me free
And with your hand in mine, we will run
To a place that knows no one
[Chorus: Valentina]
I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me (And I want you with me)
I want you with me
[Bridge: Alex Trimble,
Alex Trimble & Valentina
]
I won't forget the things you said
They're dancing and singing inside my head
You've always known you're not alone
[Chorus: Valentina]
I want you with me
I want you with me
I want you with me (And I want you with me)
I want you with me (Want you with me)
