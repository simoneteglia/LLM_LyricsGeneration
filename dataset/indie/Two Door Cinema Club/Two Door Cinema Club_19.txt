[Verse 1]
I gave myself to the city, I wanna breathe dirty air
I got myself real pretty, I fixed up my hair
And when that dancehall's set to break
I wanna leave with the best I know
When that anger takes its shape
I will be leaving the best in show
[Pre-Chorus]
Give me your time, I'll give you plenty of mine
Or give me something to burn, I'm tired of waiting my turn
I'll give you fire, fire, fire, fire
Smoking, broken windows, limbos
Anything you wanna try
[Chorus]
The sky is fallin', so pull up a chair
Everyone's watchin', but nobody cares
The queen of fashion, ahead of her time
Whatever happens, the pleasure is mine
[Verse 2]
I'm picking up the pieces of that stained glass pane
And as my speed increases, I strip off my shame
I slip the hook right off the bait
I'm a machine running self-control
Got a tongue that doesn't quite translate
Lickin' somebody else's bowl
[Pre-Chorus]
Give me the vine and I'll give you the wine
Bring anything that will burn and you'll get fire in return
We'll start a fire, fire, fire, fire
Blazing, raising hell now, well, now
Anything to catch your eye
Anything to catch your eye
[Chorus]
The sky is fallin', so pull up a chair
Everyone's watchin', but nobody cares
The queen of fashion, ahead of her time
Whatever happens, the pleasure is mine
The sky is fallin', so pull up a chair
Everyone's watchin', but nobody cares
The queen of fashion, ahead of her time
Whatever happens, the pleasure is mine
[Bridge]
I said there's bread in Bethlehem
I said there's bread in Bethlehem
There's funds to pay your bills in Bethlehem
More to drink that you know, in Bethle—
Everything you need is in Bethlehem
'Cause that's where Jesus is
That you know, in Bethle—
[Chorus]
The sky is fallin', so pull up a chair
Everyone's watchin', but nobody cares
The queen of fashion, ahead of her time
Whatever happens, the pleasure is mine
The sky is fallin', so pull up a chair
Everyone's watchin', but nobody cares
The queen of fashion, ahead of her time
Whatever happens, the pleasure is all mine
[Outro]
(
To pay your bills in Bethlehem

More to drink that you know, in Bethle—

Everything you need is in Bethle—
