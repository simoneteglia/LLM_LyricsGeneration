You won't believe what I tell you
White coats and clever minds will choose
You get a lot from this
Loose tongue and arrogance
It's not appropriate
Don't think that this is it
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
A longer sentence brings no more
Than one that I had said before
It's hard to compromise
When I see through your eyes
It's just a common view
I guess it's lost on you
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
