[Verse 1]
Communication had a simple life, life
I played the dial tone that changed your mind
I was the information in disguise
I'd love to tell you about yourself
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know, I know you're leaving
I hope, I hope we keep on dreaming
[Chorus]
Thinkin' it's a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
I want to feel your love
And it's such a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
We could've lived together as one
[Verse 2]
I keep on blinking the last of my light, light
As my connection fades, I close my eyes
Still I will sing the song you hear at night
Keep you remembering me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know, I know nobody's sleeping
[Chorus]
Thinkin' it's a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
I want to feel your love
And it's such a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
We could've lived together as one
[Bridge]
I let you down, down
I need attention
Imagination works
For better or for worse
[Chorus]
Thinkin' it's a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
I want to feel your love
And it's such a damn shame to let it go
(Already gone)
We could've lived together as
