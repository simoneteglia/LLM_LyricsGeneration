[Verse 1]
I disappeared last night
While sleeping in my bed
A field of lavender beneath my head
Another planet, I'll try to map it
No user interface
It won't escape me again
[Pre Chorus]
And if I sleep tonight
The cosmic radiation
I won't complain
Maybe I can find the right frequency and station
I might just stay
[Chorus]
Don't wake up
I'll be here for centuries
Sweet magnetic energy
Nothing quite like this ever has existed
But God knows how I missed it
Gravity is losing its hold
Ho-oh-oh-old
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing its hold
Ho-o-o-old
I can feel it fading
Gravity is fading
[Verse 2]
I'll float on endlessly
Senses eluding me
There's no horizon to this open sea
Now that I'm giving it another chance
Giving luck a chance
I'll find something someday
[Pre Chorus]
And if I sleep tonight
The cosmic radiation
I won't complain
Maybe I can find the right frequency and station
I might just stay
[Chorus]
Don't wake up
I'll be here for centuries
Sweet magnetic energy
Nothing quite like this ever has existed
But God knows how I missed it
Gravity is losing its hold
Ho-o-o-old
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing its hold
Ho-o-o-old
I can feel it fading
Gravity is fading
[Outro]
Gravity is losing its hold
Ho-o-o-old
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing its hold
Ho-o-o-old
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing control
Tro-o-o-ol
I can feel it fading
Gravity is losing control
Tro-o-o-ol
I can feel it fading
Gravity is fading
