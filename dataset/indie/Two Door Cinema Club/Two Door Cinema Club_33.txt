[Verse 1]
I had watched you taking in the spring
Through dusty, sun-kissed bodies wandering
Between you and me, as if they don't see this distraction
This beautiful view, this delicate you in the way
[Chorus]
If I follow you tonight and leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love, forgotten love
If I follow you, then I will need you closer
One more day is not enough
[Verse 2]
Anything that I could ask of you
Is more than anything that I could do
What did I say? I cannot say I remember
But every word seems so absurd, my love
[Chorus]
If I follow you tonight and leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love, forgotten love
If I follow you, then I will need you closer
One more day is not enough
[Bridge]
I don't mind if all this time
Is all we have to spend
Ever me, I carelessly pretend
[Chorus]
If I follow you tonight and leave tomorrow
If it's all forgotten love, forgotten love
If I follow you, then I will need you closer
One more day is not enough
