Save me
I've been drinking wine
And I just made a big mistake
Happens all the time
Slay me
Come out from the dark
Sold my soul to television
Different kind of art
We've got the time
Gonna work its worth and find the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Don't get mad at yourself
Find it on the televisions
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for every little thing we've made
I'm addicted to you
I make bad decisions
Lately
Think I've had enough
Of generation information every station
And I can't turn it off
So baby
Why you look so sad?
You've been trying too hard, too hard to be happy
Where's the sense in that?
We've got the time
Gonna work its worth and find the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Don't get mad at yourself
Find it on the televisions
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for every little thing we've made
I'm addicted to you
I make bad decisions
I'm addicted to you
(I'm addicted to you)
I make bad decisions
(I make bad decisions)
We've got the time
Gonna work its worth and find the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Don't get mad at yourself
Find it on the televisions
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for every little thing we've made
I'm addicted to you
I make bad decisions
We've got the time
Gonna work its worth and find the perfect crime
You don't need to know what everybody's thinking
Don't get mad at yourself
Find it on the televisions
Outside the line
Oh, come to me my fantasy tonight
I'll apologize for every little thing we've made
I'm addicted to you
I make bad decisions
