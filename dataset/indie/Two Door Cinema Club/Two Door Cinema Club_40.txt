[Verse 1]
I first let a cat out of the bag
It scratched my eyes out and ordered me to go
To answer all these questions I've had
Will it all become clear? Will it all become clear now?
[Chorus]
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back and get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back and get her
[Verse 2]
When I found that the ice was going to melt
The seagulls kept on rotting on the ground
Would you answer all the questions I had?
Will it all become clear? Will it all become clear now?
[Chorus]
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back and get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back and get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
Go back, get her, go back, get her
[Bridge]
There’s four words we're standing on
There’s four words we're standing on
[Outro]
Four words, we're standing on ghosts
Four words, we're standing on ghosts
Four words, we're standing on ghosts
Four words, we're standing on ghosts
