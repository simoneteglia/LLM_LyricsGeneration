[Verse 1]
So it's over, I didn't realize
It's so much colder
But it was no surprise
Did you ever get to know me?
'Cause it has never been so plain to see
[Chorus]
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore
[Verse 2]
The door is open, you whispered to me
As you stood frozen in deep uncertainty
I hope that you know what I am thinking
Before you go with your heart sinking
[Chorus]
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore
, anymore
Anymore
[Bridge]
You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"
You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"
You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"
You said "Come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night with me"
[Chorus]
And when you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's untrue
'Cause every day since you left me
I thought less and less of you
And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore
