Stop!
The train is riding
Down to the station where you lived
When we were school kids
Hey!
The rails are caught now
And I am falling down
Fools in a spiral
Round this town of steam
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
Stop!
The train is riding
Down to the station where I lived
When I was a cool kid
Hey!
Is it my fault that
The fallen embers burn
Down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
And it rides out of town
Oh, it’s my road (x6)
It’s my war (X3)
His eyes are open(x2)
Oh, 'cause I want more
I want more
Want more
His eyes are open (X2)
Hey! Hey! Hey!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
My Body tells me no!
But I won’t quit
' Cause I want more, 'cause I want more!
And it rides out of town
