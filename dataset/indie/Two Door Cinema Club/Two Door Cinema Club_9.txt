[Verse 1]
Know my only goal is to see
When I'm only fast asleep
It takes more than strength to find
This peace of mind
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll hold, hold, hold
Hold it close
To my heart beating with every step
Hold, hold, hold it close
[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind
[Verse 2]
We, we only know what we see
'Cause we're always fast asleep
Is it so hard not to believe
That we'll never know?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, hold, hold, hold
Hold me close
I've never been this far from home
Hold, hold, hold me close
[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I may go
To places I have never been to just to find
The deepest desires in my mind
[Bridge]
It's in my head and I have said
That I must be like him now
He sleeps alone
He sleeps alone
And one last chance to make sense
Of what has long escaped us
He sleeps alone
I sleep alone
[Chorus]
He sleeps alone
He needs no army where he's headed 'cause he knows
That they're just ghosts
And they can't hurt him if he can't see them, oh
And I don't know
If in the morning I will be here, and if so
Let it be known
That I was worthy, I was worthy, I was worthy, I was
