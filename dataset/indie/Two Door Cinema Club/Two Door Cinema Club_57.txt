In a few weeks I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving, this is starting to feel like
It's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
Maybe next year I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you could have attained
Why try anything?
I will get there, just remember I know
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
