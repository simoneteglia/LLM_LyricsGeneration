[Verse 1]
And then I drew my line
Oh, what a twisted crime
Sink, float, sink, float, sink, float, sink
In pursuit of looking good
You must do everything you should
Why think? Don't think
Why, why?
[Chorus]
Sing to me
You're so pretty
I'm a girl, I'm a ghost, I'm a gameshow
Nobody wants me
Fried over-easy
Say my name, name
Insane, insane
[Verse 2]
I'm a Lynchian dream
I'm made of plasticine
I'm old Pinocchio, broken nose, let me go
Iâ€™ll be the souvenir
Of this cheap champagne year
Spilling bubbles on designer clothes
[Chorus]
Sing to me
You're so pretty
I'm a girl, I'm a ghost, I'm a gameshow
Nobody wants me
Fried over-easy
Say my name, name
Insane, insane
[Bridge]
I don't know what to wear
I can't go over there
Well, let's talk afterwards
Somehow this strange love makes it easier
Just give me something, anything to live by
My blood is pumping so fast, I've forgotten why I try
[Refrain]
Sing to me
Woo
[Chorus]
Sing to me
You're so pretty
I'm a girl, I'm a ghost, I'm a gameshow
Nobody wants me
Fried over-easy
Say my name, name
Insane, insane
