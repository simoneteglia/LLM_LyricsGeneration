[Intro]
One, two, three
[Verse 1]
I remember the frozen sun
Take me back, take me back, take me
What a gift for the chosen one
Heart attack, no way back
Oh, the madness comes
I've got nowhere left that I can run
I could sleep for days
Left you how I found you, such a mysterious place
[Chorus]
So tell me something
Show me the world I'm searching for and take me home
I said just one thing
All that I could say before I'm gone
So tell me something
Show me the future with a difference, I can make it real enough
I'll take the suffering
I've got to know, I've got to know
[Verse 2]
Everything that I thought was lost
What a world, what a world, what a
One hit and I'm taking off
Find that girl, find that girl
Oh, call me insane
I just get excited by the change
Come the thirteenth day
Meet you for the first time and we've nothing left to say
[Chorus]
So tell me something
Show me the world I'm searching for and take me home
I said just one thing
All that I could say before I'm gone
So tell me something
Show me the future with a difference, I can make it real enough
I'll take the suffering
I've got to know, I've got to know
[Bridge]
If I imagined it all
Did nothing happen at all?
I was chosen to fall
Through time inside my mind
And I'm never gonna let you go
No matter how they try to find me
I'm just a man
I'm that child
At the expense of sanity
[Chorus]
So tell me something
Show me the world I'm searching for and take me home
I said just one thing
All that I could say before I'm gone
[Outro]
Three, two, one
