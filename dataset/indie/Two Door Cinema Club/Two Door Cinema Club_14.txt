[Verse 1]
Feel something right and feel something good
'Cause if one thing works, you might know it's true, it's true
[Chorus]
'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
And if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
[Verse 2]
One year, five days, we're starting new
Try to make a change, it's one more thing to do, to do
[Chorus]
'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
'Cause if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
And if this is the life, this is the life
This is the life, this is the life
This is the life, then who'd argue?
Then who'd argue?
