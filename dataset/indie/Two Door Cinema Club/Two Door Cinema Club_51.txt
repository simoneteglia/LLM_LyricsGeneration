[Verse 1]
Tip-tiptoes softly on the grass
But you won't find nothing there at all
And tip-tiptoes slowly on your hands
'Cause you can't walk out of this mess, no
Tip-tiptoes softly on the grass
But you won't find nothing there at all
And tip-tiptoes slowly on your hands
'Cause you can't walk
[Chorus]
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It's you
Too
[Verse 2]
You ask for someone to help you
But no one cares enough to look up
You can't ask for someone to help you
If you don't care enough to look around you
You ask for someone to help you
And no one care enough to look up
You can't ask for someone to help you
If no one cares
[Chorus]
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It's you
Too
[Bridge]
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
