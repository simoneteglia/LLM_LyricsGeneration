[Verse 1]
Is it a race or a chase?
It's a
difficult
one
You're running faster and further away
Or are you trying to keep up?
The sticks and stones have left you alone
And all your words will soon desert you
Are you waiting?
[Chorus]
There is no time for wasting any time
This is the end of the line
A definite sign of what we will be
Someday
Where do we start if we will end apart?
Where do we go from here?
It's head versus heart, it will all be clear
Someday
[Verse 2]
We hear that rumbling sound in the distance
It's coming closer, but we don't like to talk about it
The sticks and stones won't build you a home
And every word, it will exert you
'Til you're done
[Chorus]
There is no time for wasting any time
This is the end of the line
A definite sign of what we will be
Someday
Where do we start if we will end apart?
Where do we go from here?
It's head versus heart, it will all be clear
Someday
