Where would you go ?
Not long ago
I’ve been thinking out loud
Why so suddenly ?
Don’t you know ?
Don’t do it
What you do
Oh What you do to me
Forever is a long long time
When you’ve lost your way
Trying to follow your ideal
Oh sorry but your so called life
It is such a waste
Wear your real eyes
No you don’t realize
What you say yes to
But you say yes too
Where would you go
Where would you go
With a lasso ?
Could you run into
Could you run into
Could you go and run into me ?
Where would you go
Where would you go
Tied up to a lasso ?
Could you run into
Could you run into
Could you go and run into me ?
So lonely so pretty such a lack of diplomacy
You can’t get out
Don’t you know don’t do it
What you do well you should do to me
Far-out, so far-out
Such a fall-out
Not only that you’re lonely
Don’t matter if you’re not so well
No you’re not so well
Where would you go
Where would you go
With a lasso ?
Could you run into
Could you run into
Could you go and run into me ?
Where would you go
Where would you go
Tied up to a lasso ?
Could you run into
Could you run into
Could you go and run into me ?
Wear your real eyes
No you don’t realize
What you say yes to
But you say yes too
Forever is a long long time
When you’ve lost your way
Forever is a long long time
When you’ve lost your way
(When yiou've lost your way)
