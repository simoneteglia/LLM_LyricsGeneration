[Verse 1]
Lift the stone, it can't be left alone
If I hide underneath I give in
Turn the page and forgive all my rage
And my pride and belief, I can win
[Pre-Chorus]
All is good, all is great
And it's never too late
I will live to see another day
[Chorus]
The rising sun is sure to come
And I can hide, but I can't run
And fingertips on dried out lips
Reminding, too, that they are
One and the same
But go by many names
To answer each of them is not a choice
So live unknown
Until you find a home
Until you find a way to use your voice
All is good, all is great
And it's never too late
You will live to see another day
[Chorus]
Only running 'round in circles every time
And it won't end
Until they understand
And I've been waiting for that moment on the line
And it won't bend
So take me by the hand
[Chorus]
One and all that's passed
Will make it last
If you never find a way
To remember my name
