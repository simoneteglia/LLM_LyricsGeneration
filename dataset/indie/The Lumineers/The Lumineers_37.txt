[Verse 1: Wesley Schultz,
Jeremiah Fraites
]
Well, she was standing in a bar
I said, "Hello, how do you do?"
She handed me a
beer with a kangaroo
She spoke of places I had never been
That she had traveled to
And we slow danced alone to faster tunes
And I made her laugh, I made a pass
I showed her my half-dollar ring
She said, "That's pretty cool,"
But classy girls don't kiss in bars, you fool
(
No, they don't!
)
[Verse 2]
So, later on, the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if
Something drew me closer to her lips
So, picture my surprise when I had tried
To lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down
And I asked her why, and she replied
It was nothing I was doin' wrong
It's just what it is
No classy girls, don't kiss in bars like this
[Chorus]
No, classy girls don't kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts
But it's alright, the hardest part is through
[Outro]
Oh, through
Oh, through
Oh, through
The hardest part is through
