[Wesley Schultz]
I love you
And everything about you
Won't you stay away
So I can get my work done in the day, Okay
And maybe in the meantime
You and me will be fine
[Neyla Pekarek]
If you just relax
And check your eyes for cataracts
Its plain to see
That I was meant for you and you were meant for me
Darling hold me tightly
I think you and me we might be
Falling, Falling, Falling, I'm falling
[Both]
In love
[Wesley Keith Schultz]
Drama queen
Like when you see a fire
You grab the gasoline
Now honey please calm down
Yes don't make a scene
They're asking us to leave now
And calling the police now
[Neyla Pekarek]
Yes he's a manly man
Cause you're defending me just like a punching bag
But I can take a punch
If you can take a jab
[Wesley Keith Schultz]
And catch me when I fall
[Neyla Pekarek]
And dress your wounds with alcohol
I'm falling, falling, falling, I'm falling
[Both]
In love
