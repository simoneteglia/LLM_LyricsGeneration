[Verse 1]
Oh, the devil's inside
You opened the door, you gave him a ride
Too young to know, too old to admit
That you couldn't see how it ends
[Chorus]
What did you do to my eyes?
What did you sing to that lonely child?
Promised it all, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon
It's all or nothing to you
[Verse 2]
The glow of Hollywood signs
They sold you a bridge
They fed you the lines (they fed you to lions)
You always confused your servants for friends
But you couldn't see how it ends
It's all or nothing to you
[Chorus]
What did you do to my eyes?
What did you say to my only child?
Promised your love, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon
It's all or nothing to you
[Outro]
What did you do to my eyes?
What did you sing to that lonely child?
Promised it all, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon
