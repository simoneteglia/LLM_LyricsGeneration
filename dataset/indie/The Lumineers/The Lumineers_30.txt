[Verse 1]
As a kid, my hands were red
When you asked me I denied it
I've told lies that never came true
And I have stolen, so have you
[Pre-Chorus]
If we can make it through another day
With you believing in my innocence
And we can make it through another year
'Cause we both need it to forget this fear
[Chorus]
If it's all the same to you
Then it's just a little white lie
Then it's all the same to me
And it's just a little white lie
If I was to blame would you?
Would you still believe?
[Verse 2]
I don't want you to forget
Just pretend that it never happened
And it's just a little white lie
And it's just a little white lie
[Chorus]
If it's all the same to you
Then it's just a little white lie
Then it's all the same to me
And it's just a little white lie
If I was to blame would you?
Would you still believe?
[Outro]
If I was a thief?
