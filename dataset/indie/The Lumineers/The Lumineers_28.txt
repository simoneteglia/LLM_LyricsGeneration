[Intro]
I don't know why I just can't let it go
I don't know why I just can't let it go
Mm-mm-mm
Memory's old but I just can't let it go
The idea's gone but I just can't let it go
[Verse 1]
Time
Give me my yesterdays
Save it for all you had in your eyes
I have gone away
[Verse 2]
Fate dealt you a tricky hand
Now you're just left alone in your mind
And I have gone away
[Pre-Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm
I don't know why I just can't let it go
Memory's old but I just can't let it go
[Chorus]
In the light
Right here in the light
Right here in the–
Hold me and don't you ever let this die
Right here in the light
And in the day time
Right here in the–
Hold me and don't you ever let this die
[Outro]
In the light
And in the daytime
Right here in the–
