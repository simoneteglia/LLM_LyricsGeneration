[Verse 1]
They all need something to hold on to
They all mean well
Pay your respects to society giving me hell
[Chorus]
You could never feel my story
It's all you know
You could never feel my story
It's all you know
[Verse 2]
May your dreams come to reality
If all else fails
Give up, we needed the company
Let's drink to your health
[Chorus]
You could never feel my story
It's all you know
You could never feel my story
It's all you know
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, I will not fold
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, she's in control
Of everything
Of everything and everyone
[Instrumental]
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Outro]
Ooh
I will not fold
She's in control
I will not fold
No, never
I will not fold
She's in control
I will not fold
No, never
