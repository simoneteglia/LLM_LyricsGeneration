[Bridge]
Falling in love is wonderful
Falling in love is so alone
[Chorus]
My cell
My pretty little cell
[Post-Chorus]
Painted windows there for me
Painted windows so I can see
[Bridge]
Falling in love is wonderful
Falling in love is so alone
[Chorus]
My cell
My pretty little cell
[Post-Chorus]
Painted windows so I see
Painted windows are for me
[Chorus]
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
[Outro]
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
