Cozy up by the fire
Let all the air out
I'm not afraid, I'm on wire
That I'm connected to
That man he swallowed a sword
That man's scared, or he's not scared of the stage
That he's connected to
I'm connected too
And it burns
It burns
A man in line
A part, a little sound
Yeah, but here's the saddest part
I don't even care
Cozy up by the fire
Let all the air out
I'm not afraid, I'm on wire
That I'm connected to
And that man swallowed a sword
That man's scared, or he's not scared of the stage
That he's connected to
And I'm connected too
And it burns
It burns
A man in line
A part, a little sound
Yeah, but here's the saddest part
I don't even care
Yeah, but here's the saddest part
I don't even care
