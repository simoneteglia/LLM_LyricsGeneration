[Verse 1]
You go ahead
There's something I forgot
Walk slowly and I'll catch up
Let's hear the stars do their talking
I used to love caves
Stumble out into that big sky
Remember that bright, hollow moon?
Showed our insides on our outsides
[Chorus]
This town closes down the same time every day
Put out the smoke in your mind
Let's put all these words away
Let's put all these words away
[Verse 2]
Now I think I like birds
See 'em fly from St. Paul
And I go running when the night aches
I hear her every time shе calls
Did I hear something break?
Was that your hеart or my heart?
Like when the Earth shakes
Then the silence that follows
[Chorus]
This town closes down the same time every day
Put out the smoke in your mind
Let's put all these words away
Let's put all these words away
Let's put all these words away
Let's put all these words away
Let's put all these words away
