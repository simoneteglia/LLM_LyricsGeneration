[Verse 1]
When you left this town, with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align
[Pre-Chorus]
The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh, Angela, it's a long time coming
[Verse 2]
And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind
[Pre-Chorus]
From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
[Chorus]
Home at last
[Verse 3]
Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?
[Pre-Chorus]
Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away
[Chorus]
Home at last
Home at last
[Bridge]
Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knee, I belong, I believe
[Chorus]
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
[Outro]
Home at last
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
