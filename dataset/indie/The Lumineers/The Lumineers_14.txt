[Verse 1]
It's a lonely road, full of tired men
And you can see it in their faces
And you'll be home in spring, I can wait 'til then
I heard you're on the big train
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, this too shall pass
This loneliness won't last for long
[Chorus]
I wasn't there to take his place
I was ten thousand miles away
So when you hear my voice
When you say my name
May it never give you pain
But I don't wanna go, but it's time to leave
You'll be on my mind, my destiny
[Pre-Chorus]
And I won't fight in vain
I'll love you just the same, oh
[Chorus]
I couldn't know what's in your mind
But I saw the pictures, you're looking fine
And there was a time when I stood in line
For love, for love, for love
But I let you go, oh
I let you go
[Post-Chorus]
And he fell apart with his broken heart
And this blood, this blood, this blood
Oh, it drains from my skin, it does
