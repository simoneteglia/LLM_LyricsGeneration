[Verse 1]
I stood alone upon the platform in vain
The Puerto Ricans, they were playing their salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food
parking lots
I headed west, I was a man on the move
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh, I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust
And I don't gamble, but if I did I would bet on us
[Chorus]
Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I'm like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see, I was born to be
Be your Dead Sea
[Verse 2]
You told me you were good at runnin' away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
They took the rest when you took a nap
Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live it for yourself, you felt
You just felt it was time
And I'm glad, 'cause you with cats
That's just not right
[Chorus]
Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, I'm your Dead Sea
Woah, I'm like the Dead Sea
The nicest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see, I was born to be
Be your Dead Sea
[Bridge]
I've been down, I've been defeated
You're the message, I will heed it
Would you stay with me
Would you stay the night, ooh
[Chorus]
Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, I'm so Dead Sea
Woah, I'm like the Dead Sea
The nicest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see, I was born to be
Be your Dead Sea
