[Verse 1]
I didn't know I was the only thing you saw
Your eyes were blue
I don't know why I couldn't love myself
But you needed proof
[Pre-Chorus]
You and me, we'll always be the ones to hang around
I can see the loneliness you keep outside
[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's your birthday, dear
It's alright, it's alright, and we're carryin' on
And you know, and you know, and you know
It's your birthday
Every word, every word and we're singin' along
[Verse 2]
Over and over, I can only scream so loud
But you ignored me
You picked it up, you picked it up all apart
And now, there's nothing for me
[Pre-Chorus]
We gather 'round, your house burned down
As you held a garden hosе (Aah)
You and me, we'll always be thе ones to hang around
[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's your birthday, dear (Alright)
It's alright, it's okay, and we're carryin' on
And you know, and you know, and you know
It's your birthday (Ooh-oh)
Every word, every word and we're singin' along
[Bridge]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's your birthday, dear
It's alright, it's okay, and we're singin' along
[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's your birthday, dear (Alright)
It's alright, it's okay, and we're carryin' on (It's okay)
And you know, and you know, and you know
It's your birthday (Alright)
Every word, every word and we're singin' along
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's your birthday, dear (Alright)
It's alright, it's okay, and we're carryin' on (It's alright)
And you know, and you know, and you know
It's your birthday (Alright)
Every word, every word and we're singin' along
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's your birthday, dear (Alright)
It's alright, it's okay, and we're carryin' on (It's okay)
And you know, and you know, and you know
It's your birthday (Alright)
Every word, every word and we're singin' along
