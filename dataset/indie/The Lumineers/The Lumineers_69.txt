[Verse 1]
Loneliness oh won't you let me be
Let me be and I will set you free
Don't you think if it was up to me
I would choose to be happy
[Verse 2]
Let me go, say my goodbyes
There's no glory for me at the starting line
I was on my own in a search for the golden life
[Verse 3]
Oh I was leaving for the East horizon
And Joshua was on sea of diamonds
I left my home, it was not wrong for me to leave
I could not hold all of your promises to keep
[Verse 4]
And I was on my own in a broken boat, I cried
And what I'd give to know, is it me who's on your mind?
I left my love, it was not wrong for me to do
The slingshot fired it moved my words from me to you
[Verse 5]
So I'd been their Lord and Savior
They loved their trophies, but they hate the labor
The loneliest that I ever get
Is when I lose her voice inside the wind
