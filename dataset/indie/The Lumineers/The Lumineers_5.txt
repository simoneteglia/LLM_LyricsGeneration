[Verse 1]
She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you
The one you can't repair
But I still love her, I don't really care
[Pre-Chorus]
When we were young, oh-oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh-ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ah-ah, it can't be done
[Verse 2]
It's better to feel pain
Than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs
[Chorus]
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
[Verse 3]
And I don't blame you, dear
For runnin' like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
When we were young, oh-oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh-ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ah-ah, it can't be done
[Chorus]
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
[Outro]
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
