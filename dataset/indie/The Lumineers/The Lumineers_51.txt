[Intro]
Sittin' on a rollercoaster, holdin' on for dear life
Sittin' on a rollercoaster, holdin' on for dear life
[Chorus]
I know what is what
I know who you are
I know what is already gone
[Verse 1]
Making all the plans for later violated by
Everyone was able
Lord, they hate the other side
[Chorus]
I know what is what
I can feel the rust
I know you are already gone
[Post-Chorus]
Everyone was wrong
They were on the ledge
Everyone was only dyin' to live
[Verse 2]
I wish I could sail away and find another island
I wish we could start it over, have another child
[Chorus]
I know what is what
I can feel thе rust
I know what is already gone
[Post-Chorus]
Everyonе was wrong
I was on the ledge
Everyone was only flies in a web
[Outro]
They were always dying to know you
You could always see it in my eyes
Everyone was holding their breath, so cold
But I– I forgot
I– I forgot
