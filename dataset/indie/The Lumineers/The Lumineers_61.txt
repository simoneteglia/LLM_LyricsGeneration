[Verse 1]
Callin' on your neighborhood
Tell me who to like
Everyone's a friend
Every now and then
Tell me who to like
[Chorus]
I'm headed for the lights
I'm headed for the brightside, baby, tonight
Baby, tonight
[Verse 2]
Painted like a parasite
He's too young to die
Everyone's a friend
Every now and then
Way too young to die
[Chorus]
I'm headed for the lights
I'm headed for the brightside, baby, tonight
I'm headed for the lights
I'm headed for the brightside, baby, tonight
[Bridge]
Waitin' on the sun
I'm waitin' on the sun
I'm waitin' on the sun, tonight
Waitin' on the sun
I'm waitin' on the sun
I'm waitin' on the sun, tonight
[Chorus]
I'm headed for the lights
I'm headed for the brightside, baby, tonight
I'm headed for the lights (He's headed for the lights)
I'm headed for the brightside, baby, tonight
I'm headed for the lights (He's headed for the lights)
I'm headed for the brightside, baby, tonight
I'm headed for the lights (He's headed for the lights)
I'm headed for the brightside, baby, tonight
[Outro]
Photographs don't bring you back, no
Final chapter, ever after
