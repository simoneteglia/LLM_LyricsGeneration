[Verse 1]
Just wake up, I shouted
There's some blood, around the -
Clean it up, it's okay
Go get help, it's okay
I'm too young and now it's
It's gone numb around me
Ambulance in driveway
Speeding up the highway
[Pre-Chorus]
Suits were made for men, not boys
And this faith that we fake is a choice
[Chorus]
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
If it means goodbye
And I don't wanna see
I don't wanna be there
If it's the last time
[Verse 2]
Hold my brother's hand
And I'm his mother standing
In a sudden panic
Like a drugless addict
It's too late, the moment
When it runs you over
No one's safe, I need her
No one say it's over
[Pre-Chorus]
Suits were made for men, not boys
So leave me alone
And this faith that we fake is a choice
So take me
[Chorus]
I don't wanna go
And I don't wanna go
If it means goodbye
And I don't wanna go
I don't wanna see her
If it's the last time
