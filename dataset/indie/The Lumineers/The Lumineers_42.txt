[Verse 1: Wesley Schultz]
All the things you said to me
The manifest and destiny
Well, all of this could go away right now
[Pre-Chorus: Wesley Schultz]
And everyone was in the band
And I was on another planet
And you were all alone
[Chorus: Wesley Schultz,
James Felice & Simone Felice
]
And you wanna be a
big shot
You wanna be the
big man
You wanna hold a
big gun
You gotta have a
quick hand
You wanna be the
big shot
now
The chosen one your mother loved the most
After all
[Verse 2: Wesley Schultz]
Early morning, still in bed
You hate yourself for what you said
'Cause you could never admit you were wrong
[Pre-Chorus: Wesley Schultz]
And every song was out of key
And I was in the in-between
And you, still all alone
[Chorus: Wesley Schultz,
James & Simone
]
And you wanna be a
big shot
You wanna be the
big man
You wanna place a
big bet
You better have a
big hand
You wanna be the
big shot
You wanna be the
only son we love
After all
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus: Wesley Schultz,
James & Simone
]
And you wanna be a
big shot
You wanna be the
big man
You wanna hold a big gun
(Big gun)
You better have a quick hand
(Quick hand)
You wanna be the big shot
(The big shot)
You wanna be the big man
(Big man)
You wanna place a big bet
(Big bet)
You better have a sick hand
(Sick hand)
[Outro: Wesley Schultz,
James & Simone
]
You wanna be the
big shot now
Big shot now
After all
