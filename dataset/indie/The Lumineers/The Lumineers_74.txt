[Verse 1]
There are scenes that I will always see
I can never be blind
There are pages, precious pages
Pretty pictures in my mind
[Verse 2]
There are things that I remember
Locked away for other times
I will bring out on a down day
Pretty pictures in my mind
[Verse 3]
I will re-run love and laughter
From the vaults locked back behind
On an ugly day, I will do it
Pretty pictures in my mind
[Bridge]
Lo and behold
A dark room is where I sit alone
The lights turn red
The chemicals form the images
I can see it now
[Verse 4]
Oh, yes, I will be a dreamer
There are so few of my kind
Where the treasure trove of beauty
Pretty pictures in my mind
