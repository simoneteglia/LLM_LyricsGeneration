Deck the halls with boughs of holly
'Tis the season to be jolly
Don we now our gay apparel
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol
See the blazing Yules before us (ooo, ooo, ooo)
Strike the harp and join the chorus (ooo, ooo, ooo)
Follow me in merry measure (ooo, ooo)
While I tell of Yule-tide treasure (ooo, ooo, ooo)
Fast away the old year passes (ooo, ooo, ooo)
Hail the new year, lads and lasses (ooo, ooo, ooo)
Sing we joyous, all together (ooo, ooo, ooo)
Heedless of the wind and weather (ooo, ooo, ooo)
Deck the halls with boughs of holly (ooo, ooo)
'Tis the season to be jolly
