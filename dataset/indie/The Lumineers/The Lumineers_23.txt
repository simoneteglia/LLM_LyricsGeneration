[Verse 1]
Some days are diamonds
Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden
And they fade away
But if I never do nothing
I'll get you back someday
[Chorus]
’Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
[Verse 2]
All around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the danger
It holds in the pain
Sometimes you’re happy
Sometimes you cry
Half of me is ocean
Half of me is sky
[Chorus]
But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Yes, they do
[Bridge]
Some things are over
Some things go on
Part of me you carry
And part of me is gone
[Outro]
But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Baby, you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
