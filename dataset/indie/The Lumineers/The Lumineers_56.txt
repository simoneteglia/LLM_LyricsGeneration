[Verse 1]
If you're down on your luck don't get down on yourself it won't do you no good
'Cause I've been there before, fought 100 wars, but I'm still fighting for you
[Chorus]
Elouise, why'd you leave
Please confess, confess to me
Sing my song, patiently
And I'll return, my Elouise
[Verse 2]
Let's be Elvis and let's be David Byrne, let's all learn how to dance
Move your feet in time, put your hand in mine, we will waltz once again
[Chorus]
Elouise, why'd you leave
Please confess, confess to me
Sing my song, patiently
And I'll return, my Elouise
[Chorus Louder]
Elouise, why'd you leave
Please confess, confess to me
Sing my song, graciously
We will waltz, Elouise
