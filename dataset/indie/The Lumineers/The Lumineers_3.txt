[Intro]
Ho
Hey
Ho
Hey
Ho
[Verse 1]
I've been tryin' to do it right (Hey)
I've been livin' a lonely life (Ho)
I've been sleepin' here instead (Hey)
I've been sleepin' in my bed (Ho)
Sleepin' in my bed (Hey Ho Ho)
[Verse 2]
So show me family (Hey)
All the blood that I will bleed (Ho)
I don't know where I belong (Hey)
I don't know where I went wrong (Ho)
But I can write a song (Hey)
[Chorus]
(Two, three)
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet
[Post-Chorus]
Ho
Hey (Come on, now)
Ho
Hey, hey (Woo)
Ho
[Verse 3]
I don't think you're right for him (Hey)
Think of what it might have been if we (Ho)
Took a bus to Chinatown (Hey)
I'd be standin' on Canal (Ho)
And Bowery (Hey Ho)
She'd be standin' next to me (Hey)
[Chorus]
(Two, three)
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
[Bridge]
Love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
'Cause oh, we're bleedin' out
[Chorus]
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet
[Outro]
Ho
Hey
Ho (Last one)
Hey
