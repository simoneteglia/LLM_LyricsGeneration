[Verse 1]
Standin' on the corner, I could listen to the radio
When the savior sang from the fire escape on the second floor
You were always sayin' we would make it to the catacombs
In the end, it came when you wrote my name on the bathroom stall
[Bridge]
If the photograph doesn't bring you back
If the final chapter isn't ever after
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
I remember wakin' up the neighbor like a stadium
Yeah, he ran upstairs screamin' no one cared
And thе band played on
Even in the limo you wеre feelin' like an animal
At the traffic light, where you blew your mind on a mobile phone
[Pre-Chorus]
Day and night, my love
You said the blood was on my hands
[Chorus]
Long as you run
I couldn't give you up
Forever run
I couldn't give you up
[Bridge]
In the minivan with your headphones in
Did you write your letters to your shitty friends?
And all this time, you said to me, “My love would never die”
[Chorus]
Long as you run
I couldn't give you up
Forever run
I couldn't give you up (And the daylight in my eyes)
Long as you run (And the silence on the street)
I couldn't give you up (And the low light in my head)
Forever run (And I was incomplete)
I couldn't give you up (And the daylight in my eyes)
Long as you run (And the silence on the street)
I couldn't give you up (And the low light in my head)
Gone, no goodbye (And I was incomplete)
I couldn't give you up
