[Verse 1]
On the last time we met
Your love was dead
You held my hand
Bit your tongue
Shut me out
Spilled my blood
All around
[Chorus]
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I took the poison, praying you'd feel it too
You held your punches back and I left the room
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
[Verse 2]
All alone
You always felt
We dragged you down
Gave me hell
Made your bed
Now you sleep
On your own
Guess we'll see
[Chorus]
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I took the poison, praying you'd feel it too
You held your punches back and I left the room
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
[Bridge]
I know that you tried
But you're no friend of mine
Falling apart
You played it the best
A dame in distress, ooh
[Chorus]
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I wrapped my neck and prayed that you'd feel the noose
I saw the restaurant table for two
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I took the poison, praying you'd feel it too
You held your punches back and I left the room
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
