[Verse 1]
I feel her filth in my bones
Wash off my hands 'til it's gone
The walls, they're closin' in
With velvet curtains
[Verse 2]
Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel
[Verse 3]
They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn, I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo
[Chorus]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
[Verse 4]
Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight
[Chorus]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
[Verse 5]
And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you
[Verse 6]
I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on
[Outro]
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
Don't you frown when you're feelin' like that
Only love can dig you out of this
