[Verse 1]
You're gonna leave, it ain't gonna break my heart, mama
I've never seen nobody quite like you
[Chorus]
And if you ever change your tune
Oh, the world's got the best of you
You can always find me where the skies are blue
[Verse 2]
Wanted to change, turn into what you love, mama
And I woulda gave all of my best to you
[Chorus]
So, if you ever need a fool
Who will give you a love so true
You can always find me where the skies are blue
[Bridge]
Lay your dreams, little darlin', in a flower bed
Let that sunshine in your hair, in your hair
[Verse 3]
You're gonna bleed somebody's brand new love, mama
Who's gonna feel just like it always do
[Chorus]
And when your fairytale is through
And you're looking for someone new
You can always find me where the skies are blue
You can always find me where the skies are blue
