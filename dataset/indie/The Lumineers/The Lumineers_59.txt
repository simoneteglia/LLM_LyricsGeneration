[Verse 1]
And the ocean was all in my fingertips
But I held you on my back
And the foam of the sea was an awful white
But beyond it painted black
[Bridge]
Waitin' on the sun
I'm waitin' on the sun
I'm waitin' on the sun tonight
[Verse 2]
I awoke from the sleep of a hundred days
To the fire station bells
And the smell of the smoke brought me back in time
When my father killed the cold
[Refrain]
Hey, Mr. Remington, promise us everything
Please, Mr. Remington, now
Hey, Mr. Remington, promise us everything
Pl–µase, Mr. Remington, now
