[Verse]
He whispers secrets through a thick mustache
And she listens to him
Flicks her cigarette's ash
And smoke hangs velvet curtains
And hides her lips
And she hopes to hell it's worth all her health risks
[Pre-Chorus]
I know it was you
I know it was you
[Chorus]
'Cause everyone requires a plan
I can give you
It's all been a sleight of hand
[Outro]
I know it was you
I know it was you
