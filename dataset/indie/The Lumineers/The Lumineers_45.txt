[Verse 1]
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear, if you're not here with me
[Verse 2]
I'll have a blue heartache for certain
And when those blue memories starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
[Verse 3]
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
I'll have a blue memory for certain
And you'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
