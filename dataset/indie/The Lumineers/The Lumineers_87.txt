[Verse 1]
Well, she was standing in a bar
I said, "Hello, how do you do?"
She handed me a beer with a kangaroo
She spoke of places I had never been
That she had traveled to
And we slow danced alone to faster tunes
And I made her laugh, I made a pass
I showed her my half-dollar ring
She said, "That’s pretty cool"
But classy girls don’t kiss in bars, you fool
[Verse 2]
So, later on, the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if something drew me closer to her lips
So, picture my surprise when I had tried to lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down quick
I asked her why, and she replied
It was nothing I was doing wrong, it’s just what it is
But classy girls, don’t kiss in bars like this
[Chorus]
No, classy girls don’t kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts
But it’s all right, the hardest part is through
[Outro]
Oh, through
Oh, through
Oh, through
The hardest part is through
