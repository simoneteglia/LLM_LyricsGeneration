[Verse 1]
Twisty sidewalks, female taxi drivers
Dirty fingers, pink houses light up
[Chorus]
And if there's just one thing
You wanted to see
I suggest you keep looking
Find out for once
Find out for once
Find out for once
[Verse 2]
Count the bikes, Strange violin
Barter price, smoking inside
Stray cat walks, broken English
Chairman's eye, living billions
[Chorus]
And if there's just one thing
You wanted to see
I suggest you keep looking
Find out for once
Find out for once
Find out for once
