[Verse 1]
"Show me how you do that trick
That one that makes me scream," she said
"The one that makes me laugh," she said
Threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it
And I'll promise you, I'll promise you I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you
[Verse 2]
Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways I had
To make her glow
"Why are you so far away?" she said
Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
That I'm in love with you?
[Chorus]
You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepеst oceans
Twisting in the water
You'rе just like a dream
You're just like a dream
[Verse 3]
Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
Found myself alone, alone
Alone above the raging sea
Stole the only girl I love
And drowned her deep inside of me
[Chorus]
You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
You're just like heaven
