[Verse 1]
It's not the words you say, but how you say it
I saved a picture where your hair was braided
They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary
[Chorus]
You hate the name Junior
Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children
[Verse 2]
If you don't have it, then you'll never give it
And I don't blame you for the way you livin'
The little boy was born in February
You couldn't sober up to hold a baby
[Chorus]
You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry
[Bridge]
Hold my hand now, time to
Go to bed, it's way too late
[Chorus]
You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry
We raised a saint daughter
You love to judge strangers' karma
You're praying for a funeral
You sang it like Hallelujah
[Outro]
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
