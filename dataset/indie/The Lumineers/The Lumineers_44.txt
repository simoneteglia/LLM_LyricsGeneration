[Verse 1]
I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around
[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
[Verse 2]
And the church discouraged, any lust that burned in me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held out
When a man's rejected, but he can fight for your affection
And he can act like he never met you and leave low to the ground
[Chorus]
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
[Verse 3]
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you
But it's all a daydream, but it's you who's behind me
But you never recognize me, it brings me to you
[Bridge]
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part
[Verse 4]
And there are nights I wake up, to the sound of a door shut
And I search on the floors but I find no tracks
And the nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end
[Outro]
I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time
