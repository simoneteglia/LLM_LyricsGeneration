An old lady crosses the street
And as she waves to me, I don't see her
And I know that one day I
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And how I miss my mother's mother
She became a stranger, but I still love her
And I hope, I hope she returns
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now the day came when we left her
We couldn't say goodbye, and I know that I was wrong
But I hope that she knows
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
