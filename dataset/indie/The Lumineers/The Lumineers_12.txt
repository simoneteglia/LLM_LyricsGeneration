[Intro]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
[Verse 1]
And if the city's skyscrapers rise over this island
Would you be glad to see Manhattan for once?
I knew the dream, it died, JMZ line, Myrtle, and Broadway
But I'd be glad to see Manhattan for once
[Chorus]
Woah-woah, living life in the city
Woah-woah, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Woah-woah, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah (Two, three, four)
[Post-Chorus]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
[Verse 2]
And if you leave, don't leave me all alone
'Cause I'll be scared, I'll be naked, I'll get cold
And I miss my dad and
Cleopatra
sitting on a phone
So take me back off these streets and we'll never be apart
Together from the start
Never, never falling back alone
[Chorus]
Living life in the city
Oh-oh, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Oh-oh, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah
[Bridge]
And if the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you just lay down and dig your grave?
Or will you rail against your dying day?
[Outro]
Da-da-da-da, da, da, da-ah-da
Da-da-da-da-ah, da, da, da
Da-da-da-da, da, da, da-ah-da
Da-da-da-da-ah, da, da, da
