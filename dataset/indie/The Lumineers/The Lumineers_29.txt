[Chorus 1]
Lovely girl, won't you stay
Won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl, won't you stay
Won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see
[Verse 1]
Fleet of black, fleet of black limousines
All tinted machines, here comes the cavalcade
With the armored cars, armored cars like Berettas
Flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe, keep me safe
[Chorus 2]
And oh my my, oh hey hey
Here he comes, the candidate
Blue eyed boy, United States
Vote for him, the candidate
[Verse 2]
Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the carats
Plaster of Paris, the floats fill up the street
And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry, pageantry
[Chorus 3]
And oh my my, oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade
[Bridge]
Oh-oh
[Verse 3]
Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it's the third round
Oh, when Louie will go down
If he don't, there's hell to pay and hell to raise
[Chorus 4]
And oh my my, oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight
[Verse 4]
Catholic priest, Catholic priest in a crisis
Torn between romance and Jesus
Who will win the civil war?
And he says, "I'm in love, I'm in love with a woman
Yeah, this is my confession
I'm leaving, I can't be a priest anymore, anymore"
[Chorus 5]
And oh my, oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith
Left the church for a fiancee
Let him love, the man of faith
[Bridge]
Oh-oh
[Verse 5]
TV cameras, TV cameras and stage hands
American Bandstand, electric guitars
And he's singin' songs, singin' songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys
They know all his words by heart, by heart and they all sing
[Chorus 1]
Lovely girl, won't you stay
Won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl, won't you stay
Won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl, won't you stay
[Chorus 6]
Oh my my, oh hey hey
Here she comes, by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
She's arrived, my saving grace
