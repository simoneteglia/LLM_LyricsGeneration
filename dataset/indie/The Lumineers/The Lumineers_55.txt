[Verse 1]
Eighteen in love, all in a night
Felt it coming home, bathe in a light
For awhile, for awhile, for awhile
[Verse 2]
Came in like a thief, lost and afraid
With your head in hand, sworn enemies
Was it I? Was it I? Was it i?
[Chorus]
It's alright, Isabelle
It's alright
I know only one way to fly
I know there's everyone and I
[Bridge]
And the weight we hold
Is it all you know?
Can we make it out alive?
[Chorus]
It's alright, Isabelle
It's alright
I know there's only one way to fly
I know there's everyone and I
[Outro]
I, I, I
