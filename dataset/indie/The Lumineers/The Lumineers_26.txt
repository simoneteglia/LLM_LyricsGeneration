[Verse 1]
Charlie boy, don't go to war
First born in '44
And Kennedy made him believe
We could do much more
[Interlude]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
[Verse 2]
And Lillian, don't hang your head
Love should make you feel good
In uniform, you raised a man
Who volunteered to stand
[Interlude]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
[Chorus]
Play the bugle, play the taps (and)
Make your mothers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky, boys
Fire that volley loud
[Verse 3]
The news was bad on Upland Ave
Metuchen, mourn our loss
And sons rebelled, while fathers yelled
And mothers clutched the cross
[Interlude]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
[Chorus]
Play the bugle, play the taps (and)
Make your fathers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky, boys
Fire that volley loud
