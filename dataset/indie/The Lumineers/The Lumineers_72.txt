[Verse 1]
Things can get so bad I know
But things could always be worse
There's a blessing tucked inside of each and every curse
You could be a selfish fool
And somehow not be selfish enough
Your glass could be half full
But you have already drank way too much
[Chorus]
This is life, this is life, Merry Christmas
This is life, this is life
[Verse 2]
Oh, how humor
You burst the bubble of all our hidden pain
Oh, how humor
You clever mother, you're keeping everybody sane
Oh, how laughter
You make us bastards feel some kind of joy
Like a golden token
We find we're not broken, like some cheap little toy
[Chorus]
This is life, this is life, Merry Christmas
This is life, this is life, Merry Christmas
[Verse 3]
Time is so fleeting
I hope that you're reading everything in between the lines
Life can have meaning
If you keep dreaming all the way through the days and the nights
I saw you cry a little, in the middle of a story you once told
You're a thing of beauty, and we're all rooting for you not to fold
[Chorus}
This is life, this is life, Merry Christmas
This is life, this is life, Merry Christmas
[Outro]
This is life, this is life, Merry Christmas
This is life, this is life, Merry Christmas
