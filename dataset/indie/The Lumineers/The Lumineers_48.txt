[Chorus]
Love was not designed for time
You were never really mine
[Verse 1]
Find a love, I was leveled at the sight of you
You were wrong, what I needed was a little clue
All alone in the middle of the night
Give it, give it up just to leave it on the line
[Chorus]
Love was not designed for time
You were never really mine
[Verse 3]
All alone at the traffic stop light, I
Livе at home 'cause I nevеr knew the right time
Everyone's gonna leave it where you left
You're a woman on the run, I'm the silence on the staircase
[Chorus]
Love was not designed for time
You were never really mine
Love was not designed for time
You were never really mine
[Bridge]
Hey, don't you fade, don't you fade away
Hey, don't you fade, don't you fade away
Hey, don't you fade, don't you fade away
Hey, don't you fade, don't you fade away
Hey, don't you fade, don't you fade away
Hey, don't you fade, don't you fade, don't you fade
[Verse 4]
Say it once so the neighbors all can hear you
I'm the one who was never gonna play to lose
All of a sudden you're fallin' out of frame
I was lookin' through the camera, you're lookin' for a way out
[Chorus]
Love was not designed for time
You were never really mine
Love was not designed for time
You were never really mine
[Outro]
Never really mine
You were never really mine
