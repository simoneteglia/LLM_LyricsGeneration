[Verse 1]
What time was it when you were only 18 years old?
You crossed the street, you crossed your legs
You came across a little cold
And it was all, it was all falling apart (Falling apart)
[Verse 2]
What time, what time was it
When you were in the eighth grade?
You brought the box up to the high school
You spiked the Gatorade
And it was all for, for a weekend
It was all, all still falling apart
[Chorus]
I didn't say you'd be better off if you quit
Everyone left 'cause you held on longer than the rest
What made you leave? And when you did, you left for Denver
Why? What did you know that I did not?
That I did not?
[Verse 3]
Oh, is it one, or is it two, or is it three kids now?
They mark the time, they draw the lines around your eyelids now
And is it all still for the weekend?
Is it all, all still falling apart?
[Chorus]
I didn't say you'd be better off if you quit
Everyone left 'cause you held on longer than the rest
What made you leave? And when you did, you left for Denver
Why? What did you know that I did not?
That I did not?
