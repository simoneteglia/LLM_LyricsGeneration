[Verse 1]
I believe submarines
Underneath deep blue sea
Saw the flags, Japanese
No one will believe me
[Hook 1]
Ran back to the town bar and
I told the people how
I had seen a submarine
And everyone laughed aloud
[Verse 2]
I did spy a periscope
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes
Told me I'd seen a ghost
[Hook 2]
Everyone thinks I'm a liar
No one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire
I would be on the roof
[Verse 3]
Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay
(Let me go)
No one trusts what I say (I don't know)
Oh my God, no one paid (attention)
Overnight, my hair turned gray
(Oh, oh, oh)
[Hook 3]
In the end, it boils down
To credibility
I had none, so I will die
With the secrets of the sea
[Outro]
(Submarine)
(Can't find me)
Submarine
(Submarine)
