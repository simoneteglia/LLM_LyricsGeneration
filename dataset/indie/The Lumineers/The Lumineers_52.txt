[Chorus]
Well, I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
[Verse 1]
Well I found myself a place
Every smile that you waste
And every other careless look you’ve ever tossed aside
Well in my heart I know it’s true
That I can’t go on loving you
And that’s the truth it don’t feel good, but honey it feels right
[Chorus]
Cause I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
[Verse 2]
Well of love I’ve had my share I’ve got plenty of people really who care
At times I might get wicked in my pride
But I smoke that mountain air honey I’ve been here, and I’ve been there
At times I might get lonely honey I don’t cry
[Chorus]
Cause I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
[Verse 3]
There’s times at night when it’s cold outside, the moon don’t shine, the winds are crying
I wonder if you’re at home you might let me back inside
We can huddle up by the old stove we can kindle up some burned out coals
We can love our selves like the days are warm
Said, No no no no no
[Chorus]
Cause I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
[Chorus Louder]
Well, I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
