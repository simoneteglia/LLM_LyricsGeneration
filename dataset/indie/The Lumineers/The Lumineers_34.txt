[Verse 1]
Some of us love to think of life as a game
Others are born into royalty and can never behave
Some find a freedom locking men in a cage, oh no
Some priest insisted it's a test of the faith
And only holy devotion can keep the devils away
There's only so much that a man can pray, oh no
[Refrain]
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Spare my blood
Spare my blood
[Verse 2]
I saw the footprints in the white of the snow
I counted thousands and I was just a rider alone
Eighteen degrees and eighty miles from home, oh no
We built a wall to keep the devils at bay
A distant army was marching through the night and the day
I swore an oath and with my life I would pay, oh no
[Refrain]
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Spare my blood
[Chorus]
Nightshade, won't you take me away?
And I can hold my breath for another day
But it was all, it was all for the throne
[Verse 3]
We were surrounded and the ending was near
All of the sudden, a ranger arrived, a savior appeared
Made it to safety, but the devil was here, oh no
[Chorus]
Oh, my love
Nightshade, won't you take me away?
And I can hold my breath for another day
But it was all, it was all for the throne
