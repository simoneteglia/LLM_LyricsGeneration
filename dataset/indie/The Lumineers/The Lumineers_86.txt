[Verse 1]
I could see it in the air
Every word was like smoke from a cigarette
You were blowin' in your hands
The heater broke in the Oldsmobile
And the light in your eyes
Alone on the freeway
[Verse 2]
I was stranded in the bed
You were listening to The Dark Side of the Moon
I could barely see your eyes
Psilocybin in a hotel room
[Pre-Chorus]
And the light in your eyes
The waves on the ceiling
[Chorus]
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
Tonight
[Verse 3]
You were tired of Tacoma
I was tired of believing we were right
Losing every other friend
Finding nothing in the afterlife
[Pre-Chorus]
But the light in your eyes
Alone on a feeling
[Chorus]
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
Tonight
[Post-Chorus]
You're stranded on the bridge
You're crying for your kids
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
Tonight
Tonight
[Verse 4]
I could see it in the air
Every word was like smoke from a cigarette
Sun is coming up ahead
Get your crack in the windshield shine
[Pre-Chorus]
And the light in your eyes
Alone on the freeway
[Chorus]
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
Tonight
[Post-Chorus]
You're stranded it on the bridge
The cops are closing in
I'll be your brightside, baby, tonight
Tonight
Tonight
