Falling in love is wonderful
Falling in love is so alone
My cell
My pretty little cell
Painted windows there for me
Painted windows so I can see
Falling in love is wonderful
Falling in love is so alone
My cell
My pretty little cell
Painted windows so I see
Painted windows are for me
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
