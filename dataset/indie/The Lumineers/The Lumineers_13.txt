Every night, I saw you there
In your old wicker chair
Singing, ooh
You were wrong, I was right
Didn't matter in a fight
Singing, ooh
Coffee mug, filled it up
Always knew what it was
Singing, ooh
Been on your side for years
You could never love without crying
Ooh
Is she dead? Is she fine?
Every day, every night
Fate has dealt me a lonely blow
I said, ooh
Tried to help, but only hurt
In the end, I made it worse
Singing, ooh
Is she dead? Is she fine?
Every day, every night
Give back my keys, give back my chair
Take back those clothes you always left on the floor
You drove me wild, drove me insane
Drank the whole bottle and forgot my name
All I ever wanted was a mother for the first time
Finally, I can see you as the leader of the landslide
She left, she left, the writing's on the wall
Please believe me, I smell the alcohol
The only thing I know is that we're in too deep
And maybe when she's dead and gone, I'll get some sleep
You blamed it all on your kids
We were young, we were innocent
You told me a lie, fuck you for that
Fuck all your pride and fuck all your prayers
And all this time, I waited like a fool, and for the first time
Finally, I can see you as the leader of the landslide
She left, she left, the writing's on the wall
Please believe me, don't answer when she calls
The only thing I know is that we're in too deep
And maybe when she's dead and gone, I'll get some sleep
Out there on my own, I was feeling so alone
Like a poltergeist in the afterlife
Fading by degrees
, I was shaking in the knees
In the aftermath of this broken glass
Oh, oh, oh
