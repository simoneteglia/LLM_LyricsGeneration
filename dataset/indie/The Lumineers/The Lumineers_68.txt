[Chorus]
Pretty paper
Pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents
To your darling from you
Pretty pencils write I love you
Pretty papers
Pretty ribbons of blue
Oh pretty papers
Pretty ribbons of blue
[Verse]
Crowded street, busy feet hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, christmas is nigh'
There he sits, alone on the sidewalk
Just hopin' that you all pass him by
Should you stop, better not, much too busy
You're in a hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance, the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of laughter he cried
[Chorus]
Of Pretty paper
Pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents your darling from you
Pretty pencils write I love you
Pretty papers
Pretty ribbons of blue
Oh Pretty paper
Pretty ribbons of blue
