[Verse 1]
Ah, ah, when I was younger
I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back
[Verse 2]
I, I got a new girlfriend here
Feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness
[Chorus]
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
[Verse 3]
I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move (Whoo!)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small
[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I love you
That's all she wrote
[Chorus]
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophеlia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophеlia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
