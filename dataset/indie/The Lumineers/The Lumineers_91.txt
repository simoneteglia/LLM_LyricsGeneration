[Verse 1]
Held on to hope like a noose, like a rope
God and medicine take no mercy on him
Poisoned his blood, and burned out his throat
Enough is enough, he's a long way from home
[Verse 2]
Days of my youth wasted on a selfish fool
Who ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt
I flew far away, as far as I could go
Your time is running out
And I'm a long way from home
[Verse 3]
Laid up in bed, you were laid up in bed
Holding the pain like you're holding your breath
I prayed you could sleep, sleep like a stone
You're right next to me
But you're a long way from home
[Verse 4]
Hospital gowns nevеr fit like they should
We yеlled at the nurse, didn't do any good
More morphine, the last words you moaned
At last I was sure
That you weren't far away from home
