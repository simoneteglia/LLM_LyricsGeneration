[Verse 1]
Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
And I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
And I know, shinin' down like water
[Chorus]
And I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
And I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
[Verse 2]
Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
And I know, it's been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
And I know, it can't stop, I wonder
[Chorus]
And I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
Yeah, comin' down on a sunny day
