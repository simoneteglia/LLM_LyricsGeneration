The Lumineers new album “III” was released on Friday the 13th. The title was not only a note saying that this was their untitled third album, it was actually referring to three characters two of the lead singers made up. The album consisted of 13 tracks, (10 with 3 bonus tracks), and personally I thought it was really good. The ten main tracks on the album were released in three single compilations in the couple of months before the album’s official release, discussing three characters in the “Sparks” family. This family is loosely based upon the family of the two lead singers (they are brothers). The album tackles intense topics such as love, pain, and addiction, and overall, I think the concept and the songs themselves on this album were all very good
