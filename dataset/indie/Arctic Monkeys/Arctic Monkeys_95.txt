[Verse 1]
I wanna build you up
Brick by brick
I wanna break you down
Brick by brick
Iâ€™m gonna reconstruct
Brick by brick
I wanna feel your love
[Chorus]
Brick by brick, aaaaah
Brick by brick, aaaaah
[Verse 2]
I wanna steal your soul
Brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll
Brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll
Brick by brick
I wanna rock and roll
[Chorus]
Brick by brick, aaaaah
Brick by brick, aaaaah
[Verse 3]
I wanna brick by brick
Brick by brick
I wanna blow by blow
Brick by brick
I want an empty soul
Brick by brick
I wanna brick by brick by brick by...
[Chorus]
Brick by brick, aaaaah
Brick by brick, aaaaah
