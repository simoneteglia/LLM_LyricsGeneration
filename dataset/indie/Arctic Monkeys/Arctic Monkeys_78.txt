[Verse 1]
Jet skis on the moat
They shot it all in CinemaScope
As though it's the last time you're gonna ride
Showstoppers anonymous
Come over here and give your buddy a hug
So much for decidin' not to let it slide
[Chorus]
Is there somethin' on your mind
Or are you just happy to sit there and watch while the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know
[Verse 2]
Lights out on the Wonder Park
Your saw-toothed lover boy was quick off the mark
That's long enough in the sunshine for one night
Didn't recognise you through thе smoke
Pyjama pants and a
Subbuteo cloak
You know that it's alright if you wanna cry
[Chorus]
Is therе somethin' on your mind
Or are you just happy to sit there and watch while the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know
[Outro]
Jet skis on the moat
They shot it all in CinemaScope
As though, it's the last time you're gonna ride
