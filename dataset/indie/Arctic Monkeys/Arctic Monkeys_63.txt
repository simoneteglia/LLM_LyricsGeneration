[Verse 1]
You got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows
Catty eyelashes
And your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple-A passes
At the cemetery gates
[Chorus]
'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
[Refrain]
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark
[Verse 2]
And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque
You watch Italian horror
And you listen to the scores
Leather-cladded, spike collared
I want you down on all fours
[Chorus]
'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
[Bridge]
I know you're nothing like mine
'Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love would tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
'Cause I don't shun the daylight
But, baby, I'm willing to start
[Refrain]
You're so dark
[Verse 3]
Got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allen Poe
Got your unkind of ravens
Got your murder of crows
[Chorus]
You're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark, oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
