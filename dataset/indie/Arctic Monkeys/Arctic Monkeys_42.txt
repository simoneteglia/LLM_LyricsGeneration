[Verse 1]
Mad sounds in your ears
Make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
[Chorus]
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance, they make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up
[Verse 2]
Love buckles under the strain
Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
[Chorus]
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance, they make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up
[Bridge]
Suppose you've gotta do what you've gotta do
We just weren't feelin' how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere, somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
[Chorus]
You got those mad sounds in your ears
To make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears
They make you get up and dance
Oh, don't they make you get up
Ah yeah, they make you get up
[Outro]
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
