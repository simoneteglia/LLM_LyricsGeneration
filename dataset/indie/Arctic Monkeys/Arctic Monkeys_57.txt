[Verse 1]
Break a mirror, roll the dice
Run with scissors
through a
chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair
[Verse 2]
Find a well-known hard man and start a fight
Wear your shell suit on bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair
[Chorus]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes
Kung fu fighting on your roller skates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair
[Chorus]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh
