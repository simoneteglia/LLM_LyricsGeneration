[Verse 1]
Blind faith, heartache
Mind games, mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole
[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all
[Verse 2]
Old dogs, new tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all
[Bridge]
And then suddenly it hit me, it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke
Said, ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?
Leave me listening to the Stones' "2000 Light Years from Home"
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop, shoo-wop
[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
