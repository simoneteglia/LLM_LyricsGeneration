[Verse 1]
Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown
In my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke
And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough
[Chorus]
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves
[Verse 2]
All my own stunts,
high noon has changed its tune
Linking arms,
sinking hearts
And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize
[Chorus]
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro: "I'm From High Green" snippet]
I'm from High Green
I'm from High Green
