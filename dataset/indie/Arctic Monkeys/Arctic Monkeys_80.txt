[Spoken Intro]
[Verse 1]
Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm strugglin'
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact
That everybody's eatin' out of your hands
[Chorus]
But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothin'
Yeah, but I'd still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said, you don't know nothin'
[Verse 2]
Well, fancy seein' you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it
Yeah, and you knew it all along
Oh, and you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong
[Chorus]
So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothin'
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothin', no
[Bridge]
Oh-woah, woah, woah
Oh-woah, woah, woah
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Oh-woah, woah, woah
[Chorus]
Oh, so what do you know?
Yeah, you don't know nothin', no
Yeah, but I'd still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
I said, what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothin'
[Verse 3]
I fancy you with a passion
Oh, you're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But you're a fad and you're a fashion
And I'm havin' a job tryin' to talk to you
But it's alright
Yeah, I'll put it on one side
Oh, 'cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes, includin' mine
