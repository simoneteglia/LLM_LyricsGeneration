[Verse 1]
The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns
Am I too quick to assume that the love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune
To what they did before,
her head's red raw
And the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before
It felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more
[Chorus 1]
And there would be, oh, it's uncertain
Whether the curtain has shut for good
She said, "See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it"
And, "If you loved meâ€“"
And I interrupted, received a scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there
[Verse 2]
Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging?
Docked in tempestuous bays
Or at least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier
And whether you're asleep or awake
[Chorus 2]
Is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me
As Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
It's a pity
It just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back
