[Intro:
Josh Homme
]
One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh
[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside
[Chorus: Alex Turner &
Josh Homme
]
One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
[Chorus: Alex Turner &
Josh Homme
]
One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
[Bridge: Alex Turner &
Josh Homme
]
The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
[Guitar Solo]
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
[Chorus: Alex Turner &
Josh Homme
]
One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
