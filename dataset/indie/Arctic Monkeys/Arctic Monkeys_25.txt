[Verse 1]
Well, the mourning was complete
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak
[Verse 2]
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart
[Chorus]
And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions
[Verse 3]
As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold
[Chorus]
Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said, "Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
