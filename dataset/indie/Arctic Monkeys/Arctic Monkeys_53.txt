[Verse 1: Helders,
Turner
, &
Helders & Turner
]
He knew what he wanted to say
But he didn't know how to word it
The dirty little Herbert
was seeking an escape
But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped
[Chorus: Helders & Turner]
'D' is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
[Verse 2: Helders,
Turner
, &
Helders & Turner
]
'D' is for
desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was alright
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
And every other episode
[Bridge: Turner, &
Turner & Helders
]
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel
â€”I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
[Chorus: Turner & Helders]
'D' is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
