[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs
[Verse]
Stop and wait a sec
And when you look at me like that, my darlin'
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though
It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start
[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs
[Bridge]
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs
and a smile
