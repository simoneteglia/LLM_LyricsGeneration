[Intro]
I'm pinned down by the dark
[Verse 1]
Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well-told gripe, the most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes
the way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze, then to my knees you do promote me
[
Chorus
]
I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
[Verse 2]
The light it fidgets through,
the thoughts'll soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance, the first and final chance
And course the audience of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam, she broke everyone's heart
[Chorus]
I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now so let's
Make a mess, lioness
[Bridge]
I'm pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark, oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
