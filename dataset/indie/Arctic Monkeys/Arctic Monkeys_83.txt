[Verse 1]
Richard of York
,
the Executive Branch
Having some fun with the warm-up act
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes
[Verse 2]
A four-figure sum on a hotel notepad
A revelation or your money back
That's what it takes to say goodnight
Sometimes, I wrap my head around it all
And it makes perfect sense
[Verse 3]
Keep remindin' me that it ain't a race
When my invincible streak turns onto the final straight
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes
