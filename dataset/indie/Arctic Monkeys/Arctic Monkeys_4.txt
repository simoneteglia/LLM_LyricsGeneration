[Verse 1]
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours
[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
[Verse 2]
Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours
[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
[Outro]
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (Wanna be yours)
Breathin' in your dust (Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (Wanna be yours)
I will never rust (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
