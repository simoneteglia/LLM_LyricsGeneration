[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
[Verse 1]
I've been feeling foolish, you should try it
She came and substituted the peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood
flow concertina
Cheating heart beat,
rapid fire
[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Here is your host,
sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms
[Verse 2]
She's been loop-the-looping around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood
concertina
Cheating heart beat,
rapid fire
[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
[Bridge]
In an unusual place, when you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day
[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
