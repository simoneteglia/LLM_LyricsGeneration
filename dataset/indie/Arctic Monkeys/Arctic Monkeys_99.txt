[Verse 1]
Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
With wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening continues
The dignity fucks off
Her brother's gone off to the strippers
To make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches
But she's actually alright
[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you ought to
Maybe not have any more
[Verse 2]
A country home, even if we really tried
Wouldn't cease to surprise us now
And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
When are your parents back? D'you know?
Well, I never came from no ghetto
But it wasn't nowhere near here
Well-spoken girls in stilettos
Aren't something to fear
[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you ought to
Maybe not have any more
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you ought to
Maybe not have any more
[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
Cigarette smoke doesn't hide as well as you think
And you'd think that it ought to
Act as the perfect disguise
