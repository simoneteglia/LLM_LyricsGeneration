[Verse 1]
A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes
[Verse 2]
Jealousy in technicolor
Fear by name, love by numbers
Street lamp amber, wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbuss
[Chorus]
She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for, honey
That's where you're wrong
[Verse 3]
All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles you can hold
And no understanding where it goes
[Chorus]
She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for, honey
That's where you're wrong
[Outro]
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
