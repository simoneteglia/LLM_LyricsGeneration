[Intro]
One, two, three, four
[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like)
[Verse 1]
Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor,
what a memorable NYE
[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
Good morning
(She looks like fun)
Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun)
Snowboarding
(She looks like)
[Verse 2]
Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be
[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
Bukowski
(She looks like fun)
Dogsitting
(She looks like fun)
Screwballing
(She looks like)
[Verse 3]
Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but
why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are
[Bridge]
No one's on the streets
We moved it all online as of March
I'm so full of shite
I need to spend less time stood around in bars
Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them
[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
Key changes
(She looks like fun)
Re-thinking
(She looks like fun)
New order
(She looks like fun)
