[Verse 1]
Darlin’, tell me something I don’t know
Be my baby, be my GTO
Call me something no one else calls me
I forget how I want it,
that electricity
[Chorus]
Well, my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?
[Verse 2]
Love like locked horns,
love like dominos
Be my midnight,
be my ebb and flow
I forget how I want it,
how it crept up on me
It takes over, electricity
[Chorus]
And my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?
[Bridge]
Separated, there I face it
Love like thunder, love like falling snow
[Chorus]
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?
