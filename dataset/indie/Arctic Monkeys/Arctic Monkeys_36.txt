[Verse 1]
Well, last night these two bouncers
And one of 'em's alright, the other one's a scary'un
His way or no way; totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathin'
How he don't want you to,
so step out the queue
He makes examples of you,
and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got somethin' to prove
To all the smirkin' faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a
duff
Well, secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah
[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this mornin'
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
[Verse 2]
Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn'ta done that on a Sunday
Of course not
[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this mornin'
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
[Bridge]
Last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore
I said, last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore, oh
[Outro]
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
