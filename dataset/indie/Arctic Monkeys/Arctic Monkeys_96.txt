[Verse 1]
Well, the times are slowly changing
Baby, even when it's live
You can press pause and rewind
You knew it'd go amazing
But is this what you had in mind?
Oh, there's nothing you can't find
[Chorus]
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(
Yeah
)
[Verse 2]
On the back of a transmitter
There's a little shiny fruit
And it's coming after you
As for Instagram and Twitter
She got caught in both lassoes
And neither one will cut her loose
[Chorus]
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thir–

(
Yeah
)
Yeah
[Bridge]
So, baby, take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There's magic like you won't believe, no
[Chorus]
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
