[Verse 1]
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like lookin' down the barrel of a gun, and it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you, a side I much prefer
[Chorus]
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's right hard to remember that on a day like today
When you're all argumentative,
and you've got the face on
[Verse 2]
Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pullin' that silent disappointment face, the one that I can't bear
[Chorus]
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that on a day like today
When you're all argumentative,
and you've got the face on
[Bridge]
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train and then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
Oh, when you say I don't care
But of course I do, yeah, I clearly do
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Oh, but it's reight hard to remember that on a day like today
When you're all
Argumentative,
and you've got the face on
