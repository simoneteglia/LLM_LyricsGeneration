[Verse 1]
I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms
It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean
[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna hang on
[Verse 2]
I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd spend it chasing after you
'Cause she's not shattering my attitudes
No matter how she folds the potion
Yours is the only ocean
[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to
[Bridge]
Potion approaching, shield your eyes
Potion approaching, visualise
Holding a token, swollen in size
Potion approaching, shield your eyes
[Outro]
Oh, but if we're gonna escape though
We really ought to think it through
Would you like me to build you a go-kart?
