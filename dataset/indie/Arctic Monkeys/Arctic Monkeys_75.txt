[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die
[Verse 2: Oisin Leech]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
Yours until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time
[Bridge: Alex Turner]
I'm gonna stay right here by your side
And do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in the world could drive me away
Every day, you'll hear me say
[Verse 3: Alex Turner]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours until two and two is three
Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until
eternity
[Outro: Alex Turner &
Oisin Leech
]
Baby, I'm yours, 'til the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours
, until the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours
, until the sun no longer shines
Baby, I'm yours
, until the poets run out of rhyme
Baby, I'm yours
