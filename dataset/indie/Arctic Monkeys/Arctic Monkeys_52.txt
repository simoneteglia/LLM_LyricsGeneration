[Verse 1]
Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
But the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry
[Chorus]

And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale

Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
