[Verse 1]
So when you gaze at planet Earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase
[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on Parliament Brawl
Emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
With God on videocall
[Verse 2]
Breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of "You don't know what you're doing"
[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many Lolas
[Bridge]
And all of my most muscular regrets
Explode behind my eyes like American sports
Hoo
[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas
