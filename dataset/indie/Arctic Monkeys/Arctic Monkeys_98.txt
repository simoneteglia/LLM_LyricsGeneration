[Verse 1]
Black as a beacon in a river of shimmering fog
Yes, she was
If you were heatseeking, she was hard to ignore
Yes, she was
[Chorus]
And she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particular pretty ones
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on
[Verse 2]
Well, time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
Tha knows
[Chorus]
And she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particular pretty ones
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on
[Bridge]
Shake love's steady hand
Shake love's steady
She floats like a niccy rush and stings like a B-flat
The blond-o-sonic shimmer trap
[Chorus]
And she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particular pretty ones
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on
