Who the safety is for
Danger knocks not at the door
Don't let your heart hit the floor now
There is pillage in villages, all have been labored to fight
Please get this caught in your eye
Who
There is suffering
There is suffering
Know at first, no you don't
Then your face it advances the corner
Times getting shorter and shorter
Why waste your fine life? Yeah
See it's all already fostered in for ya
Can't you just feel for another
Run
I implore ya
I implore ya
You have gone to the sale
You have gone to the stable or till
What will you do with your will?
Will you empty?
Will you fill?
The fall ain't get colder
This is farther and farther from over
You're in the margins of time
What say you
What say your honor?
What say your honor?
