For only takers, stand and take in where you are
Turn around and face it, you're adjacent to the scar
"I want mine here though"
We heard that story before (
Woo, hahaha
)
What you think we're taming with the towers and the oar?
You keep evading boy, you putting me flat on the floor
It's okay,
you were young when you were gave it
But you stayed there
And you’d expect it when we photograph our scars
Some lonely fable that we took in then right from the start
I want it back
I want it back
Won’t you tell me how to get it back?
I want it back
I want it back
Why won't you tell me how to get it back?
My, my, my, my
I'm coming over for another story told
I'm saying homie that it's not what you been sold
It's hardly what you'd know
The ordinary something neither of us holds
No folding gold for protecting from the lords
Who's that really we leave out in the cold?
But they're depending, so you just keep giving pause
"I must defend it", oh, the tariffs hit you hard
Just keep adding up boy, you'll be below regard
