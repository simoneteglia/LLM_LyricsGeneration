[Verse 1]
Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stayed tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing
[Verse 2]
Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue
[Verse 3]
I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in
[Verse 4]
Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour
[Bridge]
I will run (all around it)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
I'mma make it half the night
Hall light wishes
[Verse 5]
To walk aside your favor
I'm an Astuary King
I'll keep in a cave, your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming
[Bridge]
I will run (all around it)
(Sailing off and on, you're on your honor)
Have to crawl (carry off and up your seas)
Still can't— (Along—)
I will run (carry up love along unfettered time)
Now Mona (Now Mona)
[Outro]
Haven't I locked up my failure (sailing off and ore your odd, your honour)
From the core to the sky
Wouldn't I be last to see? (carry off and up your seas)
From the door till we die
Deny with love my labour (carry up with love a long)
Was it all I could find (atonements defined)
Keep waking up high
