[Intro]
If you wait, it won't be undone
[Verse 1]
Well, it's all just scared of dying
But isn't this a beach?
And if I know one thing at all
Is I cannot just be a peach
Oh, you come in all woke now
So, please enjoy the feast
We are weightless like a wayless beast
So what is it we don't teach?
[Pre-Chorus]
When we were children we were hell-bent
Or oblivious at least
But now it comes to mind
We are terrified
So we run and hide
For a verified little peace
[Chorus 1]
So what of this release?
Sun light feels good now, don't it?
And I don't have a leaving plan
But something's gotta ease your mind
But it's all fine, or it's all crime anyway
[Verse 2]
There were six of us sitting creek side
Sifting fistfuls through the green
Every which way could be seen
Was the sand and time
Not a pantomime
More like anodyne
Was a friend of mine
You'da known, you'da known
[Pre-Chorus]
I could prophet
I could rob I
, however
Everywhere isnâ€™t everywhere
This is not a veil
Or a fairy tale in the least
[Chorus 2]
So what of this release?
Some life feels good now, don't it?
(I think I need it)
Don't have to have a leaving plan
(Have to let it)
Nothing's gonna ease your mind
Well, it's all fine and we're all fine anyway
[Outro]
But if you wait, it won't be undone
