Part I: Drinking This Rain
[Verse 1]
I'm with the cornfields as my witness
I've run out of brain
Come on down to the place where I'm drinking
Come on down like the rain
[Chorus]
And if you don't come quick
I'm gonna dry up in this world
I think it's all coming down
All 'cause of a girl
And it's coming to me
Like a baseball to a bat
And I'm only hitting .118
And I'm wondering where you're at
[Verse 2]
And the oak on the bar
Is like the oak in my heart
And like the oak buried deep down in the sand
I got a water it hard
[Chorus]
And it goes in through my mouth
And it slides into my veins
And it takes away my head
And I don't have to feel the same
And my eyes go red
And my skin goes warm
And at the end of the night
I'm just cryin' in my bed
[Outro]
Some call it sick
And some call it pain
And some just laugh at it
But honey, it's like the rain
It's like when you're thirsty and there's none in the well
It's like bringing darkness when darkness has already fell
It's like breaking dreams of a broken man
And nothing makes it come on down
Like the rain came
Part 2: I'm On Fire
[Verse 1]
Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?
Did he go on and leave you all alone?
I've got a bad desire
Oh, I'm on fire
[Verse 2]
Tell me now, baby, is he good to you?
Can he to do you the things I don't do?
You know I could take you higher
Mmm, I'm on fire
[Verse 3]
It's like someone took a nap, baby, edge of the door
Six inch banner through the middle of my skull
At night I wake up with the sheets open wide
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
You can cool my desire
Mmm, I'm on fire
Mmm, I'm on fire
No, I'm on fire
[Outro]
Thank you very much everybody
