[Verse 1]
Ring on the bar
A clinging watermark
It hints at what I had
And calls up what I can't
[Verse 2]
Ring you out of me
Shake the memory free
Can't squash the moping soak
Can't chase away the hope
[Chorus]
I have buried you
In every place I've been
You keep ending up
In my shaking hands
[Verse 3]
Ring, sound the alarm
The sting, my broken arm
There's a famous violinist
Buried in my gut
There are chances and choices
Sometimes you just have to cut
[Chorus]
I have buried you
In every place I've been
You keep ending up
In my shaking hands
I have buried you
In my shaking hands
You keep ending up
Every place I've been
[Breakdown]
I have buried you
Every place I've been
You keep ending up
In my shaking hands
You keep ending up
In every place I've been
In my shaking hands
Every place I've been
