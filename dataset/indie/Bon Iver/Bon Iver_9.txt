[Verse 1]
I am my mother's only one
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know
[Chorus]
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
[Verse 2]
I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more
[Chorus]
Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish rouge
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
