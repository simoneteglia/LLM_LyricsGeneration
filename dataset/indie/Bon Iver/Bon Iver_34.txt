[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
Mmm, mmm
I will see you off now
Down the back of the ridge
There's just something that I got to show you
There is domer and there's rot
And the common case
It ain't nothing what you say is true
[Chorus: Justin Vernon, Jenn Wasner, & Elsa Jensen]
With your long arms, try
And just give some time
Presently, it does include my dues
Ain't your standard premonitions
All this phallic repetition
Boy, you tell yourself a tale or two
[Post-Chorus: Jenn Wasner, Moses Sumney, & Elsa Jensen]
Man like you
Man, improve
[Verse 2:
Bruce Hornsby
, (Moses Sumney), &
Brooklyn Youth Chorus
]
Well, I know that we set off for a common place
(And the lines have run too deep)
How much caring is there of some American love
When there's lovers sleeping in your streets?
[Chorus: Justin Vernon, Jenn Wasner, & Elsa Jensen]
So Cerberus Ride
Bring those dead alive
Like Pirate Jenny on the Black Freighter
It'll be a long day of fixing
Make something else your mission
Boy, why this shit's so hard to cue?
[Post-Chorus: Moses Sumney]
Man like you
How you do?
[Outro: Justin Vernon, Bruce Hornsby, Jenn Wasner, Elsa Jensen, & Moses Sumney]
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Hey
