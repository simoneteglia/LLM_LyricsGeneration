[Verse 1]
Lay low, little babe
Rest your head, precious child
You’re all old and grown now
But you’re still the same inside
[Chorus]
Standin’ on the whippgrass
Standin’ on the whippgrass
Sittin’ on the whippgrass
Watch and see how we last
[Verse 2]
You’re not alone tonight, babe
You’re not so far from your home
You got the strength of all us, babe
And I give a prayer when I'm home
[Chorus]
Sittin’ on the whippgrass
Sittin’ on the whippgrass
I'm sittin’ on the whippgrass
I’m so full and this is so vast
[Verse 3]
I know we’ll all be together, babe
Someday, somehow
Carry to a higher bound, babe
It’s not a sight or a sound
[Bridge]
Smokin’ around
It’s within me somehow
I’ll carry to all I am bound
The truth that I have found
[Chorus]
Standing on the whippgrass
It moves along the whippgrass
When it moves along the whippgrass
It moves along the whippgrass
It moves along the whippgrass
It moves along the whippgrass
Somehow it lasts
