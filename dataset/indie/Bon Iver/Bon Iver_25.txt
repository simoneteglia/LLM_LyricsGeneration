[Verse 1]
I was unafraid, I was a boy, I was a tender age
Melic in the naked, knew a lake and drew the lofts for page
Hurdle all the waitings up, I know it wasn't wedded love, why?
Four long minutes in and it was over, it'd all be back
And the frost took up the eyes
[Verse 2]
Pressed against the pane
Could see the veins and there was poison out
Resting in a raze, the inner claims I hadn't breadth to shake
Searching for an inner clout, may not take another bout, why?
Honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain
Hon', it wasn't yet the spring
[Verse 3]
Aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out
Nose up in the globes, you never know if you are passing out
No, it wasn't maiden-up, the falling or the faded luck, why?
Hung up in the ivory, both were climbing for a finer cause
Love can hardly leave the room
With your heart
