Now I'm more
Than I am when we started
Benefolance
I'm not sinking — I'm not synching
Five lane divers
(I'ma take it in)
(I'ma take it in)
The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water
The math ahead
The math behind
Moon water
Rememorize numb
And half the hum
For moon water
I'd hide Berlin
To run and find it
Moon water
The path ahead
The path behind it
It's moon water
Now I'm more
Than I am when we started
Benefolance
I'm not sinking — I'm not synching
Five lane divers
Now I'm more
Than I am when we started
