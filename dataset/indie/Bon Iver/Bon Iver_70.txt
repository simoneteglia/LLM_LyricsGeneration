I don't like the way it's, I don't like the way it's
I don't like the way it's looking
I can't go through the motions, can't go through the motions
How am I supposed to do this now?
I am afraid of changing
The way I look back makes me a competitor
There are things behind things behind things
There are rings within rings within rings
I got caught compiling, I got caught compiling
I got caught compiling my own news
And I don't like the way I'm, I don't like the way I'm
I don't like the way I'm looking
I got caught looking in the mirror
The way I look back makes me my own predator
There are things behind things behind things
There are rings within rings within rings
There are things behind things behind things
There are rings within rings within rings
