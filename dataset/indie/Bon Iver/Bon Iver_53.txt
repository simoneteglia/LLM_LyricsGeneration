[Verse 1]
Every passing minute
Is a thought of you not in it
Wishing I could do some nothing
And you could do the same
Every time the lighting changes
The whole city rearranges
I can't find familiar without you
[Chorus]
Even when the sun goes down (Ah)
Still know my world goes 'round (Ah)
Playin' Bon Iver on late night drives
My window, moon, and fireflies
Holdin' on to moments that we found
Even when the sun goes down (Ah)
[Verse 2]
I still look for pieces
Of home, but it decreases
Fading like a T-shirt left to dry out in the sun
There's too much time to spend alone
Crunching numbers on my phone
Wondering when our stars will meet again
[Chorus]
Maybe when the sun goes down (Ah)
Still know my world goes 'round (Ah)
Playin' Bon Iver on late night drives
My window, moon, and fireflies
Holdin' on to moments that we found
Even when the sun goes down (Ah)
[Bridge]
Time waits for no one
But there's beauty
In the moments
And the spaces
In between
[Chorus]
Even when the sun goes down
Still know my world goes 'round
Playin' Bon Iver on late night drives
My window, moon, and fireflies
Holdin' on to moments that we found
Even when the sun goes down (Ah)
Even when the sun goes down (Ah)
