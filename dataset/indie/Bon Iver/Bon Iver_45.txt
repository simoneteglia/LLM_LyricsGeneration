[Verse 1]
You ride in the park and you're peaking
Piss pools in your seat
She's standing inside but you surely repeat
Oh, God, don't leave me here,
I will freeze 'til the end
Love is love's reprieve
[Verse 2]
Winter is coming and you're stuck here
Oh, and so is she
Winter has come and your stacking
All your summer shoes
Love is love's sad news
[Chorus]
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go, I take another place with me
Love is love's mystique
[Verse 3]
You're up on the bar and you're shaking
With every grimy word
Who will you love? What's love when you've hurt?
Oh, you wonder as you see the snow kissed the curb
Love is love's return
[Chorus]
That was Wisconsin, that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go, I take another place with me
Love is love's critique
