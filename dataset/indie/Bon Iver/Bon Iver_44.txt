[Verse 1]
Well, angel, morning
Sivanna
Well, ain't been gone too far
But heading out towards Ponoma
Where you won't be alone
[Verse 2]
Where there's thrift store manager in a poke camadee
And a gas mask on his arm
And one by one by one
We'll all be gone
[Chorus]
We'll all be gone by the fall
We'll all be gone by the falling light
[Verse 3]
Brick layer
With a hat down on his feet
I'll say no more
I won't lead no Calvary
[Bridge]
How long
Will you disregard the heat?
Half beat
It's no misnomer though
[Outro]
I've the feeling that I better go
So
I slide right out the door, oh
