[Verse 1]
I was full by your count
I was lost but your fool
Was a long visit wrong?
Say you are the only
[Chorus]
So many foreign worlds, so relatively fucked
So ready for us, so ready for us
The creature fear
[Verse 2]
I was teased by your blouse
Spit out by your mouth
I was loud by your lowered
Seminary sold
Tear on, tail on
Take all on the wind on
The soft bloody nose
Sign another floor
[Chorus]
So many territories, ready to reform
Don’t let it form us, don’t let it form us
The creature fear
So did he foil his own? Is he ready to reform?
So many Torahs, so many for us
The creature fear
