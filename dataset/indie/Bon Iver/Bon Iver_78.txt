[Verse 1]
Norwegian coffee, melting mud
And a winter that just lingers on
I'm wonderin' when enough is enough
Slippin' heating packets underneath your cup
The time keeps ploughin' on, it's a march
And by 5 o'clock its already dark
I'm seein' you see everyone but me
Watchin' you get drunk makes me wanna be
[Chorus]
Honey be my little sun
When we ain't gettin' none
Cup your hands round a match
And fasten up your last jacket latch
Stand and sway with me
In the dark cold loneliness Marie
[Verse 2]
Familiar death markin' miles
And there's a fleetin' sense of restoration
The ice and snow left bruises on your knee
And the heaters blowin' but it don't blow with ease
The months won't move, we are stuck
In the rollin' quiet of this little truck
White sand bags are weighin' down the back
Where the skeletons of Christmas still lay in plastic sacks
[Chorus]
Honey be my little sun
When we ain't gettin' none
Cup your hands round a match
Fasten up your last jacket latch
Stand and sway with me
In the dark cold loneliness Marie
[Chorus]
Honey be my little sun
When we ain't gettin' none
Cup your hands round a match
Fasten up your last jacket latch
Stand and sway with me
In the dark cold loneliness Marie
