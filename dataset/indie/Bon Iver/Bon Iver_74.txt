[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
If I had it all
Make sure my family never struggles
I'd lift the poor
I'd pay the rent for random people
If I had it all
I'd see LeBron
From a floor seat in the Staples
I'd give a lot
I'd buy a star (Ooh, ooh)
I'd own a yacht
But a hardship is expensive
[Bridge]
Pain don't care if you rich (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Pain don't care if you not
Pain don't care what you got
Pain gon' fuck up your spot
Pain gon' fuck up your—, pain gon'—
Pain don't care if you rich (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Pain don't care if you not
Pain don't care what you got
Pain gon' fuck up your spot
Pain gon' fuck up your—, pain gon'—
[Verse 2]
Don't need an answer
It's okay to feel emotions
No explanation, just emotion
Yeah, I'm okay
Just a human with emotions (Ooh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh my-my, my
Human nature loves to lie, and say I'm by myself
(Oh, I'm not alone)
Peace is around my feet
Speak like it is, what it might not be (Ooh, oh, woah, oh)
[Chorus]
So I take all my cares and play Bon Ivеrre
'til I get my head ovеr water
And I feel unaware, so I
Sing a prayer 'til I get my head over water (Yeah)
[Bridge]
In a zone (Bon Iverre)
I tried about everything to find my own spot
I keep starin', I keep scrollin' on my phone, babe
I've been pushin', I've been fightin' for a long while
[Chorus]
So I take all my cares and play Bon Iverre
Til I get my head over water
And I feel unaware so Sing
A prayer 'til I get my head over water (Ooh, woah)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Outro]
Maybe I'ma think deeper
I don't know you think of the word "seconds"
Like, it, it means to be after something
And, uh
We measure time with the word "second"
Seconds are hmm, you know what is a second to?
What is it after?
Hmm, and I don't know
My thought process is, you know maybe this life is secondary
And, there's something eternal, that's primary
That we should be livin' for
Uh, think deep though
