[Verse 1]
(It might be over soon,
two, two)
(It might be over soon)
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
And if it's ever gonna happen
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon
[Verse 2]
(All these years)
There I find you marked in constellation
(two, two)
There isn't ceiling in our garden
And then I draw an ear on you
So I can speak into the silence
It might be over soon
,
two, do, two
(It might be over soon)
Do, two
[Verse 3]
(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
Oh and I have carried consecration
And then you expelled all decision
As I may stand up with a vision
Caught daylight, god damn right
Within a rise, there lies a scission
(It might be over soon)
