[Verse 1]
So apropos
Saw death on a sunny snow
[Chorus]
For every life
Forgo the parable
Seek the light
My knees are cold
[Post-Chorus]
Running home, running home
Running home, running home
[Verse 2]
Go find another lover
To bring a
To string along
[Chorus]
With all your lies
You're still very lovable
I toured the light
So many foreign roads
[Post-Chorus]
For Emma, forever ago
