[Verse 1]
Sixes hang in the door
What kind of shit to ignore
I've cut the cloth
(Ooh... hard line circle)
How to know who to write
How to know who can cull up all the questions
We know that I'm right, cause
To clean out a night
I fell in love
[Chorus 1]
I heard about it (bit by bit)
I heard about it (bit by bit)
I heard about it (bit by bit)
[Verse 2]
And so it's not in your clasp
Then what's the function or the task
Well, I'd stun and I'd stammer
Help me reach the hammer
(For then what will I ask?)
That's a pair of them docks
Mooring out two separate lochs
Ain't that some kind of quandry
(Waundry)
Take me into your palms
What is left when unhungry?
[Chorus 2]
I learned about it (bit by bit)
I learned about it (bit by bit)
I've learned about it (bit by bit)
[Verse 3]
I'm still standing in
Still standing in the need of prayer
The need of prayer
No, I don't know the path
Or what kind of pith I've amassed
Long lines of questions
And lessons (lessons, lessons)
But what do you lose to concede?
And yes it's hard to believe when 'em sold for your sleeves
Just come off of your kneel
Please, please, please
I can admit to conceal
No, that's not how that's supposed to feel
Oh no, it's not for broader appeal
Fuck the fashion of it, dear
[Chorus 3]
I've laughed about it (bit by bit)
I've laughed about it (bit by bit)
I've laughed about it (bit by bit)
