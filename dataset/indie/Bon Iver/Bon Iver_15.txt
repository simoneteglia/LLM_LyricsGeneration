[Verse 1]
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain will mark you
Harness your blame
Harness your blame and walk through
[Chorus]
With the wild wolves around you
In the morning, I'll call you
Send it farther on
[Verse 2]
Solace my game
Solace my game, it stars you
Swing wide your crane
Swing wide your crane and run me through
[Chorus]
And the story's all over you
In the morning, I'll call you
Can't you find a clue
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue?
[Bridge]
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been (Don't bother me)
What might have been (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost (Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
[Outro]
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain
Someday, my pain
