[Refrain]
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Well, I thought that this was half a love, love
Follow to the rising sea
Well, I thought that this was half a love
[Refrain]
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Well, I thought that this was half a love
Follow to the rising sea
Well, I thought that this was
half a love
[Outro]
Whoo
When I'm falling to the right
