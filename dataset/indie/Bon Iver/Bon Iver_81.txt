[Verse 1]
All our lives
We've been here
Close to the center
Of the largest grinding gear
Things we knew
We knew 'cause we stayed near
You were my love
For all of my best years
[Verse 2]
Rifles crack
Their lonesome sound
For twenty miles outside of town
Tears fall on my muddy feet
I quiver as the pulleys squeak
As they lower you so slowly in the ground
[Outro]
Your niece, she sings
An angel's song
Hannah, love, I hope it won't be long
Hannah, love, I hope it won't be long
