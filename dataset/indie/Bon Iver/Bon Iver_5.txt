[Verse 1]
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
[Chorus]
Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you
Down
Dancing around
Folds in her gown
[Verse 2]
Sea and the rock below
Cocked to the undertow
Bones, blood, and teeth erode
With every crashing node
[Chorus]
Wings wouldn't help you
Wings wouldn't help you
Down
Down fills the ground
Gravity's proud
[Verse 3]
You barely are blinking
Wagging your face around
When'd this just become a mortal home?
Now
[Chorus]
Won't, won't, won't, won't, won't let you talk me
Won't let you talk me
Down
Will pull it taut
Nothing let out
