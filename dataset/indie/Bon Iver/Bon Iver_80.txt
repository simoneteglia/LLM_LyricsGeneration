[Verse 1]
It feels like home to me
An' I know just where I wanna be
Home is where your family sleeps
Same country sky is honest like it's always been
[Verse 2]
Same yard, same trees
Same smells in the air as the season's keep
An' I remember when I was seventeen
Cuttin' the grass, brother shootin basketball with me
[Verse 3]
Fall means autumn midnight warms the
Cold sunny air, an' it blows through me
Pick me up and set me down
Lay in this field and listen to the sounds of all them roads
All them roads
[Verse 4]
Roads that lead me home
Been on thousands of times
Its beauty and strength only grows
With each passing of the day
[Verse 5]
Morning breaks the dawn
And afternoon slides by
Crickets cradle the softly blue bruising sky
They turn into the skipping record on the turning black, black night
But it all feels like home
It all feels like home
[Bridge]
It all feels like home to me
Same country sky, oh
It all feels like home
'Cause you're all on your own, oh
Cold sunny air all over me
[Outro]
It feels like home, home
