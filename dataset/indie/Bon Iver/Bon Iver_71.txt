[Verse 1]
Untied me from the buoy
I sank, so you cooed to me
Fall like a wrench
Fall like a runner
Fall like a wall
[Verse 2]
Surface splits to prism
A chorus-less rhythm
Sly means
Clock clean
Up, see, you down at me
[Outro]
I'm planning out your farm
Sealing off and on
My way to make my own
Discernible mark
