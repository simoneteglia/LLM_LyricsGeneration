[Verse 1]
You talk about affinity
You talk about, you telling me
Your habitat
The harbor lights they follow me
They're tearing at our company
Can't you see?
[Chorus]
I'm cold like a carver
Cold like a wind
Bold, gentle, stubborn
Your rolling waves
[Verse 2]
I'm baffled by your symmetry
I'm underneath the bodhi tree
Waiting on your game
To send me to some other joy
I'll pick you up and write you notes
Fancy meeting you here
[Chorus]
'Cause you're old like the street names
Feels old like our card games
Tired ass on a morning pain
I tie you up with me
[Verse 3]
You will somehow make me learn
What is it inside me that
Burns?
A carnival inside this mind
Just to divert roadside sign
Directing you all the way
[Chorus]
Feels old like your pages
I'm feeling born like your babies
I've been boarded up like cages
But I'm busting out
But I'm busting out
[Outro]
And don't you give up on me
Don't be like me 'cause you love me
Don't give up on me
Don't be like me 'cause you love me
Bend
Bend
