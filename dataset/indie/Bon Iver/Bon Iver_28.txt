[Intro: Mike Noyce]
All my life
Ini was
Ooh, mine was a lover of a wrong kind
Keeping what you telling me
I know mine
[Verse 1: Justin Vernon,
Camilla Staveley-Taylor
&
Velvet Negroni
]
Living in a lonesome way
Had me looking other ways
'Cause
I am, I am, I am
lost here, again
But on a bright fall morning, I'm with it
I stood a little while within it
Man, you have to know
Know the way
[Chorus: Justin Vernon &
Camilla Staveley-Taylor
]
It goes,
it goes
,
it goes
I am, I am, I am, I am
It goes
,
It goes
I
am, I am, I am, I am
[Verse 2: Justin Vernon &
Velvet Negroni
]
If forgiveness is a chore
What you waiting for?
We been here before
And I can't ignore it anymore
You know the way it goes
How much longer then? (
I'll show you in
)
(
Now I'll tell you why
)
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Camilla Staveley-Taylor]
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
[Post-Chorus: Velvet Negroni]
Ain't no say what I do in
Every day say they don't like it, I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
"Hey, don't like it", I say
[Interlude: Justin Vernon
& Camilla Staveley-Taylor
]
If that ain't just the truth
I am, I am, I am, I am
I like you, I like you
And that ain't nothing new
[Outro: Velvet Negroni,
James Blake
&
Camilla Staveley-Taylor
]
And if it don't happen like that
Well, then it don't happen at all
Keepin' what you tell me
(Said Ini)
Now I won't lie
