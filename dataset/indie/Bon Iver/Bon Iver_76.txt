[Verse 1]
When the time comes
When your love is lost on me
I will grant you sympathy
If you let me down
Easy
[Verse 2]
When the time comes
When the weeds have grown over
And the knave is all stone
If you let me down
Easy
[Verse 3]
When the time comes
and you have to let me go
I will leave without a sound
If you let me down
Easy
