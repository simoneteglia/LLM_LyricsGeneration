[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey 亲爱的，我看着你静静站着
With his arms around your body 他的手臂挽住你身
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all 言语毫无幽默，你却开然而笑
And it took you five whole minutes 你仅用了五分钟
To pack us up and leave me with it 打理干净一切 离于我
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall 在空然无人的走廊里捧着满手的爱
[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before 我想我已经看过这部影片
And I didn't like the ending 并没有喜欢这种结局
You're not my homeland anymore 你不再是我的故乡
So what am I defending now? 所以我现在还为什么捍卫？
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out 你曾是我的家园，而我现在被驱逐，看你远步离去
I think I've seen this film before 我想我已经看过这部影片
[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey 亲爱的，我看见你的目光盯琢
Like he's just your understudy 就像他是你的替身一般
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me 就像你曾会为我而手指染血
Second, third, and hundredth chances 第二，第三，和第百个机会
Balancin' on breaking branches 在断落的树枝上保持平衡
Those eyes add insult to injury 那双眼睛仿佛在伤口上撒盐
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before 我想我已经看过这部影片
And I didn't like the ending 并没有喜欢这种结局
I'm not your problem anymore 我不再是你的包袱
So who am I offending now? 所以现在我冒犯了谁？
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out 你曾是我的王冠，而我现在被驱逐，看你远步离去
I think I've seen this film before 我想我已经看过这部影片
So I'm leaving out the side door 现在我从旁门悄悄离开
[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount 大胆站出来
Of crying I can do for you 我为你掉再多泪也不足
All this time 所有这段时间
We always walked a very thin line 你我都小心翼翼踩着同一根线
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out) 我的诉说被你无视 （你无视我的诉说）
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 你从未给我任何提示 （我给了那么多提示）
All this time 所有这段时间
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind) 我没有读懂你的心情 （你从未试过读懂我）
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around) 我没能够挽救这段情感 （你未能挽救这段情感）
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 因为你从未给我任何提示 （我给了那么多提示）
So many signs, so many signs 这么多提示，这么多警告
You didn't even see the signs 你从来没有注意到
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before 我想我已经看过这部影片
And I didn't like the ending 并没有喜欢这种结局
I'm not your problem anymore 我不再是你的包袱
So who am I offending now? 所以现在我冒犯了谁？
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out 你曾是我的王冠，而我现在被驱逐，看你远步离去
I think I've seen this film before 我想我已经看过这部影片
So I'm leaving out the side door 现在我从旁门悄悄离开
[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount 大胆站出来
Of crying I can do for you 我为你掉再多泪也不足
All this time 所有这段时间
We always walked a very thin line 你我都小心翼翼踩着同一根线
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out) 我的诉说被你无视 （你无视我的诉说）
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 你从未给我任何提示 （我给了那么多提示）
All this time 所有这段时间
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind) 我没有读懂你的心情 （你从未试过读懂我）
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around) 我没能够挽救这段情感 （你未能挽救这段情感）
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) 因为你从未给我任何提示 （我给了那么多提示）
You never gave a warning sign (All this time) 你从未给我任何提示 (所有这段时间）
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind （这么多回合）我没有读懂你的心情
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around) （这么多警告）我没能挽救这段情感
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign) 因为你从未给我任何提示 （你从未给我任何提示）
You never gave a warning sign 从未给我过任何提示
Ah, ah
