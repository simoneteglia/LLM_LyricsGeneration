[Verse 1]
I'm tearing up
Across your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something fane
This is not a place
Not yet awake
I'm raised of make
[Chorus]
Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love
[Verse 2]
In a mother, out a moth
Furling forests for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, is pouring; wire it up!
You're breaking your ground
