[Verse 1]
Don't you cherish me to sleep, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Never keep your eyelids clipped
Hold me for the pops and clicks
I was only for the father's crib
[Verse 2]
Hair, old, long along
Your neck onto your shoulder blades, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Always keep that message taped
Cross your breasts you won't erase
I was only for your very space
[Verse 3]
Hip, under nothing
Propped up by your other one, face 'way from the sun
Just have to keep a dialogue
Teach our bodies: haunt the cause
I was only trying to spell a loss
[Verse 4]
Joy, it's all founded
Pincher with the skin inside, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You pinned me with your black sphere eyes
You know that all the rope's untied
I was only for to die beside
[Bridge]
So it's storming on the lake
Little waves our bodies break
There's a fire going out
But there's really nothing to the south
Swollen orange and light let through
Your one-piece swimmer stuck to you
[Verse 5]
Sold, I'm ever
Open ears and open eyes, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Wake up to your starboard bride
Who goes in and then stays inside
Oh, the demons come, they can subside
[Voicemail Outro]
"...really great. Sorry, I like, really don't want to be with people right now. I can't really do it"
