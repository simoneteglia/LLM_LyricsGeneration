[Verse 1]
Danger been stepping in
I'm happy as I ever been
Couldn't tell ya what the cadence is
It's folded in the evidences
[Verse 2]
So you wanna leave a mark?
You're honing in on Meadow Park?
I heard you guys are very safe
Caught up with the featherweights
[Chorus]
The dawn is rising
The land ain't rising
No, no, no
Flash hope
Pass the throw
[Verse 3]
Coming in very late
Just above our pay grades
You ask me not to pull alarms
We have to act our ages
[Chorus]
The dawn is rising
But the land ain't rising
No, no, no
Catch up
You wanna go the fast way?
[Bridge]
Bonded weights
Don't favor them
If it's all that you don't do
It's lacerate
Better let them pass away
[Outro]
Stay, go?
Better that you find a new way
Before my eyes
Couldn't learn it any other way
By the way
