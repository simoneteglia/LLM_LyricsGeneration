[Intro 0:00 - 1:32]
[Verse 1]
Chained to the wall of our room
Yeah you chained me like a dog in our room;
I thought that's how what was
I thought that we were fine
Then the day was night -
You were high, you were high when I was doomed
And dying for with no light, with no light
[Verse 2]
Tied to my bed;
Oh, I was younger then
I had nothing to spend but time on you
But it made me love, it made me love, it made me love more -
It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more -
[Verse 3]
Do what you said, the words she said left out
Over unto the sky where I'll soon fly
And she took her time
To believe in, to believe in, what she said
And she made me love, she made me love, she made me love more -
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more -
[Outro]
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more -
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more -
