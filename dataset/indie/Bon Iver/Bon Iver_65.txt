[Version 1, 07/18/2015]
[Verse 1]
South of the lake
With a tall rider
In the mist of the cave
Where there's seldom any hiding
Billy, hold out your arms
Billy, hold out your arms
I need a guide now
I'm not going in alone
I
[Verse 2]
I was a stone
A sore loser
I passed the shore
Of a sailor-gone-bruiser
I believe in your light
I've already been through your illusions
Step on into the light
I'm telling you you're grown
[Chorus]
And if there's tasks for me
Darling, let it be known
That if you'd have with me
Safe pass on the long path
And I'd be first to see
What may not always be shown
God bless our long nights
[Verse 3]
What I have is who I carry home
Well, I'm telling you you're gone
Don't wanna leave you alone
I wanna leave you alone
I cannot leave you alone
I'll never leave you alone
I wanna leave you alone
I wanna leave you alone
I cannot leave you alone
I'll never leave you alone
[Chorus]
And if there's tasks for me
Darling, let it be known
And if you'd have with me
Safe pass on the long path
And I'd be first to see
What may not always be shown
Guarding our long nights
And a lot is at sky height
What I have is who I carry home
[Outro]
Well, I'm telling you you're wrong
Well, I'm telling you you're wrong
Well, I'm telling you you're wrong
[Version 2, 07/07/2018]
[Verse 1]
South of the lake
With a tall rider
South of the Cape
Where we're no longer hiding
Billy, hold out your arm
Billy, hold out your arm
I need a guide wire
Or I'm going in alone
I
[Verse 2]
I was a stone
A sore loser
I passed the shore
Of a sailor-gone-bruiser
I believe in your light
And I've already been through your illusions
So step on into the light
Well, I'm telling you you're grown
[Chorus]
And if there's tasks for me
Darling, let it be known
That if you'd have with me
Safe pass on the long path
Then I'd be first to see
What may not always be strong
Guarding our long nights
And our light is at sky height
[Verse 3]
What I have is who I carry home
I don't wanna be alone
I won't leave you alone
I cannot leave you alone
I'll never leave you alone
Don't wanna leave you alone
[Chorus]
Darling, let it be known
That if you'd have with me
Safe pass on the long path
Then I'd be first to see
What may not always be shown
Guarding our long nights
And our light is at sky height
What I have is who I carry home
[Outro]
Well, you're tearing up your eyes
Well, you're tearing up your eyes
