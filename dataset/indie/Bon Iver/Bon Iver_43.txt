[Verse 1]
Salem burns the leaves
Then she
Returns to cure and see
Heavy fate
After years of waiting
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause abnormalities
Surely
Are everywhere you see
So what I think we need
Is elasticity, empowerment and ease
[Chorus]
So I won't lead no lie
With our hearts the only matter why
How long it's lasted
I've not received reciprocity
[Verse 2]
To speak supportively
Big guy
There's no automatic peace
But I bet you'd keep
All these in-betweens that bar my youth
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no
anorberic
dream
Far as I know
I tried too hard to see
What I thought itâ€™d be
Asking constantly
How's it gonna be?
[Chorus]
So I'm gonna weep a while
You don't even know how hard
I learned a lesson
Don't ask me, I've
Torn the banner from the line
