[Verse 1]
Errant heat to the star
And the rain let in
And the
hawser rolls
, the vessel's whole
And Christ, it's thin
[Chorus 1]
Well, I'd know that you'd offer
Would reveal it, though it's soft and flat
Won't repeat it, cull and coffers that
For the
soffit
, hang this homeward
Pry it open with your love
Sending lost and alone standing offers
[Verse 2]
It is steep, it is stone
Such [recovery
/a cavalry]
From the daily press
, the deepest nest
In keeper's keep
[Verse 3]
All the news at the door
Such a revelry
Well, it's hocked inside
Of everything you said to me
[Chorus 2]
It was found what we orphaned
Didn't mention it would serve us picked
Said your love is known, I'm standing up on it
Aren't we married?
I ain't living in the dark no more
It's not a promise, I'm just gonna call it
[Verse 4]
Heavy mitted love, our love is a star
Sure some hazardry
For the light before and after
Most indefinitely
[Bridge]
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
([Danger has been stole away?])
([?])
[Outro]
This is
Axiom
(Ah)
