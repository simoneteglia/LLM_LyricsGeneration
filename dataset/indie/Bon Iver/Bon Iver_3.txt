[Verse 1]
Down along the creek
I remember something
Her, the heron hurried away
When first I breeched that last Sunday (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
Low moon don the yellow road
I remember something
That leaving wasn't easing all that heaving in my vines
And as certain it is evening 'at is NOW is not the time (Ooooh)
[Verse 3]
Toiling with your blood
I remember something
In B, unâ€”rationed
kissing on a night second to last
Finding both your hands as second sun came past the glass
And oh, I know it felt right and I had you in my grasp
[Verse 4]
Oh then, how we gonna cry?
Cause it once might not mean something?
And love
at second glance, it is not something that we'll need
Honey, understand that I have been left here in the reeds
But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the crease
[Outro]
And I see you
Turn around, you're my A Team
Turn around, now you're my A Team
GOD DAMN, turn around now
You're my A Team
