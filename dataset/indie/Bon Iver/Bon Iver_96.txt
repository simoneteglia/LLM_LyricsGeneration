[Intro]
Well, move over
Well, move over
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Well, move over
I'm topped over
And I've let out more than just a casted line
I've busted something
I'm broken inside
And This is where I go because you know me
[Refrain]
I return to you
[Verse 2]
I'm like copper
And you're like shoe shine
And the best is yet to come, you've got a lot of time
And alligators
And armadillos
Couldn't stop me from getting in through your doors
[Refrain]
And I return to you
And I return to you
[Verse 3]
I've just been through something
That's left me in pain
And it's true, it's cut me deeper than even you
And I now I realize
The pain and confusion
Are much heavier than love
[Outro]
So I return
So I return
So I return
So I return
To you
