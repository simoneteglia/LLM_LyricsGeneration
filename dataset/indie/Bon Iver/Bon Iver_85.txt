[Chorus]
Filling up your winning tin from spinning
Giving into villains, aid the feeling
You're killing
You're still it
[Verse 1]
Slash and burn the building of your fire
I'm landlocked
Finding out the hard way
I've finally found
What it's sunny for during the day
[Chorus]
Count up all the ways you can drew meaning
On legal pads, like British fads or leaning
You've seen it
So free it
[Verse 2]
Pouring in the proper path, no pressure
I'm pregnant
Feeling out the bitter life
Go ride your phony pony
Fall like the falling leaves of all the rest of us
[Chorus]
So later on, you can point and laugh
Point and laugh at all the rest of us
When you pull out like a compass weight
Frail
Sail
