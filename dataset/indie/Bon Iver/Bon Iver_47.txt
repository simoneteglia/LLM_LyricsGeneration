Well, you find the time
Don't you
For the Lord?
But can you find the time
Oh, can't pass it around?
Fever last too long
Fever's rashing on
There's no fountain in silver
How art?
How art?
How often ya gonna see now
Truly what ya cease to be
Will you adjust your scenery?
Well, you find the time donâ€™t you
For the Lord?
Keep it rational
Keep it rational
There's no fountain
