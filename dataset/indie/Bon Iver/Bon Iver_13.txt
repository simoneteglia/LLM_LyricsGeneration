[Verse 1]
I waited outside
I took it remote
I wanted a bath
"Tell the story or he goes"
"Tell the story or he goes"
[Chorus]
Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
[Verse 2]
I waited outside
I was tokin' on dope
I hoped it all wunt go in a minute
With the past that you know
I wanted all that mind sugar
I want it all mine
I had a heavy mind, sugar
I took it, it was right
[Chorus]
Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
[Interlude]
You're back and forth
You're back and forth
You go back and forth
And then you're back and forth
And back and forth
[Verse 3]
I waited outside
Then you took me in the room
And you offered up the truth
My eyes crawling up the window to the wall
From dusk 'til dawn
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em all
[Chorus]
Full time, you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time to call your Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well, you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light
