I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I think I'm coming down
I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I think I'm coming down
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
Please don't leave
Easy feeling
Don't leave me like that
Not yet
Don't set me free
Free
I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I've never been so high
I think I'm coming down
I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I've never laughed so loud
I think I'm coming down
Nothing gonna stop me now
Nothing gonna stop me now
