[Chorus]
Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!
Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!
[Verse]
And I
I'm the Carnival of Peace
I'll probably start a fleet
With no apologies
And the Carnival of Scenes
It grows more and more appealing
But my woman and I
My woman and I know what we're for
[Chorus]
Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!
Summer comes
To multiply
To multiply!
