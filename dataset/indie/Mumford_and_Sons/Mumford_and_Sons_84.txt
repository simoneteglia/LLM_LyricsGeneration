[Verse 1]
She sits him down in a stiff chair
Rubs his back and strokes his hair
Telling him, "It's okay to cry"
But he just sits and stares
The merciless moon outside
Has nothing, now he's come to realise
Only the desolation he feels
The cold distance inside
[Chorus]
But you and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning
You can get up if you want!
[Verse 2]
While the priest just sits and weeps
Lamenting the fact that he can see
Darkness and light in so much detail
He has given himself over
Refusing what he knows to be real
He turns away from every meal
Starving himself of goodness
He doesn't think he can heal
[Chorus]
But you and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning
Country Winston on the banjo!
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
"What if I lost all I had?"
Said the stranger to his dad
And the witness was confused
He can't tell what is bad
Instead, he runs up to the nearest girl
And he comments on her glorious curls
Says, "Darling come with me
I'll show you a whole new world"
[Chorus]
But you and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning
You and I now
We can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now
Though it's cold inside
Feel the tide turning
[Outro]
Thank you so much
