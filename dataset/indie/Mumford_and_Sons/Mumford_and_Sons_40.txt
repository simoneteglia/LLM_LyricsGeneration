[Verse 1]
My generation's stuck in the mirror
"Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word"
I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard
And I am afraid of that which I do not know
So why don't I just ask your
fucking
name?
Justice just gets buried in a white light
I heard there was a time you'd call it shame
[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here
[Verse 2]
Your cynicism buys me no more time here
Imagine my relief to hit the walls
Running from the weight of ancient labels
And leaving what identity there was
Well, my generation's stuck in the mirror
"Forget about the poor, 'cause I don't like the word"
And I need to know the name of my neighbor
I am not known if I'm not seen or heard
[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here
[Bridge]
Let's raise our hands for a moment
And leave it all behind
Don't be afraid for a moment
The blind leading the blind
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
So put your hands in mine tonight
And I will be here
When you're crying out tonight
I will be here
