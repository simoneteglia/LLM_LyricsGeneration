[Verse 1]
No more questions no more lies
Do a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
[Verse 2]
Waiting patient for the sun to rise
It reveals a stoic smile
But you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
[Chorus]
You'll find me waiting here for you
Come and suffer here
You'll find me holding my breath for you
Come and suffer here
[Verse 3]
In the violence of a mind's eye
We had a deal for no surprises
Cos you will never slip away
Slip away in the night
[Refrain]
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
[Chorus]
You'll find me holding my breath for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
You'll find me on my knees for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
[Break]
Go gently now
Be still
And love
Go gently now
Be still
And love
Go gently now
Be still
[Chorus]
You find me holding my breath for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
You'll find me on my knees for you
It's never more than I can take
I wouldn't have it any other way
[Outro]
But you're not yourself
I know you better than you
And you're not yourself
I know you better than you
