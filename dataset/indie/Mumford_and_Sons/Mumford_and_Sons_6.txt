[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
You hold it in your hands
And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again
Alone in the compromise of truth
[Chorus]
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you leave it open?
[Verse 2]
And the stakes remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That courses down my spine
To leave a love divine
Don't leave a love divine
It's a watertight excuse
[Chorus]
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
[Bridge]
How does the earth around your feet
Just slip away?
And the bandit will greet you in the night
With snake eyes
The most precious type
[Chorus]
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight
Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
[Instrumental Outro]
