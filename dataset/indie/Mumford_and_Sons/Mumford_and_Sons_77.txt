I might be apart of this
Ripple on water from a lonesome drip
A fallen tree that witness me
I'm alone
Him and me
The life its self can not aspire
To have someone be so admired
I threw creation to my kin
With the silence broken by a whispered wind
All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground
And root to root and tip to tip
I look at him my country chip
Let it up by all his fears
But someone brought you close to tears
Many trains and many miles
Like you to me on this sunny isle
And one of which you wish to speak
Have you come here to rescue me?
All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground
But I am keeper
And I hold your face away from light
I am yours till they come
I am yours till they come
