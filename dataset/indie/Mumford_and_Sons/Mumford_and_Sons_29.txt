[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside
[Verse 2]
See you told me that I would find a hole
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals
[Chorus]
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
[Verse 3]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But, you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home
That will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with the restart
[Chorus]
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
[Bridge]
Stars, hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul
Hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul
[Outro]
But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine
[Spoken outro]
