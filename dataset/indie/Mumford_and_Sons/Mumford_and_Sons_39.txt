[Verse 1]
Tell my thoughts to resign
And lift you from my mind
I'm not ready, I'm not strong enough
To cradle the weight of your love
Just take a minute, take a breath
Lay down your head on my sunken chest
I saw a flicker then just smoke
But as you left, I was calling your name at the night
[Chorus]
Thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
[Verse 2]
I thought we fell to the ground
I see you whimper with no sound
Open my mouth to breathe some words of peace
But the silence gives nothing back to me
So I'll be a shadow of the flame
I leant down to kiss you then erased my name
And I'll be a whisper on the wind
My hands are shaking from holding so tight for so long
[Bridge]
The flame burnt out in our empty hands
But now I see it's got nothing to do
It's got nothing to do with you
[Chorus]
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
I thought we were done
And young love would keep us young
[Outro]
(Why do I keep falling)
I thought we were done
(Why do I keep falling)
And young love would keep us young
(Why do I keep falling)
I thought we were done
(Why do I keep falling)
And young love would keep us young
