[Verse 1]
If I could tell you no
I thought it best you didn't know
Don't see it coming
The darkness visible
But when its eyes fix mine
It's silver and it's stone
I feel it rising, oh
The gathering storm
[Pre-Chorus]
And when I feel that darkness is a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to hide it
It's a heartbeat away
[Chorus]
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I picture you
[Verse 2]
And the night falls fast
I know it's heavy on the skin
Will it be ever thus
Barely visible
But when your eyes fix mine
Embracing your denial
Well I hold my breath
Through the waste and the wild
[Pre-Chorus]
When I feel it rising
And it's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
And now
You don't know me like this
It's a heartbeat away
And I
Don't know how to fight it
It's a heartbeat away
[Chorus]
And I picture you
Soaked in light
I picture you
And in you I have no doubt
When the chaos calls me out
And it feels like there is nothing I can do
I picture you
