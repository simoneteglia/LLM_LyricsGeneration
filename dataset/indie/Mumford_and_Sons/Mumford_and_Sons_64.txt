[Verse 1]
Wazuza moyo wanga ah
Tsiku lina n’zatopa
N’zapita kwa makol’anga
[Verse 2]
And I
Downtown head and high rise eyes
So naive to how the skyline lies
Must do nothing for your mind
[Chorus]
And I’ll love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't matter I'm cold
Doesn't matter I'm toothless
Doesn't matter my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you’ve landed
But a fool you call home
[Verse 3]
Eh, taona moyo wako iwe
Ulibe n’chisoni chomwe
Mtima wako n’wa chabe-chabe
[Verse 4]
And you
Amazed you held my gaze so long
With you're down-home heart and skirt undone
Stand by the man that you call home
[Chorus]
I know I love you now
But will I love you then?
You can see it in my eyes
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't matter I'm cold
Doesn't matter I'm toothless
Doesn't matter my heart is so suddenly useless
What a fool you’ve landed
But a fool you call home
[Outro]
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
Usandiyese, usanditole
Usandinyoze
