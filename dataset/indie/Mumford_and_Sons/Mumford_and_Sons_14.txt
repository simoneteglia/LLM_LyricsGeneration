[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Oh, babe, meet me in Tompkins Square Park
I wanna hold you in the dark
One last time
Just one last time
And oh, babe, can you tell what's on my tongue?
Can you guess that I'll be gone
With the twilight?
With the twilight
[Chorus]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No, they don't, they say they don't
[Verse 2]
And oh, babe, I've never been so lost
I wanna hear you laugh
One last time
Just one last time
But oh, babe, I really wish you would not cry
I only ever told you one lie
When it could have been a thousand
It might as well have been a thousand
[Chorus]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
No, they don't, they say they don't
And we can talk it 'round again, girl
'Round and 'round, 'round and 'round again
Or we could leave it out tonight
Leave it out, just leave it out
[Bridge]
I never tried to trick you, babe
I just tried to work it out
But I was swallowed up by doubt
If only things were black and white
'Cause I just wanna hold you tight
Without holding back my mind
Without holding back my mind
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
But no flame burns forever, oh no
You and I both know this all too well
And most don't even last the night
