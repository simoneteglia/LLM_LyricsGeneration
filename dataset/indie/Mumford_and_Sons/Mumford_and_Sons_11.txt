[Intro/Segue]
[Verse 1]
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbin' over something
And I'm runnin' through these walls
[Chorus]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're tryin' to say to me
[Verse 2]
I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been
[Chorus]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're tryin' to say to me
[Post-Chorus]
So open up my eyes, tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Say something, say something
Something like you love me
'Less you wanna move away
From the noise of this place
[Chorus]
Well, I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're tryin' to say to me
[Post-Chorus]
So open up my eyes, tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes, tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
