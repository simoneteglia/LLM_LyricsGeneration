[Verse 1]
You were cold
As the blood through your bones
And the light which led us
From our chosen homes
Well, I was lost
And now I sleep
Sleep the hours that I can't weep
When all I knew was steeped in blackened holes
I was lost, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm, hmm
[Chorus]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
[Verse 2]
And I was still
But I was under your spell
When I was told by Jesus, all was well
So all must be well
Just give me time
You know your desires and mine
So wrap my flesh in ivy and in twine
For I must be well
[Chorus]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Oh, keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
(Hey!)
[Bridge]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
[Chorus]
Keep the earth below my feet
For all my sweat, my blood runs weak
Let me learn from where I have been
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
Keep my eyes to serve, my hands to learn
[Outro]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Cheers, thank you very much!
