[Verse 1]
I... I can't promise you that I won't let you down
And I... I can't promise you that I will be the only one around
When your hope falls down
But we're young
Open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world
And love, this city breathes the plague of loving things more than
Their Creators
[Verse 2]
I ran away, I could not take the burden of both me and you
It was too fast, casting love on me as if it were a spell I could not break
When it was a promise I could not make
But if I was wrong? What if I was wrong?
Oh what if I was wrong?
[Chorus]
But hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
[Verse 3]
Now this land means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees
At every turn, the water runs away from me
The halo disappears, I'm not whole when you're not here
So what if I was wrong? What if I was wrong?
Oh what if I was wrong?
[Chorus]
But hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
[Outro]
Hold on to what you believed
In the light
