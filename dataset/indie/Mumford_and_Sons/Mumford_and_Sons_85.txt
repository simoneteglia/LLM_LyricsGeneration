[Intro]
(Crowd screams)
Well love was kind, for a time
But now just aches and it makes me blind
This mirror holds my eyes too bright
I can't see the others in my life
[Verse 1]
Were we too young?
Our heads too strong?
To bear the weight of these lover's eyes
'Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse of these lover's eyes
[Chorus]
But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord, forget all of my sins
Oh, let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lover's eyes
[Verse 2]
There's no drink nor drug I tried
To rid the curse of these lover's eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong
[Chorus]
But do not ask the price I pay
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord, forget all of my sins
Oh, let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lover's eyes
[Bridge]
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, I'll be on my way
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
[Instrumental]
[Outro]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
Hello everyone, so much for the show
