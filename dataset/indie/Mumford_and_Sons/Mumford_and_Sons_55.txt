[Intro in Chichewa]
[The Very Best in Chichewa]
[Mumford & Sons]
You search all your life
Stealing all you find
And you stare at your own hands
Not the hands they entwine
[The Very Best in Chichewa]
[Baaba Maal in Pulaar]
[The Very Best in Chichewa]
[Mumford & Sons]
You have all you need
When you're held by me
Don't pine for what's not
And whatever will be
You have all you need
When you're held by me
Don't pine for what's not
And whatever will be
[Outro in Chichewa]
