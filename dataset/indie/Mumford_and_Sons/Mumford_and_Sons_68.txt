[Verse 1]
Though I may speak some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength with which to speak
When you sit me down and see I’m weak
[Pre-Chorus]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams
And we’ll be free
[Chorus]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams
And we’ll be free
We will be who we are
And they’ll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
[Verse 2]
So I had done wrong
But you put me right
My judgement burned in the black of night
When I give less than I take
It is my fault, my own mistake
[Chorus]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
We’ll fulfill our dreams
And we’ll be free
We will be who we are
And they’ll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
