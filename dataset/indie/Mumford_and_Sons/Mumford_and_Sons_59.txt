And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over
I had done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again
[Hook]
But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light
Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward
I know I've tried
I was not stable
Flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up
--
breathe in, breathe out
[Hook]
And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
You may not trust the promises
Of the change I'll show
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine
[Hook] x2
