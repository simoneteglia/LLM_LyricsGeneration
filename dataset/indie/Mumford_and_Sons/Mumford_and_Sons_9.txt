[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
It's in my blood, it's in my water
You tried to tame me, tame me from the start
With that deadness in your eye, flash your flesh
Desperate for a need to rise
[Pre-Chorus]
With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
In the place that's safe from harm
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind
[Chorus]
You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love
If you want
[Verse 2]
Beholden now, I find myself awake
Waiting on the edge again
You sleep so sound with your mind made up
Drinking from your cup of broken ends
[Pre-Chorus]
With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
In the place that's safe from harm
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind
[Chorus]
You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love
If you want
[Outro]
But I thought we believed
In an endless love
But I thought we believed
In an endless love
