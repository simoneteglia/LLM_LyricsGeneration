There's a chip on your shoulder, girl
And by God it'll make you fall
If you let it take a part of your soul
I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister, don't test the ones you love
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
'Cause your roots will rot away
And your fruit, it won't grow
Your bark will wear thin, body hollow
I see the love in your brother's eyes
And the love in your mother's cries
Sister, don't test the ones you love
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Don't test the ones you love
It'll only tear us down
If you want to feel alive
Then learn to love your ground
Don't test the ones you love
It'll only tear us down
If you want to feel alive
Then learn to love your ground
Love your ground
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
Sister, don't let go
Sister, don't let go of us
