[Verse 1]
Do not lie to us
Don't hide your eyes from us
I will take this offered cup
I will sit upon your floor
Tell your stories, tell of your pain
That's what I came here for
And your children come and go as you weep
[Verse 2]
But what have I if I have not love?
I am a waste
My words are empty vessels if I do nothing in this place
And we can scream into the shadows
And it's good that we can
But walk with me I think we'll find a way
And walk with me I think we'll find a way
[Verse 3]
But I'll meet you at the delta
Where the rivers run into the sea
And I'll meet you at the delta
What's behind, I can clearly see
But that beyond, that's beyond me
[Chorus]
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
And does your love prefer the other?
And does your love just make you feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
[Verse 4]
When it's all just dust to dust
And that's how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
When it's all just dust to dust
And how it will be
When it's all just nothingness
That means nothing to me
[Pre-Chorus]
Does my love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
Does my love prefer the other?
Or does my love just make me feel good?
[Chorus]
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
When it feels like nothing else matters
Will you put your arms around me?
Does your love prefer the other?
Does my love just make me feel good?
