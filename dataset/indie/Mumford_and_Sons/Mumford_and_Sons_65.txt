[Verse 1: Gang of Youths]
Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you'll hear your sister sleep-talking
Saying, "Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
Oh, but your beard
Someday might be"
And she'll wake up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
She'll lay it aside
[Verse 2: Mumford & Sons]
Older father, weary soul, you drive
Out to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
The papers for divorce and a lonely ring
Lonely ring
Sit on your porch
Pluck your strings
And you'll find somebody you can blame
And you'll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you'll find the peace of the Lord
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3: Gang of Youths,
with Mumford & Sons
]
Grandfather, weary soul, you'll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You've waited for forever and a day
Oh, just to die
But someday soon
You will die
Oh, the only woman you ever loved
She got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread
It ran into her body and her blood
And there's nothing that you can do about it now
[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
