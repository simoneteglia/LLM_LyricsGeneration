I came home, like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
So break my step, and relent
You forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way shake the excess
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
I'll kneel down, know my ground
Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
Use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, free from the lies
And I'll kneel down, wait for now
I'll kneel down, know my ground
I'll kneel down, wait for now
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
