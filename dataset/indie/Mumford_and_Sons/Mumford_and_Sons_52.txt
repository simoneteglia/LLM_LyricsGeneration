There to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night
Rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded, though immortal: But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:
At once, as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all: but torture without end
Still urges
As one great furnace flamed, yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible
