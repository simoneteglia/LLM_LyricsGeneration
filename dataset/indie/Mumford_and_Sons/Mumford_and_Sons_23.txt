Where do I turn to when there's no choice to make?
How do I presume when there's so much at stake?
I was so sure of it all
What if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
If this is our last hope
We would see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
Well I've been running from the ashes we left
Forgiveness begs for itself but how can I forget
There's a stain on it all
But what if I need you in my darkest hour?
What if it turns out there is no other?
We had it all
If this is our time now
We wanna see a sign, oh
We would see a sign
So give us a sign
I need some guiding light
Children of darkness, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
