In the silver light
I just made out
Your silhouette
Through the quickening haze
So brand it on my mind
So I don't forget
Let it shine
By wandering eyes
Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have faith for the
rest
I'm blinded by the lights
Of October Skies
These postcard memories
Evade my eyes
And in the valley I am free
But in the hills I soar
Until your silhouette
Is gone once more
Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have hope once more
The fear of what's to come
Has been crippling me
So to your silhouette
I turn once more
So brand it on my mind
So I won't forget
Let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Oh let it shine, let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Oooh, your love endures
Oooh, I have hope once more
