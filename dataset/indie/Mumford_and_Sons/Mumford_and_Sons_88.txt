[Intro]
You want that?
[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
Together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
You told me that I would find a home
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals
(Hey!)
[Chorus]
And "Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
[Verse 3]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home that'll change this heart
But the welcome I receive with every start
(Yeah!)
[Chorus]
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
(Yeah)
Stars hide your fires
For these here are my desires
And I won't give them up to you this time around
And so I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking the territory of this newly impassioned soul, oh!
[Outro]
But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine
Thank you very much!
