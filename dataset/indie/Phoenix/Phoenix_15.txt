[Intro - Sigh]
Ah
[Verse 1]
Something in the middle of the side of the store
Got your attention when I asked for more
I was excited to be part of your world
To belong, to be loved, to be mostly the two of us
Something I was stealing for no reason at all
They hang me higher than a disco ball
But you talked, I'm gonna let you go
It's the Picasso, Michelangelo
Something 'bout the jewels you wear
Shiny, shiny bangles on your wrists
And at the masquerade ball
You feel trapped in a vault, in an empty aquarium
Suddenly you're out of the woods
Inside of an alley, you're out of words
Well, I thought it was radium at first
[Chorus]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
There's no else to blame for us two
[Verse 2]
Something that don't matter till they matter to you
They stole that money from a homeless girl
The truth, we're all to blame their lies and moral consequences
We started at the end of the line
To end up giving up to a couple, who cares?
When you talked me into letting you go
No more coral on the atoll
Something about how hard you learned
Kamikaze in a hopeless world
Do you remember the last time you laughed and then laughed and you lived to the laugh?
Turn me on the lonely on the side of the world
With a couple of guys and no alphabet
Put two and two together
We'll make it last forever
[Chorus]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
There's no else to blame for us two
[Vocalized Breakdown]
[Outro]
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
Is it so bad?
Is it so true?
Is it still you?
Just because of you
These things I have to go through
It's more than I'll change
There's no else to blame for us two
