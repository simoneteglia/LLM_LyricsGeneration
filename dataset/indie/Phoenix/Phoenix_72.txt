[Verse 1]
You’re reaching out to me again
I’ll turn my back and
Try to ignore the words
Your helping hand
When I’m not listening
I will never find a way to break
The mask you wear
If you still hesitate
Still you're waiting for the rain
When have you become
A mirror of someone
[Bridge]
Strike a match
See if you make it through the fire
Let it burn
Let it take you higher
[Chorus]
You won’t get out unhurt
And it’s down to you to
Make the tables turn
The tables turn
(The tables turn)
[Verse 2]
Deep inside I know you’re right
The truth in your words
Still I can’t bring myself
To take a leap
Of faith on purpose
There will always be a way to break
The mask you wear
But you still hesitate
Be the one to fly above the masses
Be the phoenix rising from the ashes
[Bridge]
Strike a match
See if you make it through the fire
Let it burn
Let it take you higher
[Chorus]
You won’t get out unhurt
And it’s down to you to
Make the tables turn
The tables turn
(The tables turn)
[Verse 3]
As I heard
Your silence
Turned my head
Seeing you crawling
Crawling
You made me feel life
Pulled the darkness aside
You’ve been building up a feeling
Falling far behind
(Yeah!)
You fell behind
[Bridge]
Strike a match
See if you make it through the fire
Let it burn
Let it take you higher
[Chorus]
You won’t get out unhurt
And it’s down to you to
Make the tables turn
The tables turn
[Verse 4]
Your words
They made me feel life
(Make me feel life)
Pulled the darkness aside
(Darkness aside)
You’ve been building up a feeling
Falling so far behind
