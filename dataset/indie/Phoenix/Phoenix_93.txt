[Verse 1]
Some of you lost, some of you with attitude
Many have laughed to summon you
So many ways, trying to show them gratitude
Better butcher their lies, till you hear them too
Soon you'll learn where to find me, how to look
Unexposed and no residue
So figure it fast, are you hope or vanity?
Now d'you think you're ready to say no no no?
[Pre-Chorus]
Terrorizing your neighbor
I'm a Siberian tiger
I'll always be an outsider
Don't neglect me
Fleur de Lys
[Chorus]
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
[Verse 2]
Hear me roar from the south pavilion
My fingers crossed, watch her debut
Pretty in rags, I'm the one civilian
Why bother your rise, do you feel it too?
Soon you'll learn, falling down the pedestal
Who's your favorite son and your favorite tune
So figure it fast, is it hope or gravity?
Don't think to tell me to let go go go
[Pre-Chorus]
Terrorizing your neighbor
I'm a Siberian tiger
I'll always be an outsider
Don't neglect me Fleur de Lys
[Chorus]
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
[Interlude]
"Je t'ai laissé un message
Est-ce que tu l'as reçu?
J'ai vraiment besoin qu'on se parle
Je ne fais rien demain soir
Mais je ne sais pas si tu dois venir me voir"
[Outro]
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest till I get to you
No!
No rest till I get to you, no rest, no rest, no rest for me
