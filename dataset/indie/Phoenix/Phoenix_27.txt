Tools all in my coupe
All of them shoot
Bullets they coming at you
You niggas you running your mouth
I run in your house
Show you what my .30 about
I'm banging out

Bullets we talk
Try me you're pressing your luck
I be in the streets
.40 so motherfucking fat it will sweep you off your feet
I'm in the trap, I don't trust a soul
So I watch my back
So fucking stacked
Niggas talking shit about my brother Jack (R.I.P.)
I pull up on you, where ya at?
Glocks gave you heart attack

To count up my guap

Count up the bands (Countin' all these bands!)

And unload the shit (Right now)
