I don't trust a soul but I trust my pole
AK with the scope pointed at your nose
Cut a bitch off, you know how it goes (Ayy, let's get it)
D Savage stay flexing for the hoes (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Two cups filled up
Sake World, don't give a fuck (What? What?)
Chopper got a lot of buck (What? What?)
Bitch, I walk fully tucked (What? What?)
Better duck, ayy
Sake World forever, bitch
Damn, we done made it, shit

Lake came and fucked them niggas
Pull up and we pop at niggas
Let off thirty shots at niggas
Weej fuckin' droppin' niggas
[Verse 2: Yung Weej]
Bitch, I'm reppin Sake World, Sake, Sake, Sake
Rollin' up a hundred sack in the booth, smokin' loud
Sipping on that sake slow as fuck like I'm sippin' mud
Weej and D Savage pull up in a Maserati, what's really good?
Fuck the Swishers and Dutches, I only smoke 'Woods
I'm in a Range Rover with D Savage and we be whippin' shit
Don't be talkin' shit on Twitter if you're not with the shit
Sake World, we shootin' shit
Fuck Lake World, they ain't with the shit
[Chorus: D Savage 3900]
