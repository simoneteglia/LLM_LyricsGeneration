[Verse 1]
You could do it better,
Drakkar Noir
Cheap fixtures, religious tales
Light a cigarette for two, you're too close to get to
How come everyone knows you before they meet you?
[Chorus]
In the jangle jungle
Jingle junkie, juggle, juggle me
A better standard than mediocre
I watch you tumble, oh-oh-oh-oh
Jangle jungle
Jingle, jump before you stumble
I'm just too glad to say no
Just too glad to say no, oh-oh-oh, no, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
Scandinavian leather,
Drakkar Noir
Fake riches, oblivious tales
On a domestic airline
Swear to God that you're mine
[Chorus]
In the jangle jungle
Jingle junkie, juggle, juggle me
A better standard than mediocre
I watch you tumble, oh-oh-oh-oh
Jangle jungle
Jingle, jump before you stumble
I'm just too sad to say no
Just too glad to say no, oh-oh-oh, no, oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
How I wish I knew you
How I wish I knew you from before
'Til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die
Run the avenues, until the city unfolds
Why would we have to know?
Do we have to know what truth is?
Why I wish I knew you
Why I wish I knew you from before
'Til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die, 'til I die
I'm just too glad to say no
Just too glad to say no, oh-oh-oh, no, oh-oh-oh
No, oh-oh-oh, no, oh-oh-oh
