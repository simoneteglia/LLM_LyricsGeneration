Ayy, hey
[Chorus]
Tell me, what you tryna do (Do), wanna do
It's just me and you (You), me and you
Come to my room, to my room
It’s just me and you, what you tryna do?
What you tryna do?
In my coupe with no roof, me and you
Tell me, what you tryna do?
What you tryna do? What you tryna do?
Come to my room, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
What you tryna do? I got hundreds in the bank (Oh-oh)
Smokin' OG gas in the trap and it stank (Oh)
I can't trust nobody so I stay in my own lane (Oh)
Got a new girl and she so fine (Hey)
Girl, go roll some weed, baby, ease your mind
She like, "Why you gotta go? Leavin’ me behind" (Ayy, uh)
I was so depressed ('Pressed), then I got a check
50 bands, 100 bands, baby, I'ma thumb through it
If I catch a opp with my gun then I'm gon' shoot it
Booted off the— (Grrt) I'm so high, think I miss you
Walk a nigga down, no drive-by, I won't miss you (Uh, uh)
I'm in my zone, I’m in my zone (Uh)
I get too high ’cause I'm tired of bein’ alone (Uh)
Been a couple months since you called my phone (Uh, uh)
Love it when she FaceTime with no clothes on (Ayy)
I think that I fell in love, what is goin' on? (Ayy)
Tell me if I'm trippin', can you hear me out? (Ayy)
I just bought a chopper with a hundred rounds (Ooh)
Let me catch a opp, I’ma gun him down, yeah
[Chorus]
Tell me, what you tryna do (Do), wanna do
It's just me and you (You), me and you
Come to my room, to my room
It's just me and you, what you tryna do?
What you tryna do?
In my coupe with no roof, me and you
Tell me, what you tryna do?
What you tryna do? What you tryna do?
Come to my room, oh, oh (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
With my nigga T smokin' out the pound, yeah (Yeah)
Cookies and OG, yeah, that's all we want, yeah (Yeah)
Gettin' to the cake like my birthday (Ayy)
You wish you could be me on my worst day
Snuck my (Grr) in in this fuckin' function (Oh yeah)
Two cups, filled up, yeah, that is my potion
Rob me, good, luck, I be on that fuck shit (Oh yeah)
Four-five, keep it tucked, you don't even know
[Chorus]
Tell me, what you tryna do? Wanna do
It's just me and you, me and you
Come to my room, to my room
It's just me and you, what you tryna do?
What you tryna do?
In my coupe with no roof, me and you
Tell me, what you tryna do?
What you tryna do? What you tryna do?
Oh
