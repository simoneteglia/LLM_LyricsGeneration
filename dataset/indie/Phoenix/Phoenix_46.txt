[Verse]
I talked to Satan in my sleep, I think he fuck wit me
Cause I'm a demon emotionless when I'm off the lean
I came from nothing to something my mama proud of me
No more depression, I'm flexing upon my enemies
I can't even go to sleep, cause my shadows after me
I been jugging robbing niggas all day all week
Make an example of these niggas cause these fuck niggas weak
There go savage with that heat, I know Satan after me
Blood my whole gang hungry and you food so let's eat
How could you cross me? How could you cross me?
I can't believe ya, we tried to help ya
Duckin' and dodgin', y'all camouflagin' under the radar
Y'all some pussy niggas
