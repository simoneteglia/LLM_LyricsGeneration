[Chorus]
Yeah, uh
I just seen the opps, finna pop 'em like a pill
MONY POWR RSPT, boy, this shit too real
Bitch, I’m in the trap beating pots with a deal
Got a new pint, finna crack me a seal
Everywhere I go gotta keep me a steel
Bae, I'm too high, finna crash, take the wheel
Everywhere that I go gotta keep a Draco
Shoot it if I say so
I get them bags in for the low
I got a freak bitch, touch your toes
If I go broke I'm kicking down doors
Tell them niggas lay low
[Verse 1]
It’s 3 AM, why you calling?
'Cause a young nigga keep on balling
And you know I got a stick in the party
Got a strap and it's velcroed on me
Gas, lean, on me
Choppa folds on me
Young nigga shit in the stu, when I'm cooking up
Niggas ain't fucking with the mob, ain't good enough
Pull up to the strip club and I'm finna fuck it up
Big racks on me, with a big Glock 40
Talking that tough shit, gotta show me
Busting the brick down with the homies
Kick in your door if a nigga owe me
[Chorus]
Yeah, uh
I just seen the opps, finna pop 'em like a pill
MONY POWR RSPT, boy, this shit too real
Bitch, I’m in the trap beating pots with a deal
Got a new pint, finna crack me a seal
Everywhere I go gotta keep me a steel
Bae, I’m too high, finna crash, take the wheel
Everywhere that I go gotta keep a Draco
Shoot it if I say so
I get them bags in for the low
I got a freak bitch, touch your toes
If I go broke I'm kicking down doors
Tell them niggas lay low
[Verse 2]
Uh, I’m twerkin
' my wrist when I mix it
I'm flexin' like I’m at the finish
And bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
I told her, "Hold up, let me finish"
I'm workin' like I'm independent
Twenty thousand for the pendant
You think that it's easy? It's not, uh
Pullin' up in a new drop
These niggas be cappin' a lot
Pull out that (Brrrt), bodies gon' drop
Who's talkin' 'bout knots? I got a lot
Needin' some crack? It's 'bout to drop
I got some (Brrrt), it's 'bout to lock
Kick in yo' door, all in yo' spot
[Chorus]
Yeah, uh
I just seen the opps, finna pop 'em like a pill
MONY POWR RSPT, boy, this shit too real
Bitch, I'm in the trap beating pots with a deal
Got a new pint, finna crack me a seal
Everywhere I go gotta keep me a steel
Bae, I'm too high, finna crash, take the wheel
Everywhere that I go gotta keep a Draco
Shoot it if I say so
I get them bags in for the low
I got a freak bitch, touch your toes
If I go broke I'm kicking down doors
Tell them niggas lay low
