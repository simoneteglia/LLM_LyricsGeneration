[Part I]
[Instrumental]
[Part II]
[Chorus]
Justice done
[Verse 1]
People in fashion, rattle, don't hesitate
A look of my own, your chances are slim
Victory lap, formal with feathery eyes
Dating vendetta, win small, spray pesticide
[Chorus]
Justice done
[Verse 2]
Caledonian, rich and young,
self-entitled portrait
Court in session, justice done,
we'll rush into it anyway
Forever is for everyone else,
we’re off a couple secrets
Another lonely Tuesday home, stolen kisses, is anyone near?
Caledonian, rich and young,
self-entitled portrait
Court in session, justice done,
we'll rush into it anyway
Forever is for everyone else,
we’re off a couple secrets
Another lonely Tuesday home, stolen kisses, is anyone near?
Caledonian, rich and young,
self-entitled portrait
Court in session
[Chorus]
Justice done
