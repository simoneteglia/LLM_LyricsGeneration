[Verse 1]
They say that you don't
You promised you will
I'm calling my number
To sort out the thrill
Almost, almost, almost the real thing
How could I have missed that one?
How could I have missed it?
Am I the only one?
Your Lancelot
Twenty-year-old and bored
Run for a better future
[Pre-Chorus]
Pour lava in the ocean
Drown into the throne that you sit on
Follow, follow, follow me
Holy Father and Son
It's odd enough for you to live on
So long, so long, Salomé
[Chorus]
Tell me that's what you wanted (Follow)
Follow, follow me, follow me
Follow, follow me, follow me
[Verse 2]
You're more than I want
I figured you will
Back in September
We'll make it a deal
Almost, almost, almost the real thing
How could I have missed that one?
How could I have missed it?
Am I the only one?
Your Lancelot
Twenty years, often bored
Run for a better future
[Pre-Chorus]
Pour lava in the ocean
Turn the eternal carousel on
Follow, follow, follow me
Holy Father and Son
It's odd enough for you to live on
So long, so long, Salomé
[Chorus]
Tell me that's what you wanted (Follow)
Follow, follow me, follow me
Follow, follow me, follow me
Follow, follow me, follow me
