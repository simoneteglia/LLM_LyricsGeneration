[Verse 1]
Just don't bother
Don't feed the animals, don't let them run in circles
Don't be told
It just don't matter
It just don't matter if you're more than ready, run away
From dusk 'til dawn
[Verse 2]
Last night on the couch, you're livid
It's a poor complaint
It's the only thing, you're sad and underweight
Whatever, we're so close to serious
Whatever promise you made
I have no problem to say no
[Chorus]
I'll never know
I'll never know
I'll never know you
Restrained
Reach out for me
I'll never know you if you don't
[Verse 3]
It's just another
It's just another complicated case
To settle down the road
Whatever, we're too close to serious
Whatever promise you made
From dusk 'til dawn
[Verse 4]
Don't swear that it is your fault
You're sophisticated
I saw the chandelier, I'm foreign and under stress
Whatever, we're too close to serious
Whatever comments you make
I hear them rattle to say no
[Chorus]
I'll never know
I'll never know
I'll never know you
Restrained
Reach out for me
I'll never know you if you don't
