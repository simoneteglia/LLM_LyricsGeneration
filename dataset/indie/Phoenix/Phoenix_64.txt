[Intro: KEY!]
Two-tone diamonds 'bout to blind everybody (Blind everybody)
And your girl, she hooked on phonics (Yeah)
'Cause she do whatever I say, ayy (Do whatever I say)
Money don't solve my problems (My problems)
But I'm doin' good, I (
James Delgado!
)
[Chorus: Guapdad 4000]
Ayy, stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the bank
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the bank
Stealin', stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the bank
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the— Huh? (
Take it all
)
Stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that bank
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that bank
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that bank
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that— (Yeah, ayy)
[Verse 1: Guapdad 4000]
I come from Psycho's and I'm finna be that way
When I unlock all my chakra, bruh, my enemies gon' pray
When these fuckboys gon' come try and it's finna be that day
Got this beautiful woman with me and she finna be that bae
She said that pussy taste like ice cream and I'm finna eat sorbet
If my brother got that chopper, bet his enemies on skates
Yamaguchi, my wrist frosty, my mind, I almost lost it
My main bitch got that test back so she know that she ain't caught shit
We just bought shit, she just talk shit (Ayy)
My nigga Dee be off shit (Yeah)
That chopper love to sing, but shit, sometimes it just be talking, ayy
Fuck that little bitch, she a catfish
Feeling like JID, never had shit, had to grab shit, had to swipe shit
Had a white bitch with a wide trick
Pulling all the bitches every time he would pipe it (Yeah)
Call up Zay, know he tote, he gon' spray
All his foes better stay on them toes, in the bank
At the shows with the crows and the clout fucking hoes
Bustin' down with the bros in the Bay, we gon' stay, always
[Chorus: Guapdad 4000 &
Maxo Kream

Stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the bank
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the bank
Stealin', stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the bank
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out the— Huh?
(Stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that bank)
(Stealin', stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that bank)
Maxo, Maxo, Maxo

Whoa, Kenny!

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream &
Guapdad 4000
]
Whoa like Kenny, mix the dro with the Henny
I be sellin' flapjacks like IHOP, Denny's
I'ma scam a nigga dough,
Hardaway for the penny
Screamin' "Fuck the popo" 'til the law come get me
Whoa like Kenny, mix the dro with the Henny
I be sellin' flapjacks like IHOP, Denny's
I'ma scam a nigga dough, Hardaway for the penny
Screamin', "Fuck the popo" 'til the law come get me
I'm sorry, Your Honor, huh
Persona my posture, my etiquette proper
Flippin' the drop, uh-huh (Oh, what?)
Convertible dropper, it came with a choppa
Write me a script when I go to the doctor
Servin' new J's like I work at Foot Locker
Fuck on her face and I empty her wallet
Took it to Chase to withdraw a deposit
I can't love that ho 'cause that lil' bitch be boppin'
Water VVs, it came from the faucet
CVVs, we 'bout to go shoppin'
High-Tech lean, pints out the closet
Whoa like Kenny, mix the dro with the Henny
I be sellin' flapjacks like IHOP, Denny's
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that bank
(Maxo, Maxo, Maxo, ayy)
[Verse 3: Denzel Curry &

Why the fuck I need a loan for police to leave me alone?
Once you makin' provolone, they think you sellin' from your home
Motherfuck these maricóns, excuse me, I'm not bashin' shit
I open safes like open sesame now there ain't no cash in it
Crash the whip like I'm Crash Bandicoot then get my bands a coupe
Bands are blue from what they hand to you, my guap is tangible
Sayin' to you, "My shit's phenomenal, I'm a phenomenon"
Back in the days, my boys was starvin' and it wasn't Ramadan
Octagon, if it's about my feet then the boy get dropped
If it's paper over pussy, best believe everything gon' pop
When I walk into the building now, it's open the close-up shop
When I— (
I was stealin' all the motherfuckin' money out that bank
)
Ashley Banks, Carlton Banks, Hilary Banks robbin' a bank
Outta your league, outta your rank, wanna be us but niggas can't
I know your girl, she just a skank, you got a gun, I got a tank
All this shit random but I gotta thank
All of my niggas for breakin' the bank, bitch
