[Verse 1]
Well, I really got to go now
Phoney as in "You're not just anyone"
Even though we're not supposed to
I would rather be too close to if anything
Is it a false alarm, another one?
[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
[Chorus]
Crystal or Bamboo
Voyageur Canoe
Crystal or Bamboo
Do you need another one?
Someone to talk to?
Put my name on your list
S.O.S. in Bel Air
[Verse 2]
When tired, you're no fun
When idols are boredom to everyone
When every piece of every costume
Is stolen, missing, I recall the pretty things
Is it the last of me or lesson one?
[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
Alone, alone, alone
(And you can't cross the line but you can't stop trying)
[Chorus]
Crystal or Bamboo
Voyageur Canoe
Crystal or Bamboo
Do you need another one?
Someone to talk to?
Put my name on your list
S.O.S. in Bel Air
