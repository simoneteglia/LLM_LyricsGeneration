[Verse 1]
Darling, you never know
It started years ago
When you're less than kind of done
An adolescent singing out real loud
Some wild English tune
Sing, "Sha-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us
When your time's up
[Verse 2]
How it all began
Seriously dumb
When you're less than kind of certain
An adolescent calling out real loud
It's what singers do
Sing, "Sha-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us
When your time's up
[Pre-Chorus]
You bet your life on a cruise ship, bartending crucial lies
We're destined, wise, and we socialize
[Chorus]
Bourgeois, why would you care for more?
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
Bourgeois, your fire's a false alarm
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
[Verse 3]
Darling, you'll never know
Darling, you'll never know
When you're less than kind of done
Adolescence looking at you now
Like foreign legions do
Sing, "Sha-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us when your time's up
[Pre-Chorus]
You lost your mind on a cruise ship, bartending crucial lies
We're destined, wise, and we socialize
[Chorus]
Bourgeois, why would you care for more?
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
Bourgeois, your fire's a false alarm
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
Bourgeois, why would you care for more?
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
Bourgeois, your fire's a false alarm
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
