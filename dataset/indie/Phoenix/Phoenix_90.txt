[Chorus]
You told me you love me
I said it back, I didn't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
A phoenix
[Verse 1]
You've been worried about me
A tornado inside
I've been complicated
Take a second to show me
How to burn and to rise
I could swear I'm changing
[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't very happy
When you met me, baby boy (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Chorus]
You told me you love me
I said it back, I didn't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
A phoenix
[Verse 2]
I know I haven't called back
But I'm building it up
Slowly, baby, surely
You're the first one I'll contact
When I feel good еnough
You don't have to worry
[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't very happy
When you mеt me, baby boy (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Chorus]
You told me you love me
I said it back, I didn't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
You told me you love me
I said it back, I didn't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
[Bridge]
I thought I meant to when I came in this relationship
But all the roses in the world would only fuel my rage
And now you're wounded from the blaze, I hope you can forgive
And we can rise from the ashes just like a phoenix
I'm burning alive, for us to survive
It's been complicated
Ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
You told me you love me
I said it back, I didn't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
You told me you love me
I said it back, I didn't mean it
I had to burn everything that I was
Just to come back like a phoenix
[Outro]
I thought I meant to when I came in this relationship
But all the roses in the world would only fuel my rage
And now you're wounded from the blaze, I hope you can forgive
So we can rise from the ashes just like a phoenix
A phoenix
