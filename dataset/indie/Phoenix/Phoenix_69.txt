[Intro]
Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you stranger
(Trap-A-Holics)
(Trill trap shit)
Ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy, yeah
Ayy, woah, woo, ayy, yeah, woo
Ayy, uh, uh, uh
(This is a certified hood classic)
What, ayy, yeah, ayy, what
Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Hit 'em with the stick, hit 'em with the pump
Watch his body flip, we don't give a shit
You know how I rock, loadin' up the clip
Pull up on yo' block, we don't give a fuck, we gon' shoot it up
Snuck into the club, you know I'm toolied up
Someone please point out the pussy niggas, who tough?
I want all the smoke, I don't give a fuck
[Verse]
Oh shit, goddamn
I'm a real nigga, ain't nothin' like them
Know what's up, no, we not friends
Pull off in the fast car, pull off in the Benz
Does she love me? Does she love me?
Yo ho love to scream my name when she fuck me
Bust down diamonds on my chain, lookin' lovely
If you lookin' for the kid, come find me
I ain't runnin' 'round, lil boy, I ain't hidin'
Throw a deuce, no peace, love the violence
I'm Gardena's best, I'm the finest
Your bitch tryna give me neck, she see them diamonds
[Chorus]
Hit 'em with the stick, hit 'em with the pump
Watch his body flip, we don't give a shit
You know how I rock, loadin' up the clip
Pull up on yo block, we don't give a fuck, we gon' shoot it up
Snuck into the club, you know I'm toolied up
Someone please point out the pussy niggas, who tough?
I want all the smoke, I don't give a fuck
