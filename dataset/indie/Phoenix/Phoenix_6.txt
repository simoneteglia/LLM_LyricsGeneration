[Verse 1]
Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present, they don't matter, now the future's sorted out
Watch her moving in elliptical patterns
Think it's not what you say, what you say is way too complicated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out
[Chorus]
It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
You're going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it over summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
It's not a miracle we needed
And no, I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
[Verse 2]
Girlfriend, oh, your girlfriend is drifting away
Past and present,
1855-1901
Watch them built up a material tower
Think it's not going to stay anyway, think it's overrated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out
[Chorus]
It's twenty seconds 'til the last call
You're going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
Lie down, you know it's easy
Like we did it over summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more
Going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
It's not a miracle we needed
No, I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
[Outro]
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
Fold it, fold it, fold it, fold it
