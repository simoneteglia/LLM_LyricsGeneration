[Intro]
(
Earl on the beat
)
Uh
[Chorus]
Spend a check on some diamonds, uh
In the trap lowkey, but my neck keep shining, ayy
I'ma keep on grindin', uh (Ayy)
Niggas hatin' on me but I really don't mind it
And I just chopped the top off the coupe (Ayy)
If I catch me a opp, I'ma shoot (Ayy)
Her pussy trash, loose
How does it feel to be you? Uh (Ayy)
[Post-Chorus]
How does it feel to be rich?
How does it feel to be used?
Oh, I promise I'm not being rude (No)
But right now I'm not fucking with you (No)
I'm just bickin' back, bein' bool
I get in that pussy, it's wet like a pool
She sucking that dick and it's makin' her drool
I'm smoking on 'thrax, I don't fuck with a Juul
If niggas want war then I'm calling the troops
[Verse 1]
In the traphouse cooking up bricks
Feel like SahBabii, I pull up with sticks
Niggas keep talking, get slapped like a bitch
I'm shooting my shot, and no, I won't miss
Stick dick in your bitch and she said it's too big
MONY POWR RSPT, 20 gang in this bitch
Niggas act tough and get sprayed in this bitch
You fucked up my shoes, got blood on my kicks, damn, uh
[Chorus]
Spend a check on some diamonds, uh
In the trap lowkey, but my neck keep shining, ayy
I'ma keep on grindin', uh (Ayy)
Niggas hatin' on me but I really don't mind it
And I just chopped the top off the coupe (Ayy)
If I catch me a opp, I'ma shoot (Ayy)
Her pussy trash, loose
How does it feel to be you? Uh (Ayy)
[Verse 2]
In the traphouse fuckin' it up
Slide with Junebug and we spray your shit up
Thought I saw 12 but I don't give a fuck
We just focused on running it up, ayy
I got hundreds, I'm throwin' it up
Just bought me some pressure, I'm rollin' it up (Rollin')
Just poured me some extra, I'm pourin' it up
The AK is Russian, I'm loadin' it up, ayy
I told my niggas, "Stay down for this shit" (Ayy)
When I'm out slidin' you know I won't miss (Ayy)
Beat up the pot when I'm twerking my wrist
Niggas ain't have it, they cappin' this shit
I can do magic when I flip the brick
I got locked for a Glock, tell the judge, "
Suck a dick"
That pussy outstanding, but I can't fit
Double cup in the Phantom, I'm swervin' and shit (Pssh, pssh)
[Chorus]
Spend a check on some diamonds, uh
In the trap lowkey, but my neck keep shining, ayy
I'ma keep on grindin', uh (Ayy)
Niggas hatin' on me but I really don't mind it
And I just chopped the top off the coupe (Ayy)
If I catch me a opp, I'ma shoot (Ayy)
Her pussy trash, loose
How does it feel to be you? Uh (Ayy)
[Post-Chorus]
How does it feel to be rich?
How does it feel to be used?
Oh, I promise I'm not being rude (No)
But right now I'm not fucking with you (No)
I'm just bickin' back, bein' bool
I get in that pussy, it's wet like a pool
She sucking that dick and it's makin' her drool
I'm smoking on 'thrax, I don't fuck with a Juul
If niggas want war then I'm calling the troops
[Outro]
Ya bitch
