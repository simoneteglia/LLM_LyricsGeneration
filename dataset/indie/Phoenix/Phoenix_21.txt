[Intro]
Let me tell you what it is
Do you mind if I do?
I know I can be honest with you
'Cause I don't like it as it is
[Verse 1]
I don't like it as it is
A disaster scenario
So don't look at what you did
This melted
gelato
Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
It's not love but wait
[Verse 2]
I'll be standing by the jukebox
Champagne or Prosecco?
I was playing classics by the
Buzzcocks
Battiato and Lucio
Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
Open up your legs
[Chorus]
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
I'll say Ti amo till we get along
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
I'll say Ti amo till we get along
[Verse 3]
You don't mind it as it is
Bonanza, che bello!
Well I'll show you how to win
My festival di Sanremo
Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
It's not over yet
[Verse 4]
Now I'm looking like the bad cop
Sunbathing in Rio
Switching unsophisticated soft rock
To Beethoven's Concerto
Love you! Ti amo! Je t'aime! ¡Te quiero!
Open up your legs
[Chorus]
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
I'll say Ti amo till we get along
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no no
Don't tell me, don't tell me no
I'll say Ti amo till we get along
[Outro]
Ça y est c'est fini
Je veux croire que le meilleur est à venir
Je sais que le pire l'est aussi
Alors laisse-moi compter les moutons
Chanter nos chansons, rêver à l'unisson
