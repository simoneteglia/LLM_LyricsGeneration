Tell me, tell me, tell me
What're you after?
Rush it, rush it, rush it
Who'd you root for?
You sounded so excited
What just happened?
If only boys around you
Would let you listen
Don't tell the broken-hearted
"That's what you get!"
I like the girls around you
But you went missing
D'you send the letter for the last tuition
Found the reason
You've been tossed around
I'm right behind you
Smash the castle down, delete it
Tuttifrutti, it's all on me
Wreck the spectacle you live in
Broken glass and porcelain
We'll be trashing motels
Tuttifrutti, it's all for free
Sell the gold, silverware
Burn the rest and melt with me
Show me, show me, show me
Tears or laughter
Don't hide it, hide it, hide it
It's too sinister
Come buy a ticket
To your next vacation
There's only one around you
That does the stitching
So call me, call me, call me
Back if you wait
Forget the mess behind you
Forgot the lesson?
Stop
What d'you with your lifetime?
It's only protocol
"If I can do it, you can do it"
Smash the castle down, delete it
Tuttifrutti, it's all on me
Wreck the spectacle you live in
Broken glass and porcelain
We'll be trashing motels
Tuttifrutti, it's all for free
Sell the gold, silverware
Burn the rest if I can't fit in
You're numero uno, ready for the win
Ready to fool everyone in the end
We'll be trashing motels
Tuttifrutti melt with me
