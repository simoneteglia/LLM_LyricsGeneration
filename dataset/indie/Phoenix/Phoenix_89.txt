[Intro]
Uh
Uh-huh

Okay, ayy, okay, ayy
Okay, ayy, I'm with BossTae, hey
With BossTae, hey, with BossTae, hey, fuck it
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
In the studio and I got that pack
I'm in the trap with a MAC, no cap
I'm fuckin' your bitch and I'm breakin' her back
I was ridin' around in the
Scat
(Skrrt)
Said she givin' me head, I'm like, "Bet" (Bet)
I can't wait 'til I jump off a jet (Off a jet)
I can't wait to cash out on a 'Vette (Huh?)
Why you speakin' on me? You in debt (Go)
Told that bitch, "Don't bite like Mike" (Let's go)
20 gang, Death gang, real right (Ayy)
Tell that lil' bitch to go take a hike (Let's get it)
She gon' ride on that dick like a bike (Yeah)
[Verse]
That's your bitch, I be givin' her pipe
I just poured a four, I'm high like a kite
I pour hella lean, codeine with promethazine
Think she feelin' me, I got racks up in my jeans
They can't fuck with me, ayy, and they scared of me (Uh-uh), ayy
I got court up on the 20th for a felony (Uh-huh), ayy
What they tellin' me? (Uh-huh) "You ain't in the street" (Uh-uh)
Big gun (Big gun), oh God (Ah), ayy
All these niggas be pussy, not built like I (Nah)
Niggas said it's smoke, and then he died (Died, damn)
[Chorus]
In the studio and I got that pack
I'm in the trap with a MAC, no cap
I'm fuckin' your bitch and I'm breakin' her back
I was ridin' around in the Scat (Skrrt)
Said she givin' me head, I'm like, "Bet" (Bet)
I can't wait 'til I jump off a jet (Off a jet)
I can't wait to cash out on a 'Vette (Huh?)
Why you speakin' on me? You in debt (Go)
Told that bitch, "Don't bite like Mike" (Let's go)
20 gang, Death gang, real right (Ayy)
Tell that lil' bitch to go take a hike (Let's get it)
She gon' ride on that dick like a bike (Yeah)
[Outro]
Uh, yeah
Got that pack
In the trap with a MAC, no cap
Bitch and I'm breakin' her back
I was ridin' around in the Scat
Wait 'til I jump off a jet
Speakin' on me, you in debt
Bitch, don't bite like Mike
20 gang, real right
Tell that lil' bitch to go take a hike
She gon' ride on that dick like a bike
Yeah
