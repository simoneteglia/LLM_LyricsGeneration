Just remember to forget me
I hate this honestly
Please take this the wrong way
Don’t need you to need me
I need you to disappear
Cause I carry ghosts
Of the things you’ve said
But you won't come home
Even if you’re dead
Night after night
Sleepless in Phoenix
Tell me a lie
Make me believe it
You got me right where you haunt me
You got me right where you haunt me
Your pieces are right here
But nothing really fits
I want you to want me
Then watch me disappear
Cause I carry ghosts of the things you said
I lay my bones to rest
Night after night
Sleepless in Phoenix
Tell me a lie
Make me believe it
You got me right where you haunt me
You got me right where you haunt me
Night after night
Need you to know this
Tears me apart
I hope that you’re hopeless too
I know we can kiss the past goodbye
I know we can kiss the past goodbye
I know we can kiss the past goodbye
Night after night
Sleepless in Phoenix
Tell me a lie
Make me believe it
You got me right where you haunt me
You got me right where you haunt me
Night after night
Need you to know this
Tears me apart
I hope that you’re hopeless too
You got me right where you haunt me
You got me right where you haunt me
And I know we can kiss the past goodbye
And I know we can kiss the past goodbye
And I know we can kiss the past goodbye
