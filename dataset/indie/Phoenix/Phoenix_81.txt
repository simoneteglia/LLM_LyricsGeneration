[Chorus]
Fences in a row
Fences in a row
Wired and protected
In a row
[Verse 1]
If only, your necessary silhouette
Unknown, join the dissi–, dissi–, dissidents
Got carried away, now hiding from their lies and discords
Once remembered, now forgotten
Come roll the dice for me
Roll the dice for me
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, better undone
If really on your own
Thinking this is fun
Feathers fallen from drapes
Fold her into pieces
Tied up and lace
[Chorus]
Fences in a row
Fences in a row
Wired and protected
In a row
[Verse 2]
Got carried away, thought I would've let you know
Oh no, did you miss a, miss a message?
I know you still
Would rather mess with me than get going
She's been building up a castle in L.A
Roll the dice for me
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, better undone
If really on your own
Thinking this is fun
Feathers fallen from drapes
Fold her into pieces
Tied up and lace
[Chorus]
Fences in a row
Fences in a row
Wired and protected
In a row
Fences in a row
Fences in a row
Wired and protected
In a row
