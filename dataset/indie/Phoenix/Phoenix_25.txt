[Verse 1]
Who's the boy you like the most
Is he teasing you with underage?
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset?
Static silhouette somehow
Single in his bed someday
Quiet 'til it falls, falls, falls
[Chorus]
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! What did I say? What can I say?
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving, you look the other way
[Verse 2]
That ain't easy to ignore
When your shutters are open all the way
When it's candlelight I see, I go insane
Distant silhouette somehow
We shared a cigarette somewhere
Addict 'til it falls, falls, falls
[Chorus]
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! What did I say? What can I say?
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving, you look the other way
[Bridge]
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
[Verse 3]
Always and forevermore
I call to say I'm on the way
Two-thousand years remain in a trash can
That burned a cigarette somewhere
Ashes 'til it fall, fall, falls
[Verse 4]
I stand outside under broken leaves
I know I can't do without
The future's trying to wait
I've never loved you, and if I loved you
I wouldn't say that I'm sorry, oh no
I stand outside under broken leaves
[Verse 5]
Always and forevermore
We're together dead and lonely
I thought I couldn't do this without you
Single in his bed somewhere
Ashes 'til it falls, falls, falls
[Bridge]
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
[Outro]
What did I say? What can I say?
