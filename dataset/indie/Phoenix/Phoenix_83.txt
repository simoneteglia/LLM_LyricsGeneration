[Intro: D Savage]
Bravestarr
3900 Sake
[Hook: D Savage]
Up next feelin' like a blessin'
Lesbians they kissin'
You fuck with Sake World, niggas bound to end up missin'
Chase the money that's the mission
Sittin' at home wishin'
That I could buy my moms a car and no, it is not rented
Two door gone spinnin', D Savage team winnin'
And this is the beginnin', im purp lake mixin'
Baby bottle fuckin' sippin', you pussy niggas simpin'
I'm kitchen chicken flippin', throw the neck and then I'm dippin'
[Verse 1: D Savage]
Count the guap, this bitch gotta wait
Fuckin' all these ho's, countin' comas, you can't relate
Brainstorm, what's the next play?
I had to cut off some my folks cause they was sniffin' too much ye
I love to floss like a dentist, a menace like I'm Dennis
Eleven niggas tried to get me but they couldn't finish
SUV hopped up in it, XL and it's tinted
Had to steal ain't have to flex, cause growing up I didn't get it
[Bridge:  D Savage]
Drop off these stacks, uh yeah
Drop off these caps, uh yeah
Drop off the track, uh yeah
Drop off the pack, uh yeah
Drop off these stacks, uh yeah
Drop off the pack, uh yeah
Drop off these stacks, uh yeah
Drop off these caps, uh yeah
[Hook: D Savage]
Up next feelin' like a blessin'
Lesbians they kissin'
You fuck with Sake World, niggas bound to end up missin'
Chase the money that's the mission
Sittin' at home wishin'
That I could buy my moms a car and no, it is not rented
Two door gone spinnin', D Savage team winnin'
And this is the beginnin', on purp lake mixin'
Baby bottle fuckin' sippin', you pussy niggas simpin'
I'm kitchen chicken flippin'
Throw the neck and then I'm dippin'
[Verse 2: D Savage]
I know you see me doin' shows
You wish you could rock with me
Count up the guap with me
Rock some Lonestar with me
But you not my gang, SUV switch lanes
Buy the cop a chain, that match my pinky ring
Run up, need everything
No this is not a game
Got locked up with Tae, cause we was hittin' stains
You do it for the hype, I do it cause it's life
I do it cause its life, strapped up, no fight
[Hook: D Savage]
Up next feelin' like a blessin'
Lesbians they kissin'
