[Verse 1]
This picture on your phone
Could do so much wrong
But we'll take it don't worry
And I know it already
Sleeping all alone
I been craving too long
Keep it quiet, go steady
Let's rip it all to confetti
A little bit of disrespect could be
Another way to break the ordinary
It's all a blur as far as I can see
No more begging already
Would you allow me to stay?
[Pre-Chorus]
On
We're meant to get it on
We're meant to get it on
We're meant to get it on
[Chorus]
Fior di latte, fior di latte
Throw your weight around behind me
Fior di latte, fior di latte
Don't think about it, trigger me happy
All other acts are for idiots
Come on come on come and provide it
Let's be quiet and wrap it up
Give me your fior di latte
[Verse 2]
My story's too long
Not that exciting, a mourning city
But there's no seasons in LA
Oh no! No you're not on your own
Just a minute alone will do
A little bit of disrespect could be
Another way to break the ordinary
Itâ€™s all too fancy, no it's not for me
No more bragging already
Till you got something to say
[Pre-Chorus]
On
We're meant to get it on
We're meant to get it on
We're meant to get it on
[Chorus]
Fior di latte, fior di latte
Throw your weight around behind me
Fior di latte, fior di latte
Don't think about it, trigger me happy
All other acts are for idiots
Come on come on come and provide it
Let's be quiet and wrap it up
Give me your fior di latte
On
We're meant to get it on
We're meant to get it on
We're meant to get it on
