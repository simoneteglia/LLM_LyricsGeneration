[Verse 1]
I wanted out of the Biblical bets
Oblique city credentials
It's everything that I've ever known
Coca-Cola's Rosetta Stone
Atlantis, if I really find it
Velocity, potentially
Not the logic of the momentum
It's way more than tragic
[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what to do
To show you better than lonely
[Chorus]
Am I gonna do this alone?
They're fifty-thousand versus one
Am I gonna do it all?
Am I gonna do this alone?
Or will you join me versus wrong?
Come on, come out and get me
[Verse 2]
I wanted odd, it was even and planned
Oblique city, potential
She's everything that I've ever won
Who wants the bronze, the silver, the gold?
Atlantis, if I really find it
Complexity, essentially
Not the logic of the momentum
It's way more than tragic
[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what to do
To show you better than lonely
[Chorus]
Am I gonna do this alone?
They're fifty-thousand versus one
Am I gonna do it all?
Am I gonna do this alone?
Or will you join me versus wrong?
Come on, come out and get me
[Outro]
Coca-Cola, beaten-up bottles, ah-ah-ah
Is there anything else? Is there anything wrong with me?
Buried Mayan numerals, ah-ah-ah
Is there anything else? Is there anything more for me?
Or anything else for me?
