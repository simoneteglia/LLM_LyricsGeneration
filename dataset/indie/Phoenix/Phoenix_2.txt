[Intro]
Put on your war paint
[Verse 1]
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to dies
Silver clouds with grey linings
[Pre-Chorus]
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time, we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
[Chorus]
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
[Verse 2]
Bring home the boys in scraps,
scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass
[Pre-Chorus]
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time, we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
[Chorus]
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
[Break]
Put on your war paint
[Bridge]
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves,
surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves,
surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves
,
surrender love
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
The war is won before it's begun
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
Release the doves,
surrender love
(Wave the white flag, wave the white flag, yeah)
[Chorus]
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
[Outro]
Put on your war paint
