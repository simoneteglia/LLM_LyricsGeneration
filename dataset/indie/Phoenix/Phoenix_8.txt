[Verse 1]
City and desert coexist
Depending on the things you're wearing
Wildlife binoculars
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me
[Verse 2]
They teach you suffer to resist
Too much intention, Presbyterian
Mint julep testosterone
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want me
[Chorus]
Cool
I'm just trying to be cool
It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on
[Post-Chorus]
Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Is innocent too immature where youâ€™re from?
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all
[Verse 3]
Two dozen pink and white ranunculus
Why? What are the problems to solve?
To part-time holy bachelors
Tell them that you want me
Tell them that you want me
[Chorus]
Cool
I'm just trying to be cool
It's all because of you
Some fanatic attitude we're both on
[Post-Chorus]
Open for business says it all, you can't go wrong
Compliments sound too cynical where you're from
Tell me that you want me
Tell me what they want is
[Bridge]
Gruesome
I don't care where you're from
Nothing's that personal
There is no physical evidence of cannibal boyfriends
[Outro]
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you want it all
Why don't you tell me that you want me?
Tell me that you want it all
