I never thought I'd get you alarmed
Pretend and let pretend it’s a draw, it's a draw
Withdrawn, I never meant to leave you alone
Many relentless promises
And if I realize that I want you to know
I'm turning into partying alone
Kisses
I love you anyway
I never thought you'd get me in line
Forget and forgotten young protégé
So let me control, regret that I broke our thing
Now somebody took my apology
I love you anyway
Would you love her lovelife?
Would you love her lovelife?
Would you love her lovelife?
I love you anyway
