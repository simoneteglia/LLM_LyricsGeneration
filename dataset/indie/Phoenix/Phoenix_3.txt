[Verse]
I know, rockin' fancy clothes (Yeah)
Fucked your ex bitch, I got some shit you wanna know
Catch me cruisin' through the 9, posted at the corner store
I just got some drop, go cop me a Faygo
Got groupie hoes on my dick and they do what I say so
Went to the bank then dipped to the crib so I could change clothes
She see my ice then she know that I'm a boss (What?)
She wanna fuck me, cuff me, but I ain't with that shit
Cuban Jesus piece around my neck, it look like dirty piss
Bitch, I'm at the trap house makin' plays, I drop a stack to make it flip
The same niggas that's hatin' on me girlfriend ride all on my dick
You say you hate me but you stalk my page, you fucking hypocrite
[Chorus]
I know (I know)
I know (I know)
I know (I know)
I know (I know)
All these bitches they be blowin' up my phone, ayy
I know, ayy (I know)
I know, yeah, ayy
Double cup the styrofoam, ayy (Yeah)
I know, ayy (Yeah)
I know, ayy (I know)
Do your dance on that bitch, I know, ayy (I know)
I know, ayy (I know)
I know, I know, I know (Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it)
