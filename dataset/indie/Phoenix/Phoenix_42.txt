[Verse 1]
Waking in the rubble
Walking over glass
Neighbors say we're trouble
Well, that time has passed
Peering from the mirror
No, that isn't me
A stranger getting nearer
Who can this person be?
[Pre-Chorus]
You wouldn't know me at all today
From the fading light, I fly
[Chorus]
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But you're my flame
[Verse 2]
Go about your business
Act as if you're free
No one could have witnessed
What you did to me
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you wouldn't know me today
And you have got to see to believe
From the fading light, I fly
[Chorus]
Rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I'm reborn
[Bridge]
I rise up to the sky
You threw me down but
I'm gonna fly
[Chorus]
And rise like a phoenix
Out of the ashes
Seeking rather than vengeance, retribution
You were warned
Once I'm transformed, once I'm reborn
You know I will rise like a phoenix
But youâ€™re my flame
