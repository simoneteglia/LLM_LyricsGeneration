[Verse 1]
Where would you go?
Not long ago, Iâ€™ve been thinking out loud
Why so suddenly?
D-d-don't you know?
Don't do it, what you do, oh, what you do to me
Forever is a long, long time
When you've lost your way
Trying to follow your ideal
Oh, sorry but your so-called life
It is such a waste
[Pre-Chorus]
Wear your real eyes
No, you don't realize
What you say yes to
But you say yes, too
[Chorus]
Where would you go, where would you go
With a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?
Where would you go, where would you go
Tied up to a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?
[Verse 2]
So lonely, so pretty, such a lack of diplomacy
You can't get out
D-don't you know? Oh, don't do it
What you do well, you should do to me
Far out, so far out, such a fallout
Not only that you're lonely
Don't matter if you're not so well (Not so well)
No, you're not so well
[Chorus]
Where would you go, where would you go
With a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?
Where would you go, where would you go
Tied up to a lasso?
Could you run into, could you run into
Could you go and run into me?
[Post-Chorus]
Wear your real eyes
No, you don't realize
What you say yes to
But you say yes, too
[Outro]
Tomorrow (Forever) is a long, long time
When you've lost your way
Tomorrow (Forever) is a long, long time
When you've lost your way
