[Intro]
Y-Y-Yung Lan on the track
[Chorus]
I got pumps on top of pumps
In the cut, I'm toolied up
Like what you want? Ayy (What you want?)
What you want? (What you want?)
I been runnin' to that green
I been servin' all the fiends
Like what you want? Ayy, uh (What you want?)
What you want? (What you want?)
[Post-Chorus]
Pullin' off in a fast car
All black on the Jaguar
I know niggas wanna be me
I'm your neighbourhood trap star
I got pumps on top of pumps
I got sticks, I'm toolied up
Like what you want? Ayy
What you want? Ayy
[Verse]
These niggas look like a lick, uh
Twitter beefin' like a bitch, uh
And I just poured up a brick, uh
I ain't tryna feel shit, uh
I ain't tryna hear shit, uh
Baby, don't fuck me, just suck, uh
Baby, these niggas ain't tough, no
Servin' them hollows for lunch, uh
I keep that chopper on me, uh
Pickin', I'm liftin' them up, uh
I think I need a new safe, huh
Baby, I'm fillin' it up, uh (Let's go)
Some of my niggas OT (Lesgetit)
White John be keepin' it tucked, uh (Lesgetit)
Nigga, these bullets is free (Free)
But fuck it, we tyin' him up
[Bridge]
I keep my 40
And your hoes adore me
I'm like, baby, come on
Baby, come on
You got a feelin'
'Cause I'm in the building
Like, baby, come on
Baby, come on
[Chorus]
I got pumps on top of pumps
In the cut, I'm toolied up
Like what you want? Ayy (What you want?)
What you want? (What you want?)
I been runnin' to that green
I been servin' all the fiends
Like what you want? Ayy, uh (What you want?)
What you want? (What you want?)
[Post-Chorus]
Pullin' off in a fast car
All black on the Jaguar
I know niggas wanna be me
I'm your neighbourhood trap star
I got pumps on top of pumps
I got sticks, I'm toolied up
Like what you want? Ayy
What you want? Ayy
