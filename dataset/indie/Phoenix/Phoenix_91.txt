[Verse 1]
I ain't changing my ways
Lo siento
I don't give a **** what they say
Lo siento
Even when I'm away
You know I come back and stay stay
Lo siento
[Pre-Chorus]
They know I'm an Aventura
De nada
They say that nobody truer
De nada
No nobody can blame us
De nada
They mad they ain't famous
Shove it up your anus
[Chorus]
Everybody stare, everybody stare
Extraordinaire, extraordinaire
How we go nowhere, how we go nowhere
But we're just going slow
Didn't you know that
You're a little bit too late
Better come my way
Su casa mi casa
I say
Mi casa su casa
No way
[Verse 2]
I don't fuck with your city
Hate the vibe
Lo siento
I only make music with my guys
Don't send beats
Don't even try
'Cause of Spanish I had to do the 10th grade twice
[Pre-Chorus]
They know I'm an Aventura
De nada
They say that nobody truer
De nada
No nobody can blame us
De nada
They mad they ain't famous
[Chorus]
Everybody stare, everybody stare
Extraordinaire, extraordinaire
How we go nowhere, how we go nowhere
But we're just going slow
Didn't you know that
You're a little bit too late
Better come my way
Su casa mi casa
I say
Mi casa su casa
No way
[Chorus]
Everybody stare, everybody stare
Extraordinaire, extraordinaire
How we go nowhere, how we go nowhere
You're a little bit too late
Better come my way
Su casa mi casa
I say
Mi casa su casa
No way
You're a little bit too late
Better come my way
Su casa mi casa
I say
Mi casa su casa
No way
