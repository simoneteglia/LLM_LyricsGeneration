[Verse 1]
Countdown, unless you're juvenile, let's go
God bless your miss somewhere
We're sick for the big sun
It doesn't matter what you did
And if you did it like you been told
[Pre-Chorus]
True and everlasting, that's what you want
True, true and everlasting, that's what you want
Don't say no, your breakfast eaten alone
Resist or let go, you're borderline withdrawn
Down, unlit from the bottom, there is a misfit
Better than it looks, better than it looks
Better than it looks, better than it looks
[Chorus]
We're sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick
We're sick for the big sun
We rumble and trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip
I realize that too
[Verse 2]
Hear the lonesome bell, is this knowledge?
Ask forgiveness you know somewhere
You're fixed to an atom
It doesn't matter what you did
And if you did it right, let's go
[Pre-Chorus]
Cruel and everlasting, that's what you want
Cruel, cruel and everlasting, that's what you want
Don't say no, your breakfast eaten alone
Do you remember when 21 years was old?
Down, unlit, does it matter that you care the less?
Better than it looks, better than it looks
Better than it looks, better than it looks
[Chorus]
We're sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick
We're sick for the big sun
We rumble and trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip
I realize that too
[Outro]
True, true and everlasting, it didn't last that long
We're the lonesome, we're the lonesome yell
True and everlasting, it didn't last that long
True, true and everlasting, it didn't last that long
We're the lonesome, we're the lonesome yell
True and everlasting, it didn't last that long
We're the lonesome, we're the lonesome
