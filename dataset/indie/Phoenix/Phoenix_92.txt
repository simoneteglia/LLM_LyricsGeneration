[Verse 1]
Where to go? I had no idea
€26.10 was the price to pay
A messed up kid with no ideals at all
I thought those €26.10, I shouldn't give 'em away
I remember this young guy died and I took his part
He got far too many stitches on his pretty face
Long time to see, but I always thought us two would be serious
I was looking around town, thinking the same as you
[Chorus]
I'm far gone, but your long distance call
And your capital letters keep me asking for more
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that, no
I'm far gone, but your long distance call
And your capital letters keep me asking for more
[Verse 2]
Where to go? I had no idea about it
Most of the people do, they're only doing just fine
I don't want to stay in place no more, see
Ain't doing well, well, well, I'm only doing just fine
Long time, no see, long time, no say
Got little to tell, I don't say much, but I might
Something always told me us two would be serious
I am looking around town, thinking the same as you
[Chorus]
I'm far gone, but your long distance call
And your capital letters keep me asking for more
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that, no
Far gone, but your long distance call
And your capital letters keep me asking for more
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that
It's never been like that, it's never been like that, no
Far gone, but your long distance call
And your capital letters keep me asking for more
[Outro]
Long time, no see
Long time, no say
