[Intro]
Listen up, you sloppy jalopy son of a bitch, sitting on your fucking couch, with your fucking phone in your hand, doing your armchair detective work: think you know what the fuck is going on?
When was the last time you kept a two month social media silence?
You think I wasn't going to say shit?
[Verse 1]
I'm a let y'all talk shit talk shit
If I had a fuck to give, I would give it
If ya feel froggy, ain't gotta Leap
All you gotta do is ribbit (is ribbit)
I'll be puttin' on a zero fucks given exhibit
I got nothing to lose and I'm in it
And if I'm in it
Then I'm in it to win it
Sky's the limit? Sorry officer
Got to admit it
Yeah I'm over the limit
Left Cloud 9 with a one way ticket
Rolled up with it, spark that bitch
Cloud 99 when it left my lips
I pissed excellence, bitch I just shitted
Eyes full of hate on the Crazy 8's
Umm, Wanna see how I pivot?
Ball in my court - bounce back wearing number 24
Wipe a Shit footprint right off My Image
Don't just look 'cause you can listen
Double edged sword: one side love, one side hate
Either way I glisten
I ain't dull
What's he gonna say?
What's he gonna do?
Got 'em on their toes like a midget at a urinal
Cuppa red roses on my gimmick
Cuppa tears at the funeral
They Cried Tears of joy at my funeral
They Cried Tears of joy at my funeral
[Chorus]
And Still I rise
From the ashes like a phoenix
Middle finger to the sky grippin' my...
Consensual penis
Lyin' ass hoe out in Phoenix
When I say this shit I mean it
Fuck you marks that hated
This for all my fans that waited
Entertainment's hottest free agent
Bitch I'm reincarnated
[Verse 2]
Gucci Witch, you dirty bitch!
If Arrogance is bliss, So is innocence
This Apocalypse?
Guilty till you're proven innocent?
Ass backwards bullshit is this?
Ass backwards bullshit is this?
I got a lot less to prove than you
Only thing I put in that pudding was proof
Yeah the proof is in the puddin' bitch
Puddin' ain't got no Rufilin
Naw I ain't Bill Cosby Biiiiiihhhh
Naw I ain't Bill Cosby Bitch
Proof was only ingredient I used to make this shit
They can feel when you're real
When you're genuine, you're bound to win!
Six Years as a role model
Time to slightly remodel
Going full throttle
I ain't thinking 'bout tomorrow
I ain't got a buck to borrow
Lawyered up and wipe me down
See you at the civil trial
Bitch them wages getting garnished
Uhh bitch them wages getting garnished
For my image that you tarnished
I ain't askin' for an ounce of sorrow
See, this the best day of my life;
I can't wait for tomorrow
I can't wait for tomorrow
[Verse 3]
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Fame can be forsaken
Tweet an allegation
Falsify a statement
Fake news and defamation (defamation)
Due to media speculation
Based on misinformation; it's the basis of damnation
For our whole fuckin' nation
Break a story (break a story)  and then you jump to conclusions
Break an ankle when you land and never cast a resolution
(Nah, Never, nah nah, whatever)
[Verse 4]
TMZ owes me some restitution
In the midst of disillusion
Choosing public prosecution over constitution
Ain't the right solution
Gender persecution hurts the #MeToo movement
And our women's revolution
The fuck you doin'?!
[Verse 5]
All of you that's ever been abused
You scream me too
I stand by you (I stand by you)
But for the wrongfully accused
Justice long overdue
So here's a big fuck you
Fuck you
Yeah from me to you
And to anyone that's doubted me
My dear mama is still fuckin' proud of me
[Bridge]
You got your 15 minutes girl
I ain't mad at ya
Nothin' but love for ya
I got me against the world and...
[Chorus]
Still I rise
From the ashes like a phoenix
Middle finger to the sky grippin' my...
Consensual penis
Lyin' ass hoe out in Phoenix
When I say this shit I mean it
Fuck you marks that hated
This for all my fans that waited
Entertainment's hottest free agent
Bitch I'm reincarnated
