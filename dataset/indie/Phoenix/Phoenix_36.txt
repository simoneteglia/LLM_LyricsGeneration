[Verse 1]
Tired out, not a miracle in days, oh yeah
Deciders for the lonely, whispering tears
You try out for nothing then you drop dead
Not a miracle in years, leisure for the lonely
Whispering unnecess–ess–essary unless–ess–ess you're in
[Chorus]
Die and succeed
I say it out loud, but you just don't care
Farewell, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well
'Til you know me well
Farewell, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well
'Til you know me well
Girlfriend
[Verse 2]
We are far from home, I am with you now
I am longing you, I am longing us two
Who bought a miracle sells these fortune tears
December's death or glory, how you want it?
No, not a miracle in years, deciders for the lonely
Wishing death, death, death wishes death, death, death, unless
[Chorus]
Die and succeed
I say it out loud but you just don't care
Farewell, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well
'Til you know me well
Farewell, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well
'Til you know me well
Girlfriend
Die and succeed
I say it out loud but she just don't care
Farewell, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well
–Well, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well
–Well, –well, –well, –well, –well, –well
Girlfriend
