[Verse 1]
I remember when I was told a story of
Crushed velvet, candle wax, dried up flowers
The figure on the bed, all dressed up in rose, calling
Beckoning to sleep, offering a dream
[Verse 2]
Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
Time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me
[Chorus]
(Oh!)
I fell into yesterday (Oh!)
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay (Oh!)
I fell into fantasy
[Verse 2]
Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
Time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me
[Chorus]
(Oh!)
I fell into yesterday (Oh!)
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay (Oh!)
I fell into fantasy
[Interlude]
The girl on the wall always waited for me (Oh!)
And she was always smiling
The teenage death boys, the teenage death girls
And everyone was dancing
Nothing could touch us then, no one could change us then
Everyone was dancing
Nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then
Everyone was dancing
[Pre-Chorus]
No one could see me
[Chorus]
(Oh!)
I fell into yesterday (Oh!)
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay (Oh!)
I fell into fantasy
[Outro]
Our dreams seemed not far away
Our dreams seemed not far away
Our dreams seemed not far away
I fell into fantasy
