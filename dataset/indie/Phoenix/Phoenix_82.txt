[Intro: Charlie Wilson]
It's a check, oh-wee
Oh
[Chorus: Guapdad 4000 &
Charlie Wilson
]
Ayy, she don’t wanna give me my Gucci pajamas back
Just bend over, I damage that
She distract me from the hints (Yeah)
That she stealin' all my shit (
Oh-wee
), yeah
I got options, at least I thought (Options)
I can't find all the shit that I bought
Did I actually buy the shit? Nah (Ayy)
[Verse 1: Guapdad 4000]
She got me runnin’ through a checklist, ooh
Girl be fuckin' with the bestest, yeah
She always touchin' all my extra shit
But my extra shit's never basic, ayy
She act like she spent money on this
You don't gotta steal, let's fuck and chill
She's in my closet, take all my shit
Then plead the Fifth, ain't that a bitch? Yeah
Yeah, go ’head, mama
Suck me up ’til I forget about them red problems
I'd rather pay the time with you than have fed problems
I let you spend one night, and now
[Chorus: Guapdad 4000 &
Charlie Wilson
]
She don’t wanna give me my Gucci pajamas back
Just bend over, I damage that
She distract me from the hints (Yeah)
That she stealin' all my shit (
Oh-wee
), yeah
I got options, at least I thought (Options)
I can't find all the shit that I bought
Did I actually buy the shit? Nah
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Look
She tried to steal all my clothes on some broke shit
Then tried to throw away my Gucci on some woke shit
Then tried to link up with my exes on some cult shit
That shit is weird, left-handed chandelier
Hit Atlanta, disappear
Witness protection, I see her damn reflection in the mirror
Get that Windex on them spirits, I just need a can of beer
Was spotted like panda bear
Now all my pajama-wear is whiter than Santa beard
Whiter than Bon Iver, whiter than Sonny, Cher
Why did she steal my shit? Why did I even share?
How did she steal my drip? Give me back all my shit
Why did I even share? Give me back all my clothes
Kleptomaniac bitch, Ocean's Eleven shit
Give me back all my shit, give me back all my clothes
Stealin’ all of my 'fits, poppin' up at events
No way, you not my bitch, so bitch, leave me alone
[Chorus: Guapdad 4000 &
Charlie Wilson
]
She don't wanna give me my Gucci pajamas back
Just bend over, I damage that
She distract me from the hints (Yeah)
That she stealin' all my shit, yeah
I got options, at least I thought (Options)
I can't find all the shit that I bought
Did I actually buy the shit? Nah
[Bridge: Chance the Rapper &
Charlie Wilson
]
Gucci pajamas (
Gucci
)
Gucci pajamas (
Oh-wee
)
I don't need Gucci pajamas (
Gucci
)
I need a restraining order (
Oh-wee
)
[Chorus: Guapdad 4000 &
Charlie Wilson
]
She don't wanna give me my Gucci pajamas back
Just bend over, I damage that
She distract me from the hints (Yeah)
That she stealin' all my shit, yeah
I got options, at least I thought (Options)
I can't find all the shit that I bought
Did I actually buy the shit? Nah
[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Oh, she won't, she won't, she won't, she won't give 'em back
She won't give 'em back, no, no
Oh, she won't, she won't, she won't, she won't give 'em back
She won't give 'em back, no, no, oh
