[Intro]
Uh, racks on me, yeah, you already know
Looking for double C and G when I'm in the store, yeah
Racks on me, yeah, you already know
Looking for double C and G when I'm in the store
CakeBoy Bally
[Chorus]
Uh, I want the money for sure
Just give me them racks and I'll do a show (Ayy)
I got a K with a scope
I got them racks on me, yeah, you already know
Looking for double C and G when I'm in the store (Uh, uh, ayy)
I'm bagging it up just to sell it
I bought a new chain but I need a Patek
Applying the pressure, I'm letting you have it
I'm calling my killers if it's really static
I'm fly to death, put me in a casket
I'm popping this shit 'cause I never had it
I pick up a brick and then I hit traffic
[Verse 1]
I got a chopper on me, yeah, I'm driving slow
I whip that mace and it's magic (Playboy)
We put dog food in the attic, uh (Playboy)
I hop in the streets and go savage, uh
Let's talk 'bout my bitch, she the baddest, uh
She wanna fuck me all night off the Addys, uh
I'ma face a Backwood, I can't pass it (Yeah)
I'ma just sit on my Xans, I'ma just fade away
I'ma stack all my bread, save it for a rainy day
Fuck what a hater say, I'ma still get paid
I'ma take care of the gang, laughing to the bank, uh (Ayy)
[Chorus]
Uh, I want the money for sure
Just give me them racks and I'll do a show (Ayy)
I got a K with a scope
I got them racks on me, yeah, you already know
Looking for double C and G when I'm in the store
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm bagging it up just to sell it
I bought a new chain but I need a Patek
Applying the pressure, I'm letting you have it
I'm calling my killers if it's really static
I'm fly to death, put me in a casket
I'm popping this shit 'cause I never had it
I pick up a brick and then I hit traffic (Yeah, uh, ayy, ayy)
[Verse 2]
I promise I'm real as they come
I'm fucking your bitch, I'm making her cum
I'm smoking on gas, take over my lungs
I pull up with sticks, I pull up with drums
You think this a lick but I ain't the one
He wanna fight but I got a gun
Niggas is dick suckin' ass bums (Ayy)
I'm getting money, I know you can see it
I keep a bad bitch and you know she conceited
If I'm in the trap, get the pot, I'ma beat it
If it don't make no sense when you talking, I'm leaving (Uh)
[Chorus]
Uh, I want the money for sure
Just give me them racks and I'll do a show (Uh)
I got a K with a scope
I got them racks on me, yeah, you already know
Looking for double C and G when I'm in the store
(Uh)
[Outro]
Racks on me, yeah, you already know
Looking for double C and G when I'm in the store (Yeah)
Racks on me, yeah, you already know
Looking for double C and G when I'm in the store (I get them racks on me, uh, ayy)
I'm bagging it up just to sell it (Ayy, racks on me)
Applying the pressure, I'm letting you have it (Applying pressure)
I'm fly to death, put me in a casket (Racks on me)
I pick up a brick and then I hit traffic
