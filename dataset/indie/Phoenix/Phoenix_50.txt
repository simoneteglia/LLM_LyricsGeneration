[Hook]
I know
Niggas love to talk, love to hate, like a bitch
But nigga, that's okay cause Sake World is gettin' rich
Yo' gang full of faggots, I can't rock with yo' clique
It's a dog eat dog world, nigga I'm a fuckin' pit
Yellow diamonds, dirty piss, styrofoam, dirty mix
Don't hit me up if you pussy niggas ain't on no shit
I see you flexing gear that I like, hit a lick
All the thotties at my show, come back stage if you thick
[Verse 1]
A demon sittin' on my shoulder
Hoes wanna fuck cause a nigga glowed up
The OG gas be my odor
29, ice cold, neck polar
God damn I love stuntin', hoes fuckin' for nothin'
I started with nothing
SD get to bustin'
Play your part, and just do what hoes do
Fuck up out my face if I don't fuckin' know you
Mama raised a beast
All my niggas eat, all my niggas feast
Dump a body in the street
To all my haters, I'll leave a nigga deceased
Don't you fuck with me, hey, don't you fuck with me
All my money, count it up
Walk up to the spot, show me love
Desert Eagle with the 40, keep it tucked
If you got a blunt, then light it up, light it up
