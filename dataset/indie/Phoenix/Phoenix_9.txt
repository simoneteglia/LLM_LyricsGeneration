[Intro]
Aight, let's do it
Think you're alright
[Verse]
I don't think I really got it
I don't think that I can get over all of my problems
I've been thinking, who the fuck am I to disagree?
I heard I'm pretty dope so I guess I gotta oblige
Inside, I been plotting on a way that we can elevate
A massacre to chop up your skin, I never hesitate
I put a lot of time into the craft, I make it resonate
I regulate with repetition; I could be the greatest
But half of me illogical, the other half elated
Practice on the pages that I got in my attentive mind
(
Think you're alright
)
I minimize the ignorance
So when I'm in it I make it relatable
Evade the negativity at all costs
Tryna find my way, I'm feelin' so lost
Find me in the zone, I gotta focus
But that can be an issue, I'm addicted to the work
It's all I ever wanna do, pursue the purpose that I'm pleading for
And need it more than pity, man
Them minuscule opinions picking apart the immaculate
(
Think you're alright
)
Happily apathetic and actually authentic
This sentence is sentimental like the words are just a piece of my soul, lawd!
I transcend into the artist that I wanna be
(
High stakes
)
I demonstrate my dominance; a derelict with dialect
My etiquette is excellence, I dedicate my all to this
I solemnly swear that I serenade with selections
(
Transform, you stand alone
)
And different cadences to kill it
Really givin' that in this and
Anyone that wants the truth that we present to be identified
I live a meager life
I'm motivated by progression 'cause a year ago nobody paid attention to the kid
And I'm persistent with the effort, document my declaration
(
High stakes
)
Dedicated to the death of me, definitely concerned that I prefer to be a purist
I'm purging all of the verses
Only way to get it off of my chest, oh lawd!
(
Transform and stand alone
)
If it's a problem, I solve it privately; polish 'em off
I punish with powerful poems, compose a doper​ creation
Case in point, I'm steadily provin' this ain't a lucid dream
I used to be infatuated, now it's just reality, I'm managing my temperament, my time to capitalize isn't infinite, the wisdom I'm attaining from trial and effort is priceless
I pride myself on putting the music before my sanity
Sing you a lullaby with alliteration and empathy
The lack of recognition is starting to fuel my energy
You know you made it when you receivin' hate from an enemy
(
You're not alright
)
Irrelevance was never an option, here's the synopsis
Said I'm knockin' out whoever you considerin' the king
I'll kick him off the throne, I want it, I'ma take it as my property
And properly prepared to go to war with any challenger
I battle in Colosseums, people cheer for me to finish it
Reminiscing of the legends that left remarkable legacies
I said that I'm ahead of my time, I am
You can never understand the headspace I'm in, I
Live and I'm writing about it
Giving a lyrical ballad
Workin' on findin' a balance
Dealin' with every challenge, but
It's a struggle, meticulously​ adjustin' my train of thought to be positive; transform to a phoenix
[Bridge]
And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it, lawd!
And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it, lawd!
And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it, lawd!
And we just tryna give you something you remember
We the illest, nigga, don't ever forget it!
[Outro]
Ay, knowledge; ORBT
High stakes
Transform, you stand alone
High stakes
Transform, you stand alone
