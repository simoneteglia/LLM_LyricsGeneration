[Verse 1]
Pronto? Si...
Come va a Hollywood?
Oh you're staying a little longer?
Well I thought you'd be done by September...
[Bridge]
Non posso vivere
Troppo bisogno di te
Wish you decided to stay
We're too far, we're too far away
[Chorus]
Vivere
Guarda, guarda intorno a te
Yeah I'm just calling to say
No,
how can I sleep when you're wide awake?
Frutti di mare
Right beside me
Watch the ocean with you
Innamorato
Agitato
Watch her movie debut
[Verse 2]
I painted the house
I bought sheets that you liked on that trip when we went to Rome
And I got a motorboat for the summer
In case you're done early or if you plan to visit
But wait... D'you plan to visit?
[Bridge]
Non posso vivere
Troppo bisogno di te
Wish you decided to stay
We're too far, we're too far away
[Chorus]
Vivere
Guarda, guarda intorno a te
Yeah I'm just calling to say
No, how can I sleep when you're wide awake?
Frutti di mare
Right beside me
Watch the ocean with you
Innamorato
Agitato
Watch her movie debut
[Verse 3]
I wish you'd call from set
I wish I didn't get upset
Who's that guy you hang out with?
Is he the lead or just an extra?
Instead of calling please ritorna a me
How can I sleep when you're wide awake?
[Bridge]
Non posso vivere
Troppo bisogno di te
Wish you decided to stay
We're too far, we're too far away
[Chorus]
Vivere
Guarda, guarda intorno a te
Yeah I'm just calling to say
How can I sleep when you're wide awake?
[Outro]
Telefono
Ringing for me
Can I tell you?
I dream in stereo
And in a studio
Far far away
I might lose you
To some executive
Telefono
Ringing for me
Can I tell you?
I dream in stereo
And in a studio
Far far away
I'm here solo
In Passoscuro
