But you thought they put their best man on it
Give him a chance, something to do
Yeah you got to ask a hella lot of questions
The chance of a lifetime
If you got to trust the guy he's no impersonator
What's the matter with him mowing your lawn?
Yeah you got to make it up cause you're the perpetrator
Do you want to find out?
So sudden, d'you hear the riot, hear them scream outside?
I can't tell you what it's going to be, I'd lie
Out of credit, did I hear you breathe out loud
You know he's in it to see the summit
You know he's in it to see the summit
To see the summit, to see the summit
Role role role model
On the podium
Real loud
Same old recital
A chameleon
Disguised
Never out of luck
Never out of love
Always out of cash
So help him if you will
Climbing up the hill
Signing autographs
Role role role model
On the podium
Real loud
Don't you feel like a witness in distress from time to time to time to time?
Is that just the way the roses fade? Do you want to find out?
Don't you feel like a witness in distress from time to time to time to time?
Is that just the way the roses fade? Do you want to find out?
So sudden, d'you hear the quiet summer breeze outside?
I can't tell you what it's going to be, I'd lie
Out of credit, I hear you suffer, breathe out loud
You know you're in it to see the summit
You know you're in it to see the summit
To see the summit, to see summit
Role role role model
On the podium
Real loud
Same old recital
A chameleon
Disguised
Never out of luck
Never out of love
Always out of cash
So help him if you will
Climbing up the hill
Signing autographs
Role role role model
On the podium
Real loud
Cheer on
Real loud
Cheer on
The chance of a lifetime
Why cheer on?
Real loud
Cheer on
The chance of a lifetime
(Don't you feel like a witness in distress)
Cheer on
(From time to time to time to time?)
Real loud
(Is that just the way the roses fade?)
Cheer on
(Do you want to find out?)
(Don't you feel like a witness in distress)
Cheer on
