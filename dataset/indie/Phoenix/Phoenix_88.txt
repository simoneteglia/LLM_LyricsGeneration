[Verse 1]
Baby when I saw you turning in
At the end of the street
I knew a time was gone
And it took me like ages
Just to understand
That I was afraid to be a simple guy
I tried my best to smile
But deep inside my heart
I felt it would shout like a crowd dancing
I guess I couldn't live without the things
That made my life what it is
[Chorus]
Can't you hear it calling, oh yeah
Everybody's dancing, oh yeah
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young
[Verse 2]
I can't lie on my bed
Without thinking I was wrong
But when this feeling calls
This world becomes another
Nighttime won't hold me in your arms again
I got a very good friend who says
He can't believe the love I give
Is not enough to end your fears
I guess I couldn't live without the things
That made my life what it is
[Chorus]
Can't you hear it calling, oh yeah
Everybody's shaking, oh yeah
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young
[Verse 3]
Oh rainfalls and hard times coming
They won't leave me tonight
I wish I knew what I was doing
Just do let this spirit survive
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody's dancing oh yeah
I guess I couldn't live without the things
That made my life what it is
[Chorus]
Can't you hear it calling, oh yeah
Everybody's dancing, oh yeah
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young
[Chorus]
Can't you hear it calling, oh yeah
Everybody's shaking, oh yeah
Tonight everything is over
I feel too young
[Outro]
Can't you hear it calling
