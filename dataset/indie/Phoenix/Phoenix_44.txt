[Verse: Robin Pecknold]
Out in the loading bay light
Watching the fog recede
Divided the flame you slowly gave to me
Sign of relief in my mind
But I only caught you the one time
Later I'd watch you and wonder what it was like
[Pre-Chorus: Robin Pecknold]
How do you bear the full weight?
How does the long way feel?
Kneading your hand too tight against the wheel?
How do you stay in that tower?
How do you reckon your own power?
How does the wheel not turn hour on hour on hour?
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Anaïs Mitchell]
I was trying to find my way
I was thinking my mind was made
But you were making my heart change shape
It's all that I could take
I was trying to find my way
I was thinking my mind was made
But you were making my heart change shape
It's all that I could take
[Pre-Chorus: Robin Pecknold]
How do you bear the full weight?
How does the long way feel?
Kneading your hand too tight against the wheel?
How do you stay in that tower?
How do you reckon your own power?
How does the wheel not turn hour on hour on hour?
[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Anaïs Mitchell]
I was trying to find my way
I was thinking my mind was made
But you were making my heart change shape
It's all that I could take
I was trying to find my way
I was thinking my mind was made
But you were making my heart change shape
It's all that I could take, now
I was trying to find my way
I was thinking my mind was made
But you were making my heart change shape
It's all that I could take, now
I was trying to find my way
I was thinking my mind was made
But you were making my heart change shape
It's all that I could take, now
[Outro: Robin Pecknold,
Justin Vernon
]
How do you stay in that tower?
How does the long way feel?
How does the wheel not turn hour on hour on hour?
(Trying to find my way)
(I was thinking my mind was made)
(All that I, all that I could)
