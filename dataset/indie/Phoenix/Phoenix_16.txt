[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
(
Plugg!
)
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(D fucking Phoenix)
[Chorus]
You forgot all about me
Switched up for the clout, tell these niggas get from 'round me
I know I'm the shit, so these niggas cannot stand me
I'm in love with my gang, bitch, 'cause that's my only family
Try to touch my gang, and that chopper sing a melody
Opera
[Verse 1]
Runnin' from them coppers
Hi Tec, bussin', got it from the doctors
Phony, fugazi, these niggas imposters
I'm out eatin' pasta, I like my shrimp with lobster
Don't put your trust in no ho, thought you knew that
Me and my niggas pull up, broad day, knock your scalp back
At the bank, I got hella racks, bitch, count that
Yeen drillin' shit, yeen 'bout that
"Savage, baby, boy, you drive me brazy"
Gettin' rich and smokin' dope, you been gettin' lazy
Best believe, I'll never let a fuck nigga play me
Bitch, pay me, nigga, pay me
[Chorus]
You forgot all about me
Switched up for the clout, tell these niggas get from 'round me
I know I'm the shit, so these niggas cannot stand me
I'm in love with my gang, bitch, 'cause that's my only family
Try to touch my gang, and that chopper sing a melody
Opera
[Verse 2]
There go helicopters
Catch a body, Gucci'd down, feelin' like the Wopster
Chase the money, I get it, I'm sendin' shots up out the chopper
All my niggas be with it, tango down on this mission
We gon' scratch 'em off the earth to show 'em how we be livin'
I'm cookin' up in the kitchen, baby doin' them dishes
I be shooting 223s, but I be rockin' them Pippens
I'm booted up at a show, pockets full of them rolls
Hit a twenty band jugg, y'all ain't gettin' no dough
Bag it up, sack it up, then we hittin' the road
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me, yeah, came with the AK
Niggas keep fuckin' with me, shoot you in broad day
[Chorus]
You forgot all about me
Switched up for the clout, tell these niggas get from 'round me
I know I'm the shit, so these niggas cannot stand me
I'm in love with my gang, bitch, 'cause that's my only family
Try to touch my gang, and that chopper sing a melody
