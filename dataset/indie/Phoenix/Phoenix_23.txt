[Verse 1]
By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be risin'
She'll find the note I left hangin'
On her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part
That says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before
[Verse 2]
By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be workin'
She'll prob'ly stop at lunch
And give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall
That's all
[Verse 3]
By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly
And call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know
I would really go
