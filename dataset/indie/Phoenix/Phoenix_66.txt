[Intro]
My father was a drinker and a fiend
And one night he goes off crazier than usual
Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself
He doesn't like that, not one bit
So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it
He turns to me and he says, "Why so serious?"
[Verse]
We smoke up like everyday
I got in with my K
Need the packs, I need the bricks
Runnin' fast, Ã¡ndale
Makin' money is the race, first place, on relay
Made lil mama count that cash, 'cause she know I do not play
And if homie move around, shooters gon' light up the place
Known killer in your town but with no face, no case, uh, uh

You flex like a hot boy
Showin' too much get you shot, boy

You could never kick it on my block, boy
And that's that 39 shit (39 shit)
