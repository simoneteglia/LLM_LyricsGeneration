[Verse 1]
You're pink, you're young, you're middle class
They say it doesn't matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
You're shooting up the ladder
[Chorus]
Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago
[Verse 2]
Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
Sometimes you stay in bed
Sometimes you go
"la-di-da-di-da-di-da-da"
Until your eyes roll back into your head
[Chorus]
Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago
[Post-Chorus]
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
[Chorus]
Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my god, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my god, it was a million years ago
[Post-Chorus]
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
[Outro]
You're dumbstruck, baby
