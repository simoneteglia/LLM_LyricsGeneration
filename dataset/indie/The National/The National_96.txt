I was in a fog, I didn't notice everything
Was coming all apart inside of me
There wasn't anyway for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me
There's a radiant darkness upon us
I don't want you to worry
I was careful but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry
You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what I didn't need
Everything's weird and we're always in danger
Why would you shatter somebody like me?
It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you won't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone
I'll do what I can to be a confident wreck
Can't feel this way forever, I mean
There wasn't any way for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me
There's a radiant darkness upon us
But I don't want you to worry
I was careful but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry
You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what I didn't need
Everything's weird and we're always in danger
Why would you shatter somebody like
It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you won't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone
It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you won't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone
