[Verse 1]
Say you stayed at home, alone with the flu
Find out from friends, that wasn't true
Go out at night with your headphones on, again
And walk through the Manhattan valleys of the dead
[Chorus]
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
[Refrain]
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
[Verse 2]
You said I came close as anyone's come
To live underwater for more than a month
You said it was night inside my heart, it was
You said it should tear a kid apart, it does
[Chorus]
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
[Refrain]
But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
[Bridge]
I had a hole in the middle where the lightning went through
I told my friends not to worry
I had a hole in the middle someone's sideshow to do
I told my friends not to worry
[Chorus]
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
Didn't wanna be your ghost
Didn't wanna be anyone's ghost
