[Verse: Berninger]
Losing my momentum, losing my mind
Not enough to mention, not enough time
I can't even say what it's about
All I am is shreds of doubt
And you don't know how to deal with me
You don't know how that feels
It all comes apart so easily
And you're running out of ideas
[Pre-Chorus: Berninger & Bridgers,
Bridgers
]
Everything melted in less than a week
Watching it felt like forever
The lights started dimming and then they went out
Heaven came down like a blanket
I can't even say what it's about
All I am is shreds of doubt
[Chorus: Berninger,
Berninger & Bridgers
]
So turn on the laugh track
Everyone knows you're a wreck
You're nevеr this quiet, your smile is cracking
You just haven't found what you'rе looking for yet
Turn on the laugh track
We'll see if it changes the scene
Maybe this is just the funniest version
Of us that we've ever been
[Bridge: Berninger & Bridgers]
I think our feet are gonna slip
I think our hands are gonna shake
I think our eyes are gonna cry
I think our hearts are gonna break
Maybe we'll never lighten up
Maybe this isn't gonna quit
I think it's never coming back
Maybe we've always been like this
[Chorus: Berninger & Bridgers]
So turn on the laugh track
Everyone knows you're a wreck
You're never this quiet, your smile is cracking
You just haven't found what you're looking for yet
Turn on the laugh track
We'll see if it changes the scene
Maybe this is just the funniest version
Of us that we've ever been
[Bridge: Bridgers,
Berninger & Bridgers
]
I think our feet are gonna slip
I think our hands are gonna shake
I think our eyes are gonna cry
I think our hearts are gonna break
Maybe we'll never lighten up
Maybe this isn't gonna quit
I think it's never coming back
Maybe we've always been like this
I think our feet are gonna slip
I think our hands are gonna shake
I think our eyes are gonna cry
I think our hearts are gonna break
[Chorus: Berninger & Bridgers]
So turn on the laugh track
Everyone knows you're a wreck
You're never this quiet, your smile is cracking
You just haven't found what you're looking for yet
Turn on the laugh track
We'll see if it changes the scene
