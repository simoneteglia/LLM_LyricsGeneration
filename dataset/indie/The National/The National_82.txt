[Chorus]
Well,
my mind's not right
, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
[Verse 1]
Abel, come on, give me the keys, man
Everything has all gone down wrong
Abel, come on, give me the keys, man
Everything has all gone down wrong
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I see water on the bridge
Well, you better hold my hand through this
Turn around, turn around, take me back, I can't calm down
Turn around, turn around, take me back, I can't calm down
[Chorus]
Well,
my mind's not right
, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
[Verse 2]
Abel, come on, give me a reason
I am not as bright as I could be
Abel, come on, take me with you
Everything has all gone down wrong
[Pre-Chorus 2]
You turn me good and God-fearing
Well, tell me what am I supposed to do with that?
I'm missing something
Yeah, I'm missing something
[Bridge]
My mind's gone loose inside its shell
My mind's gone loose inside the shell
Well, I'm missing something, yeah I'm missing something
Abel, my mind's gone loose inside the shell
[Chorus]
Well,
my mind's not right
, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
My mind's not right, my mind's not right
