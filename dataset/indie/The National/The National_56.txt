[Verse 1]
I'm put together beautifully
Big wet bottle in my fist
Big wet rose in my teeth
I'm a perfect piece of ass
Like every Californian
So tall I take over the street
With high-beams shining up my back
A wingspan unbelievable
I'm a festival
I'm a parade
[Hook]
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
[Verse 2]
I'm a birthday candle in a circle of black girls
God is on my side
Cause I'm the child-bride
I'm so sorry but the motorcade will have to go around me this time
Cause God is on my side
And
I'm the child-bride
[Hook]
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
[Bridge]
I carry the dollhouse safe on my shoulders
Through the black city
Night lights are on in the corners
And everyone's sleeping upstairs
All safe and sound, all safe and sound
I won't let the psychos around
All safe and sound
I won't let the psychos around
[Ending]
I'm in a state
I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love
I'm in a state
I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love
