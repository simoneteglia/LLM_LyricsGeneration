[Verse 1:
Lisa Hannigan
]
Lay down in the doorway in front of me
And make yourself impossible for me to leave
I remember a kid in the water, I remember a world on fire
I was just coming out of it, it was so hot all summer
[Chorus: Lisa Hannigan]
I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast
[Verse 2: Lisa Hannigan]
The storm, the blackout, the quiet sea
You went running right into it, away from me
We have friends in good houses, we have kids in the trees
Now I have nothing but sleepless nights, about everything
[Chorus: Lisa Hannigan]
I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast
[Verse 3: Matt Berninger & Lisa Hannigan]
Don't you know someday somebody will come and find you?
If you don't know who you are anymore, they will remind you
We don't see you around here anymore, it's okay
I will say your name out loud and you will be home
There are so many things that drive me crazy
What you think I am, it's never been me
Hearing you talk always saves me
Can you get away and talk to me?
[Outro: Brooklyn Youth Chorus]
I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast
