[Verse 1]
I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
[Refrain]
I need my girl
I need my girl
[Verse 2]
Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden?
You got out and said "I'm sorry"
To the vines and no one saw it
[Refrain]
I need my girl
I need my girl
[Bridge]
I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
[Verse 3]
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
[Refrain]
I need my girl
I need my girl
[Verse 4]
There's some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I tried to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
[Refrain]
I need my girl
I need my girl
[Bridge]
I'm under the gun again
I know I was a 45-percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
[Verse 5]
But I am good, and I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
