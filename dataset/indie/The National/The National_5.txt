Verse 1]
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holdin' on
It's holdin' on
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holdin' on
It's holdin' on
[Instrumental Break]
[Interlude]
It's holdin' on
It's holdin' on
Holdin' on
[Instrumental Break]
