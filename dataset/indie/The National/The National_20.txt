[Verse 1]
You're sleepin' night and day
How'd you do it
Me, I am wide awake
Feelin' defeated
[Chorus 1]
I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I know it's not workin',
I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
We just got nothin', nothin' left to say
[Verse 2]
Another year gets away
Another summer of love
I don't know why I care
We miss it every summer
[Chorus 2]
I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doin' this, there's no other way
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
I just got nothin', nothin' left to say
[Bridge]
It all, all
Catches up to me
It all, all
Catches up to me
All the time
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus 1]
I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I know it's not workin',
I'm no holiday
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
We just got nothin', nothin' left to say
[Chorus 2]
I say your name, I say I'm sorry
I'm the one doin' this, there's no other way
It's nobody's fault, no guilty party
I just got nothin', nothin' left to say
[Bridge]
It all, all
Catches up to me
It all, all
Catches up to me
All the time
[Instrumental Outro]
