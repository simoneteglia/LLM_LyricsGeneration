[Verse 1]
They're gonna send us to prison for jerks
For having vague ideas of the way to turn each other on again
They're gonna send us to prison for jerks
[Chorus]
They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my
[Verse 2]
We miss being ruffians, going wild and bright
In the corners of front yards, getting in and out of cars
We miss being deviants
[Chorus]
They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my
[Post-Chorus]
We can't stay here
We're starting to stay the same
We can't stay here
We can't stay this way
[Bridge]
Just tie your woman to your wrist
Give her the room to tie the other
[Chorus]
They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my
