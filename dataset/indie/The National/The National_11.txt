[Verse 1]
You said we're not so tied together
What did you mean?
Meet me in the stairwell in a second
For a glass of gin
[Chorus]
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
[Verse 2]
Can you remind me the building you live in?
I'm on my way
It's getting cold again but New York's gorgeous
It's a subway day
[Chorus]
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
[Bridge 1]
Why are we still out here holdin' our coats?
We look like children
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?
[Verse 3]
Hey, baby, where were you back there
When I needed your help?
I thought that if I stuck my neck out
I'd get you out of your shell
[Bridge 2]
My faith is sick
and
my skin is thin as ever
I need you alone
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?
[Chorus]
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
