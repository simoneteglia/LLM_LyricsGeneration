[Verse 1: Gail Ann Dorsey]
I'm your angel when it rains, dear
Heaven picks the place
I'm a child in that way, dear
Please do it again
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
I was hoping you wouldn't see me like this
I hate to fall before your feet again
I'm the rocks they weigh down the angels with
Help me see it won't always be like this
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
[Verse 3: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
You said you got to let me escape myself
You said I don't know how not to want something else
If I held your hand again, would you be here down on your knees like this?
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
[Outro: Gail Ann Dorsey,
Gail Ann Dorsey & Matt Berninger
]
I will love you like there's razors in it
And she'll love you like a radiant flame
There's never really any safety in it
Please do it again
There's never really any safety in it
