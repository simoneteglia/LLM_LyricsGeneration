[Verse 1]
I think this place is full of spies
I think they're onto me
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you?
Didn't anybody tell you how to gracefully disappear in a room?
[Chorus]
I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so, and now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
[Verse 2]
I think this place is full of spies
I think I'm ruined
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you?
Didn't anybody tell you this river's full of lost sharks?
[Chorus]
I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses
I know
And so, and now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
(I'm talking ace this morning)
[Outro]
And now, I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
