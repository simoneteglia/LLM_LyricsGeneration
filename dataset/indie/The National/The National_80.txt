[Part I]
[Verse 1]
It's a calculation I made a mistake on
I never should have said it like I said
It'll come to me later like a space invader
And I won't be able to get it out of my head
[Chorus]
What if I'd never written the letter
I slipped in the sleeve of the record I gave you?
What if I'd stayed on the C train until Lafayette?
What if we'd never met?
What if I'd only just done what you told me
And never looked back?
What if I'd only ducked away down the hallway
And faded to black?
[Verse 2]
It was too romantic, it was sad and frantic
A paperback book in the storm drain
It could go number one if I copied an earworm
From a melody that I wish I'd had
[Chorus]
What if I'd never written the letter
I slipped in the sleeve of the record I gave you?
What if I'd stayed on the C train until Lafayette?
What if we'd never met?
What if I'd only just done what you told me
And never looked back?
What if I'd only ducked away down the hallway
And faded to black?
What if I'd never written the letter
I slipped in the sleeve of the record I gave you?
What if I'd stayed on the C train until Lafayette?
What if we'd never met?
What if I'd only just done what you told me
And never looked back?
What if I'd only ducked away down the hallway
And faded to black?
[Outro]
It'll come to me later like a space invader
And I won't be able to get it out of my head
[Part II]
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Why'd I leave it like that?
Why'd I leave it like that?
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Why'd I leave it like that?
Why'd I leave it like that?
Why'd I leave it like that?
Why'd I leave it like that?
Why'd I leave it like that?
Why'd I leave it like that?
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Quarter after four in the morning
My heart's software gore
Why'd I leave it like that?
