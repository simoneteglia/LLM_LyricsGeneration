[Verse 1]
Karen, I'm not taking sides
I don't think I'll ever do that again
I'll end up winning and I won't know why
I'm really trying to shine here, I'm really trying
You're changing clothes and closing windows on me all the time
[Chorus]
Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone
[Verse 2]
Karen, we should call your father, maybe it's just a phase
He'll know the trick to get a wayward soul to change his ways
It's a common fetish, for a doting man, to ballerina on the coffee table cock in hand
[Chorus]
Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone
[Bridge]
Without warm water in my head
All I see is black and white and red
I feel mechanical and thin
Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title
[Verse 3]
Karen put me in a chair, fuck me and make me a drink
I lost direction and I'm past my peak
I'm telling you, this isn't me, no this isn't me
Karen believe me, you just haven't seen my good side yet
[Chorus]
Well whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do, listen, you'd better wait for me
No I wouldn't go out alone
[Bridge]
Without warm water in my head
All I see is black and white and red
I feel mechanical and thin
Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title
[Coda]
I must be me, I'm in my head
Black birds are circling my bed
I must be me, I must be me
Black feathers are falling on my feet
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest, protect the title
