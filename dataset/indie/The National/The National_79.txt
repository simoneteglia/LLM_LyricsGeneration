[Chorus]
Karen,
take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
[Verse 1]
I got five hundred in twenties, and I've got a ton of great ideas
I'm really worked up
I'm on a good mixture, I don't want to waste it
I'm on a good mixture, I do not want to waste it
I want to go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up
[Chorus]
Karen,
take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
[Refrain]
I have weird memories of you wearing long red socks and red shoes
I have weird memories
I have weird memories of you pissing in a sink, I think
I have weird memories of you
[Verse 2]
I want to go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up
I want to go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up
[Chorus]
Karen,
take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
[Refrain]
I have weird memories of you wearing long red socks and red shoes
I have weird memories
I have weird memories of you pissing in a sink, I think
I have weird memories of you
[Verse 2]
I want to go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up
I want to go gator around the warm beds of beginners
I'm really worked up
[Chorus]
Karen,
take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
Karen, take me to the nearest famous city middle where they hang the lights
Where it's random and it's common versus common,
la-de-la
[Refrain]
I have weird memories of you wearing long red socks and red shoes
I have weird memories
I have weird memories of you pissing in a sink, I think
I have weird memories of you
[Bridge]
Parking your car, you said "I'm overwhelmed"
You were thinking out loud, you said "I'm overwhelmed"
You were parking your car, you said "I'm overwhelmed"
You were thinking out loud, you said "I'm overwhelmed"
You said "I think I'm like Tennessee Williams"
I wait for the click; I wait, but it doesn't kick in
I think I'm like Tennessee Williams
I wait for the click; I wait, but it doesn't kick in
[Refrain]
I have weird memories of you wearing long red socks and red shoes
I have weird memories
I have weird memories of you pissing in a sink, I think
I have weird memories of you
I have weird memories of you
