[Refrain]
Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them
[Verse 1]
Take another sip of them
It floats around and takes me over
Like a little drop of ink
In a glass of water
[Chorus]
Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves
[Verse 2]
Cinderella through the room
I glide and swan
'Cause I'm the best slow dancer
In the universe
[Refrain]
Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them
[Chorus]
Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves
[Bridge]
Now I hardly know them
But I'll take my time
I'll carry them over
And I'll make them mine
[Chorus]
Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves
