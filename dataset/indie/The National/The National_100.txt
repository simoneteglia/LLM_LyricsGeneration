Hey, where the hell are you?
You don't call me back,
John
Won't you come here and stay with me?
Why don't you come here and stay with me?
Hey, where the hell are you?
You don't call me back, John
Won't you come here and stay with me?
Why don't you come here and stay with me?
Show up here loaded with bells on your toes
I don't care what you're into, I'll put
Velvet ropes around you, if that's what you need
Why did you listen to that man,
that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
Take his limousine, you gotta get back to me
[Chorus]
I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine
Na na na na na na na
Red hair and blue eyes
I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine
I was in a train under a river when I remembered what
What I wanted to tell you, man
What I wanted to tell you, man
I got two sets of headphones, I miss you like hell
Won't you come here and stay with me?
Why don't you come here and stay with me?
[Chorus]
I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine
Na na na na na na na
Red hair and blue eyes
I'm getting nervous
Na na na na na na na
No sign of a friend of mine
Na na na na na na na
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Oh, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
Fake a heart attack, you gotta get back to me
Why did you listen to that man, that man's a balloon
John, you gotta get out and get back to me
