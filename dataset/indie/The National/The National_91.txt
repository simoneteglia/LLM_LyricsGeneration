[Verse 1]
Build a fire for Val Jester
Build a room for your love
Take your time when you tell her
How she lives in your blood
[Chorus]
You should have looked after her better
You should have looked after her more
You should have locked the door
[Verse 2]
Fill her coat with weapons
And help her get it on
Cause one day when she goes
She's gone
[Chorus]
You should have held onto her better
You should have held onto her more
You should have locked the door
[Outro]
All the most important people in New York are nineteen
All the most important people in New York
All the most important people in New York are nineteen
All the most important people in New York
