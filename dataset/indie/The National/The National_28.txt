[Verse 1: Matt Berninger & Kate Stables]
How long have we been here?
Am I ever coming down?
I need to find some lower thinking, if I'm going to stick around
I'm not going anywhere
Who do I think I'm kidding?
I'm still standing in the same place where you left me standing
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Kate Stables]
I am easy to find
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger & Kate Stables]
"Towers to the skies, an academy of lies"
You never were much of a New Yorker
It wasn't in your eyes
If you ever come around this way again
You'll see me standing in the sunlight
In the middle of the street
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Kate Stables]
I am easy to find
I am easy to find
[Bridge: Matt Berninger & Kate Stables]
There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape
There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Kate Stables]
I am easy to find
I am easy to find
[Bridge: Matt Berninger & Kate Stables]
There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape
There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape
