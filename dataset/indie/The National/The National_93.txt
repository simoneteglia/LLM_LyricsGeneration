[Verse 1]
If you're ever sitting at the airport and you don't wanna leave
Don't even know what you're there for, send for me
If you're ever heartsick in an elevator full of bachelorettes
Cornered in and it's taking forever, please don't forget
[Chorus]
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me, I'll come and get you
Send for mе whenever, whеrever
[Verse 2]
If you're ever at a glass-top table selling your ideas
To swivel-chairing underlings who just don't see it
If you're singing in a song museum without a drop to drink
And you can't even make eye contact, can't even think
[Chorus]
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me, I'll come and get you
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me, I thought you'd never
Send for me whenever, wherever
[Bridge]
Run out, run out, run out to me now
Run out, run out, I'm pulling around
Run out, run out, run out, run out to me now
Run out, run out, run out to me now
Run out, run out, I'm pulling around
Run out, run out, run out, run out to me now
[Verse 3]
If you're ever in a psychiatric greenhouse with slip-on shoes
Wipe a smile on the shatterproof windows, I'll know what to do
If you're ever in a gift shop dying inside, filling up with tears
'Cause you thought of somebody you loved you haven't seen in years
[Chorus]
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me, I'll come and get you
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me, I thought you'd never
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me whenever, wherever
Send for me, I'll come and get you
Send for me whenever, wherever
