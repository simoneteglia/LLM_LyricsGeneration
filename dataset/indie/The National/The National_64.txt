[Intro]
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
I've got two armfuls of magazines for you
,
I'll bring 'em over
So hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you
[Refrain]
Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms
[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me
[Chorus]
My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me
[Verse 2]
Stay near your, stay near your television, set it up outside
And hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
Hang your holiday rainbow lights in the garden
And I'll, I'll bring a nice icy drink to you
[Refrain]
Let me come over, I can waste your time, I'm bored
Invite me to the war every night of the summer
And we'll play G.I. blood, G.I. blood
We'll stand by the pool, we'll throw out our golden arms
[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me
[Chorus]
My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
My angel face is falling
Feathers are falling on my feet
[Outro]
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me
Darling, can you tie my string?
Killers are calling on me
