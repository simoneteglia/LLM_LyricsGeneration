[Verse 1]
I think the kids are in trouble
Do not know what all the troubles are for
Give 'em ice for their fevers
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
Live on coffee and flowers
Try not to wonder what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Everything means everything
[Verse 2]
It's a Hollywood summer
You'd never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything
We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together 'til our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City
to all the silver girls
Everything means everything
[Chorus]
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
[Bridge]
I'm a confident liar
Have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be
I'll try to be more romantic
I want to believe in everything you believe
I was less than amazing
I do not know what all the troubles are for
Fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we'll leave the Silver City 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the Silver City to all the silver girls
Everything means everything
[Chorus]
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
I was afraid I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
