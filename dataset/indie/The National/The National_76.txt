[Verse 1]
Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt
Underline everything, I'm a professional
In my beloved white shirt
[Refrain]
I'm going down among the saints
[Chorus]
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria
[Verse 2]
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves
And I wanna rush in with the fools
[Chorus]
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor victoria, squalor victoria
[Refrain]
I'm going down among the saints
[Outro]
3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zonin' out, zonin' out, zonin' out, zoning out
3:30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zonin' out, zonin' out, zonin' out, zoning out
This isn't working, you, my middlebrow fuck-up
