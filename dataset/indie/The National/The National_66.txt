[Refrain]
We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more
[Verse 1]
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe
Behind a painting, lock it up and leave?
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
[Chorus]
Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
[Refrain]
We expected something, something better than before
We expected something more
[Verse 2]
You were always weird, but I never had to hold you
By the edges like I do now
You were always weird, but I never had to hold you
By the edges like I do now
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
[Chorus]
Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over again
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
[Outro]
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
