[Verse 1]
You have to do it running
But you do everything that they ask you to
'Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture
As long as you look far away
As long as you look removed
[Refrain]
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
[Chorus]
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes in eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults
[Verse 2]
Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts
So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves
So you swear
you just saw a feathery woman
Carry a blindfolded man through the trees
[Refrain]
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered
Fill yourself with quarters
[Chorus]
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes in eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults
You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night
Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes in eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch
Another un-innocent, elegant fall
Into the un-magnificent lives of adults
