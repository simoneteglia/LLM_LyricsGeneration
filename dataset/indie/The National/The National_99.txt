[Instrumental break]
[Verse 1]
I remember well; it was long ago
And it's true there's things these photographs don't show
When she took my hand, dreaming as we ran
We use the stars in the sky as our map
[Chorus]
Singin' oo-oo-ooh, if you'll be mine
Then oo-oo-ooh, we will climb
Because we belong here with the Great Tetons
[Verse 2]
Well we made our way up to the treeline
When the cloud fell down and covered us in white
And the world below was like a rolling sea
So we watched from the tallest peak
[Chorus]
And we were singing oo-oo-ooh, if you'll be mine
Then oo-oo-ooh, we will climb
Because we belong here with the Great Tetons
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
Oo-oo-ooh, if you'll be mine
Then oo-oo-ooh, we will climb
Cause oo-oo-ooh, you and I
We belong here with the Great Tetons
Yes, we belong here with the Great Tetons
