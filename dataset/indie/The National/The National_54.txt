[Verse 1]
I'm in the city you hated, my eyes are falling
Counting the clicks with the living dead,
my eyes are red
I'm in the crush and I hate it, my eyes are falling
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I'll try to keep my skeletons in
Is it weird to be back in the South? And can they even tell
If the city girl was ever there, or anywhere?
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I'll try to keep my skeletons in
I'll be a friend and a fuck-up
and everything
But I'll never be anything you ever want me to be
[Chorus]
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
[Verse 2]
I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me
It'll be easy to cover, gather my skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas before I realize
[Verse 3]
I don't want you to grieve, but I want you to sympathize, alright
I can't blame you for losing your mind for a little while, so did I
I don't want you to change, but I want you to recognize that I
It'll be easy to cover, gather your skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas before you realize
That I'll never be anything you ever want me to be
[Chorus]
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
