[Verse 1]
Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
Lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
I lift my shirt up
[Pre-Chorus]
I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me
[Verse 2]
Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
I take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
Take it too far
[Chorus]
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are fallin' down from everybody I know
[Post-Chorus]
I'm on a blood buzz, yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God I am
I'm on a blood buzz
[Pre-Chorus]
I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me
[Chorus]
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are fallin' down from everybody I know
[Post-Chorus]
I'm on a blood buzz, yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God I am
I'm on a blood buzz
