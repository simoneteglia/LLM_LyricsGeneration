[Verse 1]
I've been dragging around
From the end of your coat for two weeks
Everywhere you go is swirling
Everything you say has water under it
You know I keep your fingerprints
In a pink folder in the middle of my table
You're the tall kingdom I surround
Think I better follow you around
[Chorus]
You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy, brainy, brainy
[Verse 2]
I've been dragging around
From the end of your coat for two weeks
You keep changing your fancy, fancy mind
Every time I decide to let it go
I was up all night again
Boning up and reading the American dictionary
You'll never believe me what I found
Think I better follow you around
[Chorus]
You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love
, brainy, brainy, brainy
You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love,
brainy, brainy, brainy
