[Verse 1]
I wasn't starting yet
I didn't even think you were listening
I wasn't ready at all
To say anything about anything interesting
It's a thing you have
You just don't know that you do it
You wait around in a conversation
While I get in and start stumbling through it
[Chorus]
I was so distracted then
I didn't have it straight in my head
I didn't have my face on yet or the role or the feel
Of where I was going with it all
I was suffering more than I let on
The tropic morning news was on
There's nothing stopping me now
From saying all the painful parts out loud
[Verse 2]
Got to my feet
Feeling that I'd let you down
Wanted to say it slow and perfect
But it all somehow got switched around
Something went off on its own
My dumb, automatic chit-chat
It's not what I meant to say at all
There's no way you can attach me to that
[Chorus]
Got up to seize the day
With my head in my hands feeling strange
When all my thinking got mangled
And I caught myself
talking myself off the ceiling
I was suffering more than I let on
The tropic morning news was on
There's nothing stopping me now
From saying all the painful parts out loud
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, where are all the moments we'd have?
Oh, where's the brain we shared?
Something somehow has you rapidly improving
Oh, what happened to the wavelength we were on?
Oh, where's the gravity gone?
Something somehow has you rapidly improving
[Bridge]
You found the ache in my argument
You couldn't wait to get out of it
You found the slush in my sentiment
You made it sound so intelligent
You can stop and start an athlete's heart
How do I feel about it?
I would love to have nothing to do with it
I would like to move on and be through with it
[Verse 3]
I'll be over here lying near the ocean
Making ocean sounds
Let me know if you can come over
And work the controls for a while
[Chorus]
I was so distracted then
I didn't have it straight in my head
I didn't have my face on yet or the role or the feel
Of where I was going with it all
I was suffering more than I let on
The tropic morning news was on
There's nothing stopping me now
From saying all the painful parts out loud
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, where are all the moments we'd have?
Oh, where's the brain we shared?
Something somehow has you rapidly improving
Oh, what happened to the wavelength we were on?
Oh, where's the gravity gone?
Something somehow has you rapidly improving
