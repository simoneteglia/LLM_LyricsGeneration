[Verse 1]
Oh my Mother, let your daughter dance with me
I'd like to spin her wild around the cottonwood tree
There's somethin' 'bout her eyes, I think her roots are rotten
This must be the reason she wears her hair up in knots, oh no
[Pre-Chorus]
This is so embarrassin', ah, we're pissin' fits
Cryin' on our doorsteps in T-shirts loose and ripped
Some of them so out of style I cannot save them
They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them
[Chorus]
Keep the weed next to the bed,
then light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower,
hide your backbone
, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head,
you have to get this turtleneck
[Verse 2]
The poor, they leave their cellphones in the bathrooms of the rich
And when they try to turn 'em off everything they switch to
Is just another man
in shitty suits
everybody's cheerin' for
This must be the genius we've been waitin' years for, oh no
[Pre-Chorus]
This is so embarrassin', ah, we're pissin' fits
Cryin' on our doorsteps in T-shirts loose and ripped
Some of them so out of style I cannot save them
They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them
[Chorus]
Keep the weed next to the bed,
then light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower,
hide your backbone
, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head,
you have to get this turtleneck
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Keep the weed next to the bed,
then light the water, check for lead
Dim the lights a little lower,
hide your backbone
, shrug your shoulders
Give the gift that fits your head,
you have to get this turtleneck
