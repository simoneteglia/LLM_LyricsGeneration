[Verse 1]
This machine's a backwards thinker
That looks for you until its neck hurts
Not so hard to be a person
If you've got something you can reference
[Refrain]
Grease in your hair
Fingernail polish
Water balloon eyes
Totally honest
[Verse 2]
I've worked up a sincere speech
I just don't know how I'm gonna say it
The second I stand up, I freeze
My only move here is to fail
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't splash apart
Everything changes
All jumbled up
Wide-open spaces
Grease in your hair
Fingernail polish
Water balloon eyes
Totally honest
[Chorus]
Down we go on thе grass
Magnets make machines go crazy
I usеd to know you well
You give me such a future feeling
We're in the middle of
Some kind of cosmic rearrangement
You were so funny then
And I kept thinking I would catch it
[Bridge]
Stay in one state
Nothing is stable
Whip on a cape
Step on a cable
I have no more feeling for it
I have no more frame of mind
I have no more feeling for it
I have no more frame of mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Grease in your hair
Fingernail polish
Water balloon eyes
Totally honest
Don't splash apart
Everything changes
All jumbled up
Wide open spaces
[Chorus]
Down we go on the grass
Magnets make machines go crazy
I used to know you well
You give me such a future feeling
We're in the middle of
Some kind of cosmic rearrangement
You were so funny then
And I kept thinking I would catch it
[Outro]
And I kept thinking I would catch it
And I kept thinking I would catch it
And I kept thinking I would catch it
And I kept thinking I would catch it
