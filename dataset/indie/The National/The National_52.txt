[Verse 1]
Be still for a second while I try and try to pin your flowers on
La, la, la, la, la
Can you carry my drink? I have everything else
I can tie my tie all by myself
I'm getting tired, I'm forgetting why
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're so disarming, darling, everything we did believe
Is diving, diving, diving, diving off the balcony
[Chorus]
Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
[Verse 2]
Hold ourselves together with our arms around the stereo for hours
La, la, la, la, la, la
While it sings to itself, or whatever it does
When it sings to itself of its long lost loves
I'm getting tired, I'm forgetting why
[Chorus]
Tired and wired, we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
But I'll be with you behind the couch when they come
On a different day just like this one
[Outro]
We'll stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz for days
We'll stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz
So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume
Stay inside 'til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz
So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume on
