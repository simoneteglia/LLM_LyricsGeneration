[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
I'm your hospital, I’m your silver cross
Tell me what to be, tell me how to talk
Patti wasn't lonely, Robert wasn't lost
Put me on a rope, take me for a walk
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
Roman holiday
Every time it rains
Roman holiday
I’ll take away your shame
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
I'm not afraid to tell you what I want
I'm not afraid of anything, I want it all
Never leave me out here for too long
Put me in your movie, pin me to your wall
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
Roman holiday
Every time it rains
Roman holiday
We're all Rainey anyway
[Bridge: Matt Berninger and
Gail Ann Dorsey
]
She said, "
Please, think the best of him
Please, think the best of me
There are police in the museum
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
Roman holiday
Every time it rains
Roman holiday
We don't feel the pain
[Bridge: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
She said, "Please, think the best of him"
Please, think the best of me
[Outro: Matt Berninger]
There are police in the museum
She said please
