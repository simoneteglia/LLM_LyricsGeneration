[Verse 1]
My bodyguard shows her revolver to anyone who asks
And yeah, she comes to attention when you come up to me too fast
For a little while you'll be here, the only good part of me
For a little while you'll be here
[Chorus]
So
lit up, lit up, lit up
alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie
[Verse 2]
You wear your skirt like a flag
And everything surrounds you, and it doesn't fade
Nothing like this sound I make
That only lasts the season
And only heard by bedroom kids who buy it for that reason
'Cause you're the low life of the party, bad blood
Bad blood for everybody
I'm in control and I believe
[Chorus]
So
lit up, lit up, lit up
alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie from your bad blood
From your bad blood
[Bridge]
'Cause you're the low life of the party, bad blood
Bad blood for everybody
I'm in control and I believe
[Chorus]
So lit up, lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up, lit up alright
I try to untie
