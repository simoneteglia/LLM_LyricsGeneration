[Verse 1: Matt Berninger,
Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers
]
I cannot believe what you get away with
You find beauty in anything
Whenever you look down into a sewer
You see a diamond ring
It isn't fair how you never look like you're trying
As if you couldn't care any less
And I'm here, kicking myself to keep from crying
You say you're impressed
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers]
But this isn't helping at all
It only makes me wanna get further off
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helping
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger,
Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers
]
You say that this doesn't have to hurt
You're there if you need to be found
Can't you see that that makes it so much worse?
I'll always see you around
Maybe, in time, we can give it one morе try
But let's think about what matters now
Keep kickin' yourself to keep from crying
That, you'rе so right about
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers]
'Cause this isn't helping at all
I know you think it's kindness, but it's not
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helping
[Bridge: Matt Berninger,
Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers
]
Don't say that it's all your fault
I know you're bankin' on it comin' up
But would your life be so bad
If you knew every single thought I had?
'Cause I only have two things to say to you
But you say two things about everything
, babe
Well, just when I thought
You don't even notice me at all
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers]
'Cause this isn't helping at all
It only makes me wanna get further off
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helping
This isn't helping at all
I know you think it's kindness, but it's not
This isn't helping at all
This isn't helping
