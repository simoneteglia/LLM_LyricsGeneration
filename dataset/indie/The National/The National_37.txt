[Verse 1: Matt Berninger,
Mina Tindle
,
Both
]
It's almost like you’re not afraid of anything I do
How I want you here
You don't know what it's like to be around you
I still got my fear
[Pre-Chorus: Mina Tindle]
It’s the way you say yes when I ask you to marry me
You don't know what you are doing
Do you think you can carry me over this threshold
Over and over again into oblivion?
It's the way that you're gonna stop needing to tell me
You want me as much as I want you to tell me
I'm over the threshold
Everything is gonna be totally okay into oblivion
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Mina Tindle]
I still got my fear
I still got my fear
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger and Mina Tindle]
It's still always you every morning I think of no matter what
How I want you here
I know I am easy to find but you know it's never me
I still got my fear
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Berninger & Mina Tindle,
Mina Tindle
]
It's like a tide in the city lifts me and carries me around
And oh, my mind is made up out of nothing now
If nothing scares you about me and you, never put me down
Oh, my
mi
nd is made up out of nothing now
[Bridge: Matt Berninger and Mina Tindle]
You won’t walk away, won’t you?
You don't walk away, don’t you?
You won't walk away, won't you?
You don't walk away, don’t you?
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Mina Tindle,
Mina Tindle
]
I still got my fear
I still got my fear
I still got my fear
I still got my fear
(
I still got my
I still got my
I still got my
I still got my
)
