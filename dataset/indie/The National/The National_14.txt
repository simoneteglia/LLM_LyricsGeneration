[Verse 1]
I was a worm, I was a creature
I get on the ground the second I'd see you
You cannot command your love
I wasn't a catch, I wasn't a keeper
I was walkin' around like I was the one who found dead John Cheever
Hand in glove
[Chorus 1]
So blame it on me, I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
[Verse 2]
I see you in stations and on invitations
You'd fall into rivers with friends on the weekends
Innocent skies above
Carin at the liquor store, I can't wait to see you
I'm walkin' around like I was the one who found
dead John Cheever
In the house of love
[Chorus 2]
So blame it on me, I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
It wasn't so bad, I wasn't that sick, got taken by love, I wasn't that quick
A foregone conclusion
It's gonna be different after tonight,
you're gonna see me in a different light
It's a foregone conclusion
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 3]
So blame it on me, I really don't care
It's a foregone conclusion
I'm already seein' stars in the air
It's a foregone conclusion
