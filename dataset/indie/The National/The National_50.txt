[Verse 1]
You've been sleepin' for miles
So what did you see?
Here the sky's been fallin' white flowers
And there's ice in all the trees
I've been tappin' the table
I've been hopin' to drink
There's a line that goes all the way
From my childhood to you
[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?
[Verse 2]
I've been tryin' to see where you're goin', but you're so hard to follow
And I don't think we're getting anywhere any time soon
We have so much to cover and I don't know what I'm expectin'
You keep sayin' so many things that I wish you won't
[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I've been talkin' 'bout you to myself 'cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want, and I want everything
I want everything
I've been talkin' 'bout you to myself 'cause there's nobody else
And I want what I want, and I want everything
I want everything
[Chorus]
Can't you find a way?
Can't you find a way?
You are in this too
Can't you find a way?
