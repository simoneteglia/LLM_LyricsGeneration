[Verse 1]
Crushed on the train, we'd stand by the window
We sweat through the hot parts of June
We hugged it out and ducked it on purpose
Nothin' else I needed to do
[Chorus]
I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you
[Verse 2]
Later that year in the back of
the Warsaw
I thought you and I might be okay
Spinnin' and quiet,
you leaned in against me
Said, "I'm gonna have it all someday"
[Chorus]
I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you
I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you
[Bridge]
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
[Verse 3]
New York is older and changin' its skin again
It dies every ten years, and then it begins again
If your heart was in it, I'd stay a minute
I'm dyin' to be taken apart
[Chorus]
I was born, oh-oh
To beg for you
I was born, oh-oh, oh
To beg for you
[Bridge]
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
I'd cry, crawl, I'd do it all
Teakettle love, I'd do anything
[Instrumental Outro]
