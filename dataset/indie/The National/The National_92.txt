[Chorus: Brooklyn Youth Chorus]
Her father's voice
Her mother's heartbeat
The orange color inside her eyelids
The sunlight on her skin
Dust swirls in strange light
[Post-Chorus: Brooklyn Youth Chorus]
The feeling of the rug on her body
The hum from the speakers
She learns how to lie
[Chorus: Brooklyn Youth Chorus]
Her father's voice
Her mother's heartbeat
The orange color inside her eyelids
The sunlight on her skin
Dust swirls in strange light
[Post-Chorus: Brooklyn Youth Chorus]
The feeling of the rug on her body
The hum from the speakers
She learns how to lie
She learns how to lie
She learns how to lie
She learns
[Bridge: Brooklyn Youth Chorus]
The feeling of anger
The end of her street
Time in buildings
Time in cars
Could she run forever?
Could she run forever?
[Outro: Brooklyn Youth Chorus]
Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange light
