[Verse 1]
The first time I saw you, you were walkin' out
I wanted to ask if you could stay
But you were on somethin' with your friends around
There was nothin' I could say
[Chorus]
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
[Verse 2]
The next time I saw you, you were breakin' down
A million years had gone away
You looked right at me, and I just turned around
There was still nothin' I could say
[Chorus]
But I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
[Bridge]
I have dreams of
anonymous castrati
Singin' to us from the trees
I have dreams of first man and first lady
Singin' to us
from the sea
[Chorus]
So I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
I'm gonna keep you in love with me for a while
I'm gonna keep you in love with me
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I have dreams of
anonymous castrati
Singin' to us from the trees
I have dreams of first man and first lady
Singin' to us
from the sea
[Instrumental Outro]
