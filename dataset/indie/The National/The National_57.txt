[Verse: Eve Owens, Aaron Dessner & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Is she outside?
Is she lookin' out?
Is she standin' up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where are her feet?
Where is her head?
Is she outside?
Is she lookin' out?
Is she standin' up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
Is she lookin' out?
Is she standin' up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where are her feet?
Where is her head?
Is she outside?
Is she lookin' out?
Is she standin' up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
What is she thinkin'?
Is she sleepin'?
What did she say?
Is she lookin' out?
Is she standin' up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
Is she lookin' out?
Is she sleepin'?
[Bridge: Matt Berninger,
Eve Owens with Aaron Dessner & Gail Ann Dorsey
]
I think I'm hittin' a wall, I
Hate lovin' you as much as I do
I think I'm runnin' away, I
Feel the dark storm you bring, I can't take another day
I think I'm hittin' a wall, I think I'm hittin' a wall (
Is she outside?
)
I hate my looks, I hate 'em all (
Is she lookin' out?
)
I think I'm runnin' away (
Is she standin' up?
)
The storm you bring, can't take another day (
Where are her hands?
)
I think I'm hittin' a wall, I think I'm hittin' a wall (
Where are her eyes? Where are her feet?
)
I hate lovin' you as much as I do (
Where is her head?
)
I think I'm runnin' away, I think I'm runnin' away (
Is she outside? Is she lookin' out?
)
I think I hate my looks, I hate 'em all (
Is she standin' up?
)
I think I'm hittin' a wall (
Where are her hands?
)
(
Where are her eyes?
)
(
Where is her head?
)
(
What is she thinkin'?
)
(
Is she sleepin'?
)
[Outro: Eve Owens with Aaron Dessner & Gail Ann Dorsey,

]
Where are her hands? (
And I
)
Where are her eyes? (
Will not come back the same
)
Where is her head?
What is she thinkin'?
Is she sleepin'? (
And I
)
What did she say? (
Will not come back the same
)
Where are her eyes?  (
And I
)
Where is her head? (
Will not come back the same
)
What is she thinkin'?
Is she sleepin'?
What did she say? (
And I
)
Is she growin' up? (
Will not come back the same
)
Is she lookin' out?
Is she standin' up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where are her feet?
Where is her head?
Is she outside?
Is she lookin' out?
Is she standin' up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
What is she thinkin'?
Is she sleepin'?
What did she say?
Is she growin' up?
Is she growin' up?
Is she growin' up?
