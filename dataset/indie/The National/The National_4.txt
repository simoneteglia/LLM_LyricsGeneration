[Verse 1]
I couldn't find quiet, I went out in the rain
I was just soaking my head to unrattle my brain
Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
I didn't understand then, I don't understand now
[Chorus]
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?
[Post-Chorus]
And everybody was gone
You were staring down the street 'cause you were trying not to crack up
[Verse 2]
It wasn't like a rain, it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me
Well, I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, it's frightening
[Chorus]
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about
When you're sitting in your fainting chair, drinking pink rabbits?
[Post-Chorus]
And everybody was gone
I was staring down the street 'cause I was trying not to crack
[Bridge]
I was solid gold, I was in the fight
I was coming back from what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see you coming so far
I just turn around and there you are
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me, I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
[Post-Chorus]
And everybody was gone
You were standing in the street 'cause you were trying not to crack up
And Bona Drag was still on
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
[Outro]
You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all (When the sound kicks out)
You said it would be painless
A needle in a doll (When the sound kicks out)
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
