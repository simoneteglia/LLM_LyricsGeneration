[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
Don't make this any harder
Everybody’s waitin'
Walk-on's almost over
Teenagers on ice
Try to keep my distance
Talkin’ of forgiveness
Once upon a poolside
Underneath the lights
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Sufjan Stevens]
What was the worried thing you said to me?
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
I'll follow you everywhere
While you work the room
I don't know how you do it
Tangerine perfume
I'm not doin' anyone
Any kind of favors
Watchin' airplanes land
And sink into the pavement
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Sufjan Stevens]
What was the worried thing you said to me?
[Bridge: Matt Berninger]
I can't keep talking, I can't stop shakin’
I can’t keep track of everything I'm taking
Everything is different, why do I feel the same?
Am I asking for too much? Can’t hеar what you're sayin'
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Sufjan Stevens]
What was the worried thing you said to mе?
I thought we could make it through anything
[Bridge: Matt Berninger]
This is the closest we've ever been
And I have no idea what’s happenin'
Is this how this whole thing is gonna end?
This is the closest we've ever been
[Verse 3: Matt Berninger]
Don't make this any harder
Everybody's waitin'
Walk-on's almost over
Teenagers on ice
Try to keep my distance
Talkin' of forgiveness
Once upon a poolside
Underneath the lights
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Sufjan Stevens]
What was the worried thing you said to me?
I thought we could make it through anything
