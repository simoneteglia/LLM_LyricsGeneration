[Verse 1]
I found you in the summer heat, of 1953
Wise words from your father said
"I know that boy's your brother's friend
But I don't think he keeps comin' round for him"
Again and again and again
[Verse 2]
I had to swim away
Semper Fi, but I'll be back someday
I'll take you by the hand and say
"Be mine, be mine, be mine"
[Chorus]
And if someday, you grow tired and your memory fades
It's alright, I will never leave your side
And oh when it's time, you can come find me
In 1953
[Verse 3]
Leave New York and see the countryside
Little city and a bigger life
Watch it grow into a thousand eyes
It's ours, it's ours, it's ours
Oh it's ours, it's ours, it's ours
[Chorus]
And if someday, you grow tired and your memory fades
It's alright, I will never leave your side
And oh when it's time, you can come find me
In 1953
[Dialogue]
"And he was my brother's friend, years later my father said
You know, I think he's comin' to see you"
[Bridge]
It's written in the gold ring
[Dialogue]
"That could be true"
"It is true"
[Bridge cont]
Passed down the light
Hangin' in the branches
[Dialogue]
"We landed on the right path I really feel"
[Bridge cont]
You see it in their eyes
Pressed in the concrete
[Dialogue]
"But it was a good life, I'm very happy"
[Bridge cont]
Where we used to reside
It's larger than life
[Chorus]
And if someday, you grow tired and your memory fades
It's alright, I will never leave your side
And oh when it's time, you can come find me
In 1953
