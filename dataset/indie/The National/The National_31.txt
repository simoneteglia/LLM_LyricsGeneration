[Verse 1]
I used to fall asleep to you talking to me
I don't listen to anything now
Nothing to do with us
I'm just so tired of thinking about everything
I'm not afraid of being alone
I just don't know what to do with my time
Between you and me, I thought it would all last a little while longer
[Chorus]
But I'm learning to lie here in the quiet light
While I watch the sky go from black to grey
Learning how not to die inside a little every time
I think about you and wonder if you are awake
[Verse 2]
You don't know anything
I think about you way more than anything else
I'm not that spiritual I still go out all the time to department stores
Everything I need, but none of this is getting me anywhere good
Between you and me I still fall apart at the thought of your voice
[Chorus]
But I'm learning to lie here in the quiet light
While I watch the sky go from black to grey
Learning how not to die inside a little every time
I think about you and wonder if you are awake
And I'm learning to live without the heartache it gives me
Nothing I wouldn't do for another few minutes
Learning how not to cry every time there's another sad unbearable morning
But sometimes there's nothing I can do
[Bridge]
I can't help it
It's you that I think I hear in the quiet light
Am I crazy?
You're nowhere near me, guess I don't know what I'm saying
Just call me, I'll come to where you are alone in the quiet light
I'm always thinking you're behind me
And I turn around and you're always there
[Chorus]
But I'm learning to lie here in the quiet light
While I watch the sky go from black to grey
Learning how not to die, inside a little every time
I think about you and wonder if you are awake
And I'm learning to live without the heartache it gives me
Nothing I wouldn't do for another few minutes
Learning how not to cry every time there's another sad unbearable morning
But sometimes there's nothing I can do
