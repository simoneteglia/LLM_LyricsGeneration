[Verse 1]
So happy I was invited
Gave me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' and dyin' in New York, it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins in colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough
[Refrain]
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
[Chorus]
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
[Verse 2]
This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
It takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a
summer lovin' torture party
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too tired to drive anywhere
Anyway right now, do you care if I stay?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough
[Chorus]
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
[Refrain]
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
