[Chorus 1]
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
[Post-Chorus]
This quiet company
This quiet company
[Chorus 1]
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
[Post-Chorus]
This quiet company
This quiet company
This quiet company
[Verse 1]
And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes a while to settle down
My shivered bones
Until the panic's out
[Chorus 2]
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
[Post-Chorus]
Company
This quiet company
This quiet company
[Verse 2]
But I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole
I said I would but then I saw
Your shivered bones
They didn't want me to
[Chorus 1]
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walkin' in
[Chorus 2]
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
[Instrumental Outro]
