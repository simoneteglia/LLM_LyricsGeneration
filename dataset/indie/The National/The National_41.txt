[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete at the softest stages
[Refrain: Matt Berninger]
I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwing towels into water
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
Get it down to nothing, everything that matters
Fever flashes, eyelashes and traffic patterns
Humidity, history, chemistry and panic
Swimsuits in the windows of electric minivans
[Refrain: Matt Berninger & Justin Vernon]
I don't know why I don't try harder
I've been going down some, some strange water
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Berninger & Justin Vernon,
Matt Berninger
]
Move forward now,
there's nothing to do
Can't turn around,
I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car, I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Justin Vernon]
It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, my windshield's cryin'
I'm feeling sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped
The grief, it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creeping, I think it's dyin'
I'm pulling over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
[Bridge: Matt Berninger]
What was I even leaving for?
I keep going back and forth
I think now I'm about to see
Didn't know how sad it'd be
[Verse 3: Matt Berninger]
Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know when I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete at the softest stages
[Refrain: Matt Berninger & Justin Vernon]
I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwing towels into water
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Berninger & Justin Vernon,
Matt Berninger
]
Move forward now,
there's nothing to do
Can't turn around
and I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car, I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Justin Vernon]
It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, the windshield's cryin'
I'm feeling sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped
The grief, it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creeping, I think it's dyin'
I'm pulling over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
The grief, it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creeping, I think it's dyin'
I'm pulling over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
