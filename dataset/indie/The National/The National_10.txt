[Verse 1]
Don't make me read your mind
You should know me better than that
It takes me too much time
You should know me better than that
You're not that much like me
You should know me better than that
We have different enemies
But you should know me better than that
[Pre-Chorus]
I should leave it alone, but you're not right
I should leave it alone, but you're not right
[Verse 2]
Can't you write it on the wall?
You should know me better than that
There's no room to write it all
You should know me better than that
Can you turn the TV down?
You should know me better than that
There's too much crying in the sound
I should know you better than that
[Pre-Chorus]
I should leave it alone, but you're not right
I should leave it alone, but you're not right
[Chorus]
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind
[Verse 3]
You think about something so much
You should know me better than that
Start to slide outta touch
You should know me better than that
Tell yourself it's only noise
You should know me better than that
Learn to appreciate the void
You should know me better than that
[Chorus]
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind
[Chorus]
I should live in salt for leaving you behind, behind
