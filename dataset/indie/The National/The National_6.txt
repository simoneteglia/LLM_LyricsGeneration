[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
[Verse 1]
Maybe I listen more than you think
And I can tell that somebody sold you
We said we'd never let anyone in
We said we'd only die of lonely secrets
[Chorus]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hidin' from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talkin' to God
[Verse 2]
I thought that this would all work out after a while
Now you're sayin' that I'm askin' for too much attention
Also no other faith is light enough for this place
We said we'd only die of lonely secrets
[Chorus]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hidin' from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talkin' to God
[Post-Chorus]
And I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
The system only dreams in total darkness
Why are you hidin' from me?
We're in a different kind of thing now
All night you're talkin' to God
[Post-Chorus]
And I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
I cannot explain it, oh
Any other, any other way
