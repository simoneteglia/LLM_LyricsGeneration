[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
I like the old way, I thought I was hanging in there
You held back the worst rain from my shoulders then
[Chorus]
What are we going through, you and me?
Every other house on the street's burning
What are we going through? Wait and see
Days of
brutalism
and
hairpin turns
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
Your nervous throat clicks and my spirit swims right to the hook
You go quiet and leave me in the wake of a terrifying look
[Chorus: Matt Berninger and Gail Ann Dorsey]
What are we going through, you and me?
What is it you want me to be learning?
We're always arguing about the same things
Days of brutalism and hairpin turns
[Verse 3: Matt Berninger]
Say it like I was right in the room there
Say it like your head was on my shoulder
(And I'll keep my eyes open)
[Chorus]
What are we going through, you and me?
Every other house on the street's burning
What are we going through? Wait and see
Days of brutalism and hairpin turns
What are we going through, you and me?
What is it you want me to be learning?
We're always arguing about the same things
Days of brutalism and hairpin turns
[Outro: Kate Stables and Mina Tindle]
And I'll keep my eyes open
And I'll keep my eyes open
