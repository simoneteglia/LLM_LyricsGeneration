[Verse 1]
What does it mean when
Your arms fall asleep? And
How do you get rid of hornets
Before the weekend?
When did they say we should
Turn back the clocks?
Why do they always say everything's for the best
When everybody knows it's not?
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna talk
Because I don't wanna fight
We always get bogged down in the heavy shit
You know what it's like
[Verse 3]
But I don't wanna leave
And I don't wanna hide
I just don't wanna run
Into you tonight
I need to decide
What to do with my hands
Turn you into a spiderweb again
Something everybody understands
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna talk
Because I don't wanna fight
Wе always get bogged down in the hеavy shit
You know what it's like
[Verse 4]
I don't need to be rescued
I just need to be pinned
God's in the decals
And the words on your skin
Not being in love with you
It isn't easy to fake
When I don't know if you're ever gonna come back
From your cigarette break
[Verse 1]
What does it mean when
Your arms fall asleep? And
How do you get rid of hornets
Before the weekend?
When did they say we should
Turn back the clocks?
Why do they always say everything's for the best
When everybody knows it's not?
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna talk to you
Because I don't wanna fight
We always get bogged down in the heavy shit
You know what it's like
[Verse 3]
But I don't wanna leave
And I don't wanna hide
I just don't wanna run
Into you tonight
I need to decide
What to do with my hands
Turn you into a spiderweb again
Something everybody understands
