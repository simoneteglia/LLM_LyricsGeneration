[Verse 1]
Every time you get a drink
And every time you go to sleep
Are those dreams inside your head?
Is that sunlight on your bed?
[Verse 2]
Every time you're driving home
Way outside your safety zone
Wherever you will ever be
You're never getting rid of me
[Chorus]
You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
[Verse 3]
You could've made a safer bet
But what you break is what you get
You wake up in the bed you make
I think you made a big mistake
[Chorus]
You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
You own me
Lucky you
You own me
There's nothing you can do
[Bridge]
You clean yourself to meet
A man who isn't me
You're putting on a shirt
A shirt I'll never see
The letter's in your coat
And no one's in your head
'Cause you're too smart to remember
You're too smart
Lucky you
Lucky you
Lucky you
