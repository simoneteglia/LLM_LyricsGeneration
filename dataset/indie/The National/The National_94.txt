[Verse 1]
Cartoons from a television
Whistles from the street
Blackout curtains, summer sirens
Electricity
[Refrain]
I don't need ice machines, I don't need speaker systems
I don't need white lights blinking
I don't need you to witness, I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need anything
[Verse 2]
Finally start to make connections
When everything goes dark
It's pulling me in all directions
It's tearing you apart
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need ice machines, I don't need speaker systems
I don't need white lights blinking
I don't need you to witness, I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need anything
But I do
[Chorus]
What am I doing watching clocks?
Space is too empty, this room's too hot
What am I doing wandering halls?
Ringing doorbells, pounding walls
[Verse 3]
I don't know what to say to people
It only makes things worse
It's timе to take my silent treatmеnt
This won't be the first
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need ice machines, I don't need speaker systems
I don't need white lights blinking
I don't need you to witness, I don't need your forgiveness
I don't need anything
But I do
[Chorus]
What am I doing watching clocks?
Space is too empty, this room's too hot
What am I doing wandering halls?
Ringing doorbells, pounding walls?
[Bridge]
A rock that fell from orbit
I roll across the carpet, under
Frozen flowers on the walls
Leaning on my shoulders
[Chorus]
What am I doing watching clocks?
Space is too empty, this room's too hot
What am I doing wandering halls?
Ringing doorbells, pounding walls?
What am I doing watching clocks?
Space is too empty, this room's too hot
What am I doing wandering halls?
Ringing doorbells, pounding walls?
What am I doing watching clocks?
Space is too empty, this room's too hot
What am I doing wandering halls?
Ringing doorbells, pounding walls?
