[Verse 1]
Gold light breaks behind the houses
I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me
I can hardly stand up right
I hit my head upon the light
I have faith but don't believe it
It's not there enough to leave it
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea
[Verse 2]
I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight
I see all the ones I went for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
'Cause I was not supposed to be here
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea
[Chorus]
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen
[Verse 3]
I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm dumb
When it gets so late I forget everyone
I need somewhere to stay
I don't think anybody I know is awake
Calm down, it's alright
Keep my arms the rest of the night
When they ask, what do I see?
I say a bright, white, beautiful heaven hanging over me
[Bridge]
Ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen
And if you want (Dead seriously)
To see me cry (
Don't swallow the cap
)
Play "Let It Be"
(
Pat yourself on the back
)
Or
"Nevermind"
(
Dead seriously
)
[Verse 4]
Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about
What I wanna say to the girls at the door?
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me
Calm down, it's alright
Leave my arms the rest of the night
When they ask, what do I see?
I say a bright, white, beautiful heaven hanging over me
[Bridge]
Ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
I'm not alone (Dead seriously)
I'll never be (Don't swallow the cap)
And to the bone (Pat yourself on the back)
I'm evergreen (Dead seriously)
And if you want (Dead seriously)
To see me cry (Don't swallow the cap)
Play "Let It Be" (Pat yourself on the back)
Or "Nevermind" (Dead seriously)
