[Verse 1]
Someone send a runner through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner for the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling that I lost today
Someone send a runner for the feeling that I lost today
[Pre-Chorus]
You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane
I don't even think to make, I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections
[Chorus]
Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me
[Verse 2]
Put an ocean and a river between everybody else
Between everything, yourself and home
Put an ocean and a river between everything, yourself and home
[Pre-Chorus]
You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane
I don't even think to make, I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections
[Chorus]
Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singin' airheads sing for me
[Outro]
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain
