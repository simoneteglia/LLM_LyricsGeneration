[Verse]
Exile
It takes your mind again
Exile
It takes your mind again
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got sucker's luck
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?
[Verse]
Exile
It takes your mind again
Exile
It takes your mind again
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you meant so much
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?
Does it feel like a trial?
Now you're thinking too fast; you're like marbles on glass
[Chorus]
Vilify
Don't even try
Vilify
Don't even try
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got sucker's luck
Have you given up?
Does it feel like a trial?
Does it trouble your mind the way you trouble mine?
Does it feel like a trial?
Did you fall for the same empty answers again?
[Chorus]
Vilify
Don't even try
Vilify
Don't even try
Vilify
Don't even try
Vilify
