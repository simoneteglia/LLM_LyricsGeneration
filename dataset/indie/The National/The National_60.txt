[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
Your imagination
Is in an awful place
Don't believe in manifestation
Your heart'll break
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers]
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
You feel it in your nerves
It's chokin' out the sun
You try in vain to be persuaded
That it's nothin'
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers]
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend
[Bridge: Matt Berninger]
You inherited a fortune
From your mother's side
Your sister didn't get it at all
She survived
[Verse 3: Matt Berninger]
Tranquilize the oceans
Between the poles
You're crawling under rocks
And climbing into holes
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers]
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend
[Post-Chorus: Both,
Matt Berninger
]
Your mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friend
Your mind is not your friend (
Your friend
)
Your mind is not your friend
[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Phoebe Bridgers]
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend again
It takes you by the hand
And leaves you nowhere
You are like a child
You're gonna flip your lid again
Don't you understand?
Your mind is not your friend
