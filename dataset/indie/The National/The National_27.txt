[Verse 1]
It's so easy to set off
The molecules and the caplets
They all have something against me
Nothing I do makes me feel different
[Pre-Chorus 1]
This one's like your sister's best friends
In a bath callin' you to join them
Can't avoid them
This one's like your mother's arms
When she was young and sunburned in the '80s
It lasts forever
[Verse 2]
The more level they have me
The more I cannot stand me
I have helpless friendships
And bad taste in liquids
[Pre-Chorus 2]
This one's like the wilderness
Without the world, I'm gonna miss those long nights
With the windows open
I keep re-readin' the same lines
Always up at 5am every mornin'
Like a baby
[Chorus]
It's just the lights comin' on
It's just the lights comin' on
[Bridge]
I have no possessions
No point of view or vision
I'm just tryin' to stay in touch with
Anything I'm still in touch with
[Pre-Chorus 3]
The sky is getting white
I can't find a lighter anywhere, I'm goin' crazy
But I'm not crazy
Put your heels against the wall
I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you
I'll still destroy you
[Chorus]
It's just the lights comin' on
It's just the lights comin' on
[Instrumental Outro]
