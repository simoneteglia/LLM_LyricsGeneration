[Verse 1]
Leave your home
Change your name
Live alone
Eat your cake
[Chorus]
Vanderlyle
crybaby cry
Oh, the water's a-risin', and still no surprisin' you
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
Man, it's all been forgiven, and swans are a-swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks
[Refrain]
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
[Chorus]
Vanderlyle
crybaby cry
Oh, the water's a-risin', and still no surprisin' you
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks
[Verse 2]
Hangin' from
Chandeliers
Same small world
At your heels
[Refrain]
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
All the very best of us string ourselves up for love
[Chorus]
Vanderlyle
crybaby cry
Oh, the water's a-risin', still no surprisin' you
Vanderlyle crybaby cry
Man, it's all been forgiven, swans are a-swimmin'
I'll explain everything to the geeks
I'll explain everything to the geeks
[Outro]
I'll explain everything to the geeks
