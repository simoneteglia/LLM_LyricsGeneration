[Verse 1]
Stay out super late tonight
Picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade
And take it with us
[Chorus]
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire
[Verse 2]
Tiptoe through our shiny city
With our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice
Bluebirds on our shoulders
[Chorus]
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
Turn the light out, say goodnight
No thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
[Chorus]
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire
[Instrumental Outro]
