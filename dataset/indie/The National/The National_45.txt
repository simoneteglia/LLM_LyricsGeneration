[Verse 1]
I can see the glowing lights
I can see them every night
Really not that far away
I could be there in a day
I wonder if you live there still
I kinda think you always will
If I tried, you'd probably be
Hard to find
[Verse 2]
What I feel now about you then
I'm just glad I can't explain
You were beautiful and close and young
In those ways, we were the same
There's a lot I've not forgotten
But I let go of other things
If I tried, they'd probably be
Hard to find
[Chorus]
They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air
[Verse 3]
I don't know why we had to lose
The ones who took so little space
We're still waiting for the ease
To cover what we can't erase
I'm not holding out for you
But I'm still watching for the signs
If I tried, you'd probably be
Hard to find
[Chorus]
You can all
Just kiss off into the air
You can all
Just kiss off into the air
