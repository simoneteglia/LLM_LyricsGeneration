[Verse 1]
Try not to worry there's a voiceover
Go on, go quiet for a change
We can dial down the daylight a little
I think the candy blue sky's messing with our brains
[Pre-Chorus]
We must have hit our heads
Don't expect familiar feelings
No one knows what to talk about
Just come lay down here on the couch
[Chorus]
Drop down out of the clouds you're in
Drop down like an alien
I'll go outside, cry, and come right back in
Drop down like an alien
[Verse 2]
I'll find you something fun to wear
That goes along with all your feelings
We'll go extremely vivid
Buttoned up and unrevealing
I can be your nurse or something
Bring you watermelon nicotine
I can hold a swimmer here
To the shore by a string
[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up, we don't have time
Avalanches in my mind
I'm getting buried in this dream
It's just as soapy as it seems
[Chorus]
Drop down out of the clouds you're in
Drop down like an alien
I'll go outside, cry, and come right back in
Drop down like an alien
[Bridge]
There's this one old idea I'm having
Stuck in a car wash somewhere and you can't stop laughing
Off the rails and no one's coming to get us
I think I like it here, so I'm gonna let 'em forget us
[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up, we don't have time
Avalanches in my mind
I'm getting buried in this dream
It's just as soapy as it seems
[Chorus]
Drop down out of the clouds you're in
Drop down like an alien
I'll go outside, cry, and come right back in
Drop down like an alien
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Drop down out of the clouds you're in
Drop down like an alien
I'll go outside, cry, and come right back in
Drop down like an alien
