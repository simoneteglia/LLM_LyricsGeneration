[Verse 1]
There's no savin' anything
Now we're swallowing the shine of the summer
There's no savin' anything
How we swallow the sun
[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over
[Chorus]
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over
[Chorus]
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' forever
[Verse 2]
I'll go bravin' everything
With you swallowin' the shine of the summer
I'll go bravin' everything
Through the shine of the sun
[Pre-Chorus]
But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over
[Chorus]
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed, when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight
What makes you think I'm enjoyin' bein' led to the flood?
We got another thing comin' undone
We got another thing comin' undone
And it's takin' us over
[Outro]
And it's takin' forever
