[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson,
Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar
]
All those eyes on me
As I sink into the open sea
Colour in my sheltered mind
Fill the gap between you and I
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
We are the sleepers, we bite our tongues
We set the fire and we let it burn
Through the dreamers, we hear the humm
They say, "Come on, come on, let's go"
So come on, come on, let's go
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
It's warm, the skin I'm living in
It creates and shapes what is within
So please look away, don't look at me
As we sink into the open sea
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
We are the sleepers, we bite our tongues
We set the fire and we let it burn
Through the dreamers, we hear the humm
They say, "Come on, come on, let's go"
We are the sleepers, we bite our tongues
We set the fire and we let it burn
Through the dreamers, we hear the humm
They say, "Come on, come on, let's go"
So come on, come on, let's go
[Outro: Nanna]
I know that it's a waste of time, chasing in the dark
But keep me in your clouded mind until time ignites a spark
I know that it's a waste of time, chasing in the dark
But keep me in your clouded mind until time ignites a spark
I know that it's a waste of time, chasing in the dark
But keep me in your clouded mind until time ignites a spark
