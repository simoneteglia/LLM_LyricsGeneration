[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson,
Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir
,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
Oh, I miss the comfort of this house
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are
The floor under our feet whispers out
"Come on in, come on in where it all begins"
[Chorus: Nanna]
Can you chase this fire away?
Can you chase this fire away?
[Verse 2: Ragnar,
Ragnar & Nanna
]
We climbed up to the top in worn out shoes
But she ran down, she ran down
She ran down to the house
A fox that gains our trust
But then breaks it as he walks
so away from us, away from us
[Chorus: Nanna]
Can you chasе the fire away?
Can you chase thе fire away?
[Post-Chorus: Nanna]
In the fall, we sleep all day
In the fall, we sleep all day
[Refrain: Nanna,
Ragnar
]
Where we are, where we are
We sleep all day
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
We sleep all day
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
We sleep all day
Where we are, where we are
[Chorus: Nanna]
Can you chase the fire away?
Can you chase the fire away?
[Post-Chorus: Nanna]
In the fall, we sleep all day
In the fall, we sleep all day
[Outro: Ragnar]
La-la la-la la-la la la

La-la la-la la-la la la
