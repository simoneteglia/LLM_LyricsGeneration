[Intro]
Taking over this town, they should worry
But these problems aside, I think I taught you well
That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run
[Verse 1]
And in the winter night sky, ships are sailing
Looking down on these bright blue city lights
And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait
We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay
[Chorus]
Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
[Post-Chorus]
And in the sea that's painted black
Crеatures lurk below the dеck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
[Verse 2]
His crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
Past the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same
[Chorus]
Howling ghosts, they reappear
In mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
[Post-Chorus]
And as the world comes to an end
I'll be here to hold your hand
'Cause you're my king and I'm your lionheart
[Outro]
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
