[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson,
Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar
]
I need nothing to travel the sea
I need nothing, I need nothing
But there's something eating at me
Black water take over
[Chorus: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea,
oh, oh-oh, oh
Darker days are raining over me,
oh, oh-oh, oh
In the deepest depths I lost myself,
oh, oh-oh, oh
I see myself through someone else
[Verse 2: Ragnar,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
The strange silence surrounding me
Grows closer,
feels
colder
But I'm ready to suffer the sea
Black water take over
[Chorus: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea,
oh, oh-oh, oh
Darker days are raining over me,
oh, oh-oh, oh
In the deepest depths I lost myself,
oh, oh-oh, oh
I see myself through someone else
[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
[Chorus: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea,
oh, oh-oh, oh
Darker days are raining over me,
oh, oh-oh, oh
In the deepest depths I lost myself,
oh, oh-oh, oh
I see myself through someone else
[Outro: Nanna]
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea, oh, oh-oh, oh
Darker days are raining over me
In the deepest depths I lost myself, oh, oh-oh, oh
I see myself through someone else
