[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the troubles
I have caused with my two hands
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Alone we traveled armed
With nothing but a shadow
We fled far away
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we
ran
[Verse 2: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we
ran
[Bridge: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Woah-oh, oh, oh-oh, we sleep until the sun goes down
Woah-oh, woah-oh, we sleep until the sun goes down
Woah-oh, woah-oh, we sleep until the sun goes down
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we
ran
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we
ran
[Outro: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
La-la-la, woah-oh, oh, oh-oh
La-la-la, we sleep until the sun goes down
La-la-la, woah-oh, woah-oh
La-la-la, we sleep until the sun goes
