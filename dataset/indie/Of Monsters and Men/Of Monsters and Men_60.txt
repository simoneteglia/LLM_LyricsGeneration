[Verse 1: Ragnar þórhallsson,
Ragnar þórhallsson and Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir
]
Jumping up and down the floor,
my head is an animal
And once there was an animal,
it had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy,
they had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
but it came back with a story to say
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 2: Ragnar þórhallsson,
Ragnar þórhallsson and Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir
]
With dirty paws and furry coat,
she ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees,
they used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war,
the sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
from dirty paws and the creatures of snow
[Refrain: Ragnar þórhallsson
Ragnar þórhallsson and Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir
]
La-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3: Ragnar þórhallsson and Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
So, for awhile, things were cold, they were scared down in thеir holes
The forest, that oncе was green, was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes - The story of the Beast with those four dirty paws
[Refrain: Ragnar þórhallsson]
La-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la
[Instrumental Outro]
