[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
It's hard letting go
I'm finally at peace, but it feels wrong
Slow I'm getting up
My hands and feet are weaker than before
[Pre-Chorus 1: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And you are folded on the bed
Where I rest my head
There's nothing I can see
Darkness becomes me
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
But I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too
[Verse 2: Nanna]
There's nothing that I'd take back
But it's hard to say there's nothing I regret
Cause when I sing, you shout
I breathe out loud
You bleed, we crawl like animals
But when it's over, I'm still awake
[Pre-Chorus 2: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
A thousand silhouettes
Dancing on my chest
No matter where I sleep
You are haunting me
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
But I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
But I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too
[Instrumental]
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cause I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cause I'm already there
I'm already there
Wherever there is you
I will be there too
