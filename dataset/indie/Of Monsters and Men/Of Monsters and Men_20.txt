[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
Undo this storm, undo this storm
Undo this storm and wait
I can't control withering wonders
Flowers that lose their shape
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
[Verse 2: Nanna]
I'll be the calm, I will be quiet
Stripped to the bone, I wait
No, I'll be a stone, I'll be the hunter
A tower that casts a shade
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
[Instrumental]
[Outro: Nanna]
I am the storm, I am the storm
I am the storm so wait
