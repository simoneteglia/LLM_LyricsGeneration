[Verse 1: Ragnar]
I know that I'm wrong
And now we're both sitting in silence
But if it's alright
I'll wrap myself around your cold shoulder
[Chorus: Ragnar & Nanna]
You think you know me, but do you really?
Something you do, something you say, oh, we don't talk about it
You think you know me, but do you really?
There's somethin' 'bout you, somethin' 'bout you
[Post-Chorus: Nanna]
Oh, we don't talk about it
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
A bull without horns
I said nothing, so how come I'm blushing?
And though you are warm
The cold lingers on the tip of your fingers
[Chorus: Ragnar & Nanna]
You think you know me, but do you really?
Something you do, something you say, oh, we don't talk about it
You think you know me, but do you really?
There's somethin' 'bout you, somethin' 'bout you
[Bridge: Nanna]
Oh,
you couldn't change this mountain
You've got me out chasing the sound, but I just hear fractions
Oh, you couldn't change this mountain
You've got me out facing the sun, but I just need direction
[Chorus: Ragnar & Nanna]
You think you know me, but do you really?
Something you do, something you say, oh, we don't talk about it
You think you know me, but do you really? (Hey)
There's somethin' 'bout you, somethin' 'bout you
[Post-Chorus: Nanna]
Oh, we don't talk about it
