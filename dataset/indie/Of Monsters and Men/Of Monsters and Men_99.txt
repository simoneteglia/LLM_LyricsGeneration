[Part I: Yellow Light]
[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir &
Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
I'm looking for a place to start
And everything feels so different now
Just grab a hold of my hand
I will lead you through this wonderland
Water up to my knees
But sharks are swimming in the sea
Just follow my yellow light
And ignore all those big warning signs
[Verse 2: Nanna &
Ragnar
]
Somewhere deep in the dark
A howling beast hears us talk
I dare you to close your eyes
And see all the colours in disguise
Running into the night
The earth is shaking and I see a light
The light is blinding my eyes
As the soft walls eat us alive
[Instrumental Outro]
[Part II: Sinking Man]
[Verse 1: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cold dark sea
Wrapping its arms around me
Pulling me down to the deep
All eyes on me
[Verse 2: Nanna & Ragnar]
I push you away
Although I wishеd you could stay
So many words left unsaid
But I'm all out of breath
[Bridge: Nanna & Ragnar]
So go, go, go, get out of hеre
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away
[Verse 3: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cold dark sea
Your waves are rocking me
I close my eyes and fall asleep
All eyes on me, your eyes on me
