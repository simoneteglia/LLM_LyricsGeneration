[Verse 1]
Oh, I miss the comfort of this house
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
The floor under our feet
Whispers out
Come on in, come on in
Where it all begins
[Chorus 1]
Can you chase
The fire away?
Can you chase
The fire away?
[Verse 2]
We climbed up to the top in worn-out shoes
But she ran down, she ran down
She ran down to the house
A fox that gains our trust
But then breaks it as he walks
Away from us
Away from us
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
Where we are, where we are
We sleep all day (Where we are, where we are)
Where we are, where we are
We sleep all day (Where we are, where we are)
Where we are, where we are
We sleep all day (Where we are, where we are)
[Chorus 1]
Can you chase
The fire away?
Can you chase
The fire away?
[Chorus 2]
In the fall
We sleep all day
In the fall
We sleep all day
[Instrumental Outro]
