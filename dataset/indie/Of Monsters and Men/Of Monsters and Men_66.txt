Nanna &
Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
Gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Don't listen to a word I say
The screams all sound the same
Though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore
[Verse 3: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
