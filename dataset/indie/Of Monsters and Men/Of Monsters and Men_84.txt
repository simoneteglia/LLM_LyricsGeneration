[Intro: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
In the spring, we made a boat out of feathers, out of bones
We set fire to our homes, walking barefoot in the snow
Distant rhythm of the drum as we drifted towards the storm
Baby lion lost his teeth, now, they're swimming in the sea
[Verse 1: Ragnar]
Troubled spirits on my chest where they laid to rest
The birds all left, my tall friend, as your body hit the sand
Million stars up in the sky formed a tiger's eye
That looked down on my face out of time and out of place
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar]
So hold on, hold on to what we are
Hold on to your heart
[Post-Chorus: Ragnar]
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Awakеned by the sound of a screaming owl
Chasing lеaves in the wind, going where we've never been
Said goodbye to you, my friend, as the fire spread
All that's left are your bones that will soon sink like stones
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So hold on, hold on to what we are
Hold on to your heart
[Post-Chorus: Ragnar]
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]
So hold on, hold on to, yur heart
