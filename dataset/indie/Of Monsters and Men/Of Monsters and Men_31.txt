[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I want to be the king of my body and mind
Gravity, let me go
Before it bruises and blackens me and you
Bury me in the glow
And I find sorrow in idle minds
And solace in being heard
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson & Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
You better run, boy, run, but be afraid
Cry, boy, cry, don't play the game
Gravity holds me down
[Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson & Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
And it's taking over (Ooh)
I call everywhere, oh, I cry out
You are my destroyer (Ooh)
I call everywhere, oh, I cry out
[Verse 2: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
A light shines through a cloud of colour fumes
Gravity, let me go
So I can feel the warmth of the sun
Bury me in the glow
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson & Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
You better run, boy, run, but be afraid
Cry, boy, cry, don't play the game
Gravity holds me down
[Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson & Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
And it's taking over (Ooh)
I call everywhere, oh, I cry out
You are my destroyer (Ooh)
I call everywhere, oh, I cry out
And it's taking over (Ooh)
I call everywhere, oh, I cry out
You are my destroyer (Ooh)
I call everywhere, oh, I cry out
