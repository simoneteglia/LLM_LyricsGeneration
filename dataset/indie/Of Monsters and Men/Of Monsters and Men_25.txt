[Verse 1]
I am up with the sunrise
I'm tired and I think I want to go home
So let's go and get started
Do you hear me calling, crying out?
Well, I run up to the house
Catch me if you think you can
[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, 'cause I know
With open arms, then I could hold it all
Oh, what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall, oh
No one's to blame, but I know
With open arms, then I could keep you close
Oh, what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall, oh
[Verse 2]
I could be centered and in place
In a field full of poppies, I could dream you all away
But I know that I've got to get running
Do you hear that roaring, pulsing sound?
But I run up to the house
You can follow if you dare
[Chorus]
Oh, what a shame, 'cause I know
With open arms, then I could hold it all
Oh, what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall, oh
No one's to blame that I knew it
With open arms, then I could keep you close
Oh, what a shame that I row
To the edges so that I can fall off
[Outro]
But I'm not, but I'm not ready for this
But I'm not, no, I'm not ready for this
Do you want it? Do you want it to be true?
But I'm not
No, I'm not ready for this
Oh, what a shame, do you need it? Do you need it to be true?
But I'm not
No, I'm not ready for this
Oh, what a shame, do you want it? Do you want it to be true?
But I'm not
No, I'm not ready for this
Oh, what a shame, do you need it? Do you need me to tell the truth?
But I'm not, no, I'm not ready for this
