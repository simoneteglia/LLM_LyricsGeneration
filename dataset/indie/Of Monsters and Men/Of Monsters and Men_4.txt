[Verse 1]
Well, maybe I'm a crook for stealing your heart away
Yeah, maybe I'm a crook for not caring for it
Yeah, maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad person
Well, baby, I know
[Verse 2]
And these fingertips will never run through your skin
And those bright blue eyes can only meet mine across a room
Filled with people that are less important than you
[Chorus]
All 'cause you love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love you
[Verse 3]
So I think it's best, we both forget before we dwell on it
The way you held me so tight
All through the night, till it was near morning
[Chorus]
'Cause you love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love you
All 'cause you love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love
You love, love, love when you know I can't love you
