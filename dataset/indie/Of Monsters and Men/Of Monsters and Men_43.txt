[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I been crawling around in mud
Chasing rivers and rubbing salt in the wound
Salt in the wound
Now I'm letting go of letting go
I feel the air light up when I'm alone
When
I'm under a dome
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
It's the only way I know
It's cake to not feel great when you're in a storm
[Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson & Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
This happiness is hell on earth
Somebody better save me
This happiness is hell on earth (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
This happiness is hell on earth
I think it's gonna kill me
This happiness is hell on earth (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
[Verse 2: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Sometimes I feel like I live on the moon
No need to sleep when the sun is staring me down
Staring me down
We fight again, we're like paper planes
But I just wanna tumble and collide
A bird in the night
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
It's the only way I know
It's cake to not feel great when you're in a storm
[Chorus: Ragnar Þórhallsson & Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
This happiness is hell on earth
Somebody better save me
This happiness is hell on earth (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
This happiness is hell on earth
I think it's gonna kill me
This happiness is hell on earth (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Outro: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Ragnar Þórhallsson]
This happiness is hell on earth
Somebody better save me
This happiness is hell on earth
This happiness is hell on earth
I think it's gonna kill me
This happiness is hell on earth
