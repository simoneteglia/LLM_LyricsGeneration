[Verse 1: Ragnar]
How does it feel
To lie alone in your bed
When you know this is forever?
Low like the sun
Come down and break into two
And I know we'll burn together
[Chorus: Ragnar]
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
But I'm careless and I'm wicked
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
It's a cruel war
I still have pieces of you stuck on me
Pieces of you stuck on me
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
It's a cruel war
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Cold, but you glow
Like the streets of Tokyo
It's alright, we can stay lost here forever
Sinking stones, we don't know
What lies on the riverbed
So we fall, no control
No, this can't be over yet
[Chorus: Ragnar]
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
But I'm careless and I'm wicked
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
It's a cruel war
I still have pieces of you stuck on me
Pieces of you stuck on me
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
It's a cruel war
[Post-Chorus: Nanna]
(That's how it's supposed to be)
[Bridge: Ragnar,
Nanna
]
We try to laugh about it like it's okay
(
That's how it's supposed to be
)
We try to laugh about it like it's okay
It's heavy, is that how it's supposed to be?
[Chorus: Ragnar,
Nanna
]
Yeah, I love you on the weekends (
Love you on the weekends
)
But I'm careless and I'm wicked (
Careless and I'm wicked)
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
It's a cruel war
I still have pieces of you stuck on me (
Love you on the weekends
)
Pieces of you stuck on me (
Careless and I'm wicked
)
Yeah, I love you on the weekends
It's a cruel war
