[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
Stop, you're cold against the skin
Take me in your arms when walls are closing in, ooh, ooh-ooh
And I run, I run, I run, awakening my heart
But you overwhelm my lungs and it's tearing me apart
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
You and I will not be shaken by the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating in the winter sound
[Post-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh, woah
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
[Verse 2: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
Stop, I will take control
Bend the metal into shapes that I know, ooh, ooh-ooh
And I run, I run, I run further than before
I shake away the skin to saturate my soul
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
You and I will not be shaken by the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating in the winter sound
You and I will not be shaken by the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating in the winter sound
[Bridge: Nanna & Ragnar]
And you scream, you scratch, you bite, you prey on my heart
And I know that you and I can never be apart
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh, woah
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh, woah
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
You and I will not be shaken by the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating in the winter
You and I will not be shaken by the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating in the winter sound
