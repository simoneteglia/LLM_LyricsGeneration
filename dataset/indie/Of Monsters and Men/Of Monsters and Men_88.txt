[Verse 1: Band]
Slow, slow me down
Her blood on my bones
Let go, lay to rest
We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall to the ground
[Verse 2: Ragnar Þórhallsson,
Band
]
Sleep, sleep all night
While the young, they wait alone
So get up, shake the rust
We crawl, we crawl, we crawl, we crawl on the ground
[Chorus: Band]
Alone, I fight these animals
Alone, until I get home
[Verse 3: Ragnar,
Band
]
A wolf, wolf and I
We share the same cold meal
I float on
, float on down
We ride, we ride, we ride, we ride it all out
[Post-Chorus: Band]
We ridе, we ride, we ridе, we ride it all
Ride, we ride, we ride, we ride it all
Ride, we ride, we ride, we ride it all out
[Chorus: Ragnar]
Alone, I fight these animals
Alone, until I get home
Alone, I fight these animals
Alone, until I get home
Alone, I fight these animals
Alone, until I get home
Alone, I fight these animals
Alone until I get home
[Bridge:
Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir
, Nanna & Ragnar]
Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]
Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
