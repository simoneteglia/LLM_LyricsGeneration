[Verse 1: Ragnar]
Under a dome
While we wait for it
We feel all of it
Wait
Looking back on it
[Chorus: Ragnar,
Nanna
]
Under a dome
Where I met you first (
Met you
)
Fuck the way we were (
Way we
)
Wait
Watch the colour burst (
Colour
)
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2: Ragnar,
Nanna
]
Under a dome,
under a dome
(
Ooh
)
In a foreign place
Heard you call my name
Stay
Watch the tide roll in
[Chorus: Nanna,
Both
]
Under a dome (Under a dome)
Where I met you first
Fuck the way we were
Wait
Watch the colour burst
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro: Ragnar]
I'm taking over my own throne
I’m holding my heart and it's overgrown
I'm kicking out and I’m full of life
So why should I cry over northern lights?
And it's over now and I'm falling
And I'm falling
And I'm falling
And I'm falling
And I'm falling
So fuck all the times that I've fallen
And I’m falling
Creature, you’re part of this loving game
But it's over now and I’m falling
And I'm falling
And I'm falling
