[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I found a fire in your shadow
I know you are born to be wild
In your years you've been alone too
Hidin' from the monsters in your head
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Sugar in a bowl
On your coffee table
Animals that sleep on your dining room floor
In your house
You are just waiting for a light to pass by
One second at a time
[Verse 2: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Your freckles are gone and now your face is
Dry as the walls surrounding you
Coffee keeps you up for hours
TV tucks you in at night
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
A picture on the wall
Of a friend you used to know
The smell of the coffee sitting on the stove
In your house
You are just waiting for a light to pass by
One second at a time
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Chorus: Choir]
Sugar in a bowl on your coffee table
Animals that sleep on your dining room floor
In your house
You are still waiting for a light to pass by
One second at a time
