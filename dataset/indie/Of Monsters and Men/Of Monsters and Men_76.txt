[Intro: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
We came here on his back and we caught your eye
The salty ocean wind made the seagulls cry
The rocking of his house had me holding on
But I knew that I was safe from there on out
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse: Nanna]
And the waves, that hit his face, marked the past
And the the furrows on his skin, oh, how time goes fast
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And we are far from home but we're so happy
Far from home, all alone but we're so happy
[Post-Chorus: Ragnar]
La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la
La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Bridge: Nanna]
After every sunny day came a stormy night
That's when Finnеr would say, "Keep your heads held high"
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
And we arе far from home but we're so happy
Far from home, all alone but we're so happy
[Post-Chorus: Ragnar]
La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la
La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la
[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
And we are far from home, but we're so happy
Far from home, all alone, but we're so happy
