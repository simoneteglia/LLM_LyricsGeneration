[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
The lights go out, I am all alone
All the trees outside are buried in the snow
I spend my night, dancing with my own shadow
And it holds me and it never lets me go
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I move slow and steady, but I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady past the ones that I used to know
[Verse 2: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
My dear old friend, take me for a spin
Two wolves in the dark, running in the wind
I'm letting go, but I've never felt better
Passing by, all the monsters in my head
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And I move slow and steady, but I feel likе a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and stеady past the ones that I used to know
[Post-Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And I'm never ready 'cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me show what I want to show
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And I move slow and steady, but I feel like a waterfall
Yeah, I move slow and steady past the ones that I used to know
[Post-Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And I'm never ready 'cause I know, I know, I know
That time won't let me show what I want to show
[Outro: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
