[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Feel the ocean as it breathes, shivering teeth
See the mountains where they meet smothering me
As the wind fends off the waves, I count down the days
Heavy stones fear no weather
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
I find comfort in the sound and the shape of the heart
How it echoes through the chest from under the ground
As the hills turn into holes, I fill them with gold
Heavy stones fear no weather
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar]
And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you
An empire for two
[Verse 3: Ragnar]
And I paint your body black, I hide in your hair
And you're staring back at me like I wasn't there
As our bodies become stills, we welcome the fear
Heavy stones fear no weather
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you
An empire for two
[Instrumental]
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
And from the rain
Comes a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
Illuminate
There's a river running wild that will create
An empire for you
An empire for two
An empire for you
An empire for two
