[Intro]
Cold dark sea, wrapping its arms around me
Pulling me down to the deep, all eyes on me
[Verse]
I push you away, although I wish you would stay
So many words left unsaid but I'm all out of breath
[Chorus]
So, go, go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away
[Outro]
Cold dark sea, your waves are rocking me
Pulling me down to the deep
All eyes on me, your eyes on me
