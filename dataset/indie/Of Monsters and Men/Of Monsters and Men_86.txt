[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
Fishing for a friend
Can't remember when it was dark or the sun coming up
Far across the ocean alone while numb bears at home
Said I could never get there, never get there
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 2: Nanna]
Breaking little twigs with my feet
And underneath, is a road that's so steep
Far across the ocean alone while numb bears at home
Said I could never get there but I'm already there
[Refrain: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Already there, already there
Already there, already there
Already there, already there
Already there, already there
We are already
La, la-la-la la la la la, la la, la
La, la-la-la la la la
La, la-la-la la la la la, la la, la
La, la-la-la la la la
[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]
Already there, already there
Already there, already there
We are already
