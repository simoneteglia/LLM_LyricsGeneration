[Verse 1]
Cool it down
The mind is a riddle
You cannot solve
Cool it down
The body's a landscape of wildflower
[Chorus]
Stay here, stay here
Stay here, I want you
And I know this can't be wasted love
(Stay here, I want you)
Stay here, stay here
Stay here, I need you
Please don't tell me that it's wasted love
(Stay here, I need you)
[Verse 2]
Sleep, I know
You haven't been dreaming
You overflow
And I still feel you around
You've become a tempo that my heart knows
[Chorus]
Stay here, stay here
Stay here, I want you
And I know this can't be wasted love
(Stay here, I want you)
Stay here, stay here
Stay here, I need you
Please don't tell me that it's wasted love
(Stay here, I need you)
[Bridge]
Will you see me, love?
Who am I in your temple? Ah-ah-ah
Will you see me, love?
Who am I in your temple?
[Outro]
Stay here, stay here
Will you see me, love?
Who am I in your temple?
(Stay here, I want you)
Stay here, stay here
Will you see me, love?
Who am I in your temple?
(Stay here, I need you)
