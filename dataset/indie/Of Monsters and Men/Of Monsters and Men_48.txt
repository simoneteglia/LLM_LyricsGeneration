[Verse 1]
Lost my name
Love left dry
Frost or flames
Skeleton, me
[Chorus]
Fall asleep
Spin the sky
Skeleton, me
Love don't cry
[Verse 2]
Soon comes rain
Dry your eyes
Frost or flames
Skeleton, me
[Chorus]
Fall asleep
Spin the sky
Skeleton, me
Love don't cry
[Outro]
Love don't cry
Love don't cry
Love don't cry
Skeleton, me
Love don't cry
Love don't cry
Love don't cry
Skeleton, me
