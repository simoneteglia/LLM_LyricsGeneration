[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
What are they talking about on the weekend?
Lost in the forest of this heart is a foreign still
Why are they shaking their heads? We're stuck in slow life
Is it the beating of the chest that makes us fear the rest?
[Verse 2: Nanna]
We're slowly sailing away behind closed eyes
Where not a single ray of light can puncture through the night
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
You caught me in the tide and I caught you
Sheltered by the night,
red in tooth and red in claw
You caught me in the tide and I caught you
Sheltered by the night,
red in tooth and red in claw
[Verse 3: Nanna]
Between the daylight and the deep sea
Lies a swarm of silhouettes floating aimlessly
But I'm a mountain, I am a killer
You'll get lost and buried deep if you swim with me
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
You caught me in the tide and I caught you
Sheltered by the night,
red in tooth and red in claw
You caught me in the tide and I caught you
Sheltered by the night,
red in tooth and red in claw
[Instrumental]
[Bridge: Nanna & Ragnar]
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
So look at you, look at me (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
All because we need to know (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
So look at me, look at you (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
All because we'll never know (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
So look at you, look at me (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
All because we need to know (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
So look at me, look at you (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
All because we'll never know (
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
)
[Outro]
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh

Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, oh
