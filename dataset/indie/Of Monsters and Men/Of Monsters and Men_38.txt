[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
I live a life of love
Hold me down, hold me down
I live a life of letting go (Ooh)
Under a starlit night
I wrap myself in thin sheet of ice
Out there, the stars are crystallised
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard in the dark
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard
[Chorus: Nanna]
'Cause you colour me clear
Now what are you, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, you colour me clear
Now what are you waiting for?
[Verse 2: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
See how my mountains turn
From blue to black, from white to gray
I'm a bird, and a broken one (Ooh)
The drops illuminate
And evaporate into a
neon lake
I'm a beast, and a vicious one
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard in the dark
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard
Ooh, ooh-ooh, find me in the backyard
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
'Cause you colour me clear
Now what are you, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, you colour me clear
Now what are you waiting for?
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
'Cause you colour me clear
Now what are you, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, you colour me clear
Now what are you waiting for?
