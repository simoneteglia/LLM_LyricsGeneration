[Chorus]
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath
In this storm
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath
In this storm, I feel it
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath
To this storm
