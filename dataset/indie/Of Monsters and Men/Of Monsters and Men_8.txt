[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
If I could face them, if I could make amends
With all my shadows
I'd bow my head and welcome them
But I feel it burning, like when the winter wind stops my breathing
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone?
I fear you won't, I fear you don't
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And it echoes when I breathe
Until all you see is my ghost
Empty vessel, crooked teeth
Wish you could see
[Chorus: Nanna]
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath in this storm
[Verse 2: Nanna]
I am a stranger, I am an alien
Inside a structure
Are you really gonna love me when I'm gone
With all my thoughts and all my faults?
I feel it biting, I feel it break my skin
So uninviting
Are you really gonna need me when I'm gone?
I fear you won't, I fear you don't
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
And it echoes when I breathe
Until all you see is my ghost
Empty vessel, crooked teeth
Wish you could see
[Chorus: Nanna]
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me under
And I wither underneath, in this storm, I feel it
[Outro: Nanna]
And they call me under
And I'm shaking like a leaf
And they call me underneath
To this storm
