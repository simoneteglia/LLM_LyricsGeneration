[Verse 1]
I been crawling around in mud
Chasing rivers and rubbing salt in the wound
Salt in the wound
Now I'm letting go of letting go
I feel the air light up when I'm alone
When I'm under a dome
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the only way I know
It's cake to not feel great when you're in a storm
[Chorus]
This happiness is hell on earth
Somebody better save me
This happiness is hell on earth
This happiness is hell on earth
This thing is gonna kill me
This happiness is hell on earth
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I live on the moon
No need to sleep when the sun is staring me down
Staring mе down
We fight again, we're likе paper planes
But I just wanna tumble and collide
A bird in the night
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the only way I know
It's cake to not feel great when you're in a storm
[Chorus]
This happiness is hell on earth
Somebody better save me
This happiness is hell on earth
This happiness is hell on earth
This thing is gonna kill me
This happiness is hell on earth
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I fall, I fall too deep
But I guess it's time to say that I'm ok
That I'm ok
[Chorus]
This happiness is hell on earth
Somebody better save me
This happiness is hell on earth
This happiness is hell on earth
This thing is gonna kill me
This happiness is hell on earth
