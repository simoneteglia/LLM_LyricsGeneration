[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir &
Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
I'm looking for a place to start but everything feels so different now
Just grab a hold of my hand, I will lead you through this wonderland
Water up to my knees, but sharks are swimming in the sea
Just follow my yellow light and ignore all those big warning signs
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 2: Nanna,
Ragnar
,
Both
]
Somewhere deep in the dark, a howling ghost hears us talk
I dare you to close your eyes and see all the colours in disguise
Running into the night, the earth is shaking and I see a light
The light is blinding my eyes as the soft walls
eat us alive
[Instrumental Outro]
