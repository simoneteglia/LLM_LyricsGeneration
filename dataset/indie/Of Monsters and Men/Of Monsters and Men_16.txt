[Intro: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, and
Nanna Bryndís Hilmarstoddir & Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
You are right, I'll move on, but my lungs feel so small
I couldn't breathe if I tried
I lay my head on the floor
My beating heart wanted more, but I'll keep it in and keep you out
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
[Verse 1: Nanna]
And for the longest time I knew, there was nothing left for us to do
But I tried, oh, I try
And in this quiet company, there is nothing staring back at me
I'm in need of a sound
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
Voices disappear when you're speaking in somber tunes
I will be the wolf and when you're starving, you'll need it too
Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
It isn't you, it isn't
[Verse 2: Nanna]
I grew tall to fill the void
Let me go, 'cause you are just a shade of what I am, not what I'll be
But in this quiet company, I forget sometimes just how to breathe
Fill my lungs with a sound
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
Voices disappear when you are speaking in somber tunes
I will be the wolf and when you're starving, you'll need it too
Hungry for the kill, but this hunger, it isn't you
It isn't you, it isn't
[Instrumental]
[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
I'm drowning, and I'm drowning
