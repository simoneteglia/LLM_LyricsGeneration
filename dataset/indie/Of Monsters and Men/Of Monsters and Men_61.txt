[Intro]
Jumping up and down the floor, my head is an animal
And once there was an animal, it had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy, they had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away, but it came back with a story to say
[Verse 1]
Her dirty paws and furry coat, she ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees, they used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war, the sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below from dirty paws and the creatures of snow
[Refrain]
La-la-la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la
La-la-la, la
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
So for a while, things were cold, they were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green was coloured black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes: The story of the beast with those four dirty paws
[Refrain]
La-la-la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la
La-la-la, la
[Refrain]
La-la-la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la
La-la-la, la
