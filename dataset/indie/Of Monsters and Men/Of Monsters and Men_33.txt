[Verse 1: Ragnar]
I start a war, no time to think about it
It might blow over soon
I start a war, no way to get around it
It might blow over soon
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar & Nanna]
You make me feel like a ghost
Walking around, and talking in my sleep
Talking in my
[Chorus: Nanna]
Sleepwalking, the nights are cold, the lights are are out
I still dream in indigo when you're around (Ah, ah)
Sleepwalking, the nights are cold, the lights are out
I still dream in indigo when you're around (Ah, ah)
[Post-Chorus: Nanna]
(Ah, ah)
(Ah, ah)
I'm still dreaming indigo when you're around (Ah, ah)
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Three paper moons
I know the colour's fading
It might get colder soon
This neighborhood
Feels like it's always changing
It might get colder soon
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar]
You make me feel like a ghost
Walking around, talking in my sleep
You make me feel like I'm lost
Up in the clouds, talking in my sleep
I'm talking in my
[Chorus: Nanna]
Sleepwalking, the nights are cold, the lights are are out
I still dream in indigo when you're around (Ah, ah)
Sleepwalking, the nights are cold, the lights are out
I still dream in indigo when you're around (Ah, ah)
[Outro: Ragnar,
Nanna
]
I start a war (
Ah, ah
)
No time to think about it (
Ah, ah
)
I still dream in indigo when lights are out
(
Ah, ah
)
I start a war (
Ah, ah
)
No time to think about it (
Ah, ah
)
I still dream in indigo when lights are out
(
Ah, ah
)
