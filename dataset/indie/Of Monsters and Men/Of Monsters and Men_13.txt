[Intro: Nanna]
Wild roses on a bed of leaves
In the month of May
I think I wrote my own pain
Oh, don't you?
[Verse 1: Nanna]
Down by the creek, I couldn't sleep
So I followed a feelin'
Sounds like the vines, they are breathing
(Oh, it sounds like, it sounds like, it sounds like, it sounds, oh)
And I've seen the way the seasons change
When I just give it time
But I feel out of my mind all the time
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna]
In the night, I am wild-eyed
And you got me now
[Chorus: Nanna]
Oh, roses, they don't mean a thing, you don't understand
But why don't we full on pretend?
Oh, won't you?
Before I closed my eyes, I saw a moth in the sky
And I wish I could fly that high
Oh, don't you?
[Verse 2: Nanna & Ragnar]
A serpent on a bed of leaves
In the month of May
What do you want me to say?
(Oh it sounds like, it sounds like, it sounds like, it sounds, oh)
You keep me still when all I feel
Is an aimless direction
When I think I'm losin' connection
I see you
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
In the night, I am wild-eyed
And you got me now
Dim the lights, we are wild-eyed
And you got me now
[Chorus: Nanna]
Oh, roses, they don't mean a thing, you don't understand
But why don't we full on pretend?
Oh, won't you?
Before I closed my eyes, I saw a moth in the sky
And I wish I could fly that high
Oh, don't you?
[Post-Chorus: Nanna]
Oh, don't you?
Oh, don't you?
[Bridge: Nanna]
In the night, we are wild-eyed
And you got me now
Dim the lights, we are wild-eyed
And you got me now
[Outro]
In the night, I am wild-eyed
And you got me now
