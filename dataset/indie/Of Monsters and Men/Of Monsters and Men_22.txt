[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
Let's not make this
Complicated, I know you
Last night I had the
Strangest dream that you knew me too
[Chorus: Nanna]
But you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents' house
I've become a visitor
[Verse 2: Nanna]
In the night, you say
That you go underwater
You won't take me, no
You won't drown with your lover
[Bridge: Nanna]
You told me that I wasn't available
I guess I wasn't, I wasn't capable
I want to do better this time
But I guess you're better in the back of my mind
[Chorus: Nanna and Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Oh, you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents' house
I've bеcome a visitor
[Outro: Nanna and Ragnar,

My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bеd
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
(
Hey, stop, you're doing this again
)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
(
Hey, stop, you're doing this again
)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
(
Hey, stop, you're doing this again
)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed (
Whoa-oh
)
(
Hey, stop, you're doing this again
)
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed (
Whoa-oh
)
