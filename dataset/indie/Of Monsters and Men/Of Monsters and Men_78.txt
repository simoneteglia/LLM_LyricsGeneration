[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I have caused with my two hands
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar]
Alone we traveled armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Ragnar
]
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing likе the rest
[Chorus: Nanna,
Ragnar
]
Hold your horses now,
wе sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
[Post-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Ho-oh, oh, oh-oh
We sleep until the sun goes down
Ho-oh, ho-oh
We sleep until the sun goes down
[Bridge: Nanna & Ragnar]
Woah-oh, woah-oh
We sleep until the sun goes down
[Chorus: Nanna,
Ragnar
]
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
deep into the mountain sound
Hold your horses now,
we sleep until the sun goes down
Through the woods, we ran
[Post-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
La-la-la
Ho-oh, oh, oh-oh
La-la-la
We sleep until the sun goes down
La-la-la
Ho-oh, woah-oh
La-la-la
We sleep until the sun goes
