[Intro: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir,
Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson
]
Taking over this town, they should worry
But these problems aside, I think I taught you well
That we won't run, and we won't run, and we won't run
[Verse 1: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
And in the winter night sky, ships are sailing
Looking down on these bright blue city lights
And they won't wait, and they won't wait, and they won't wait
We're here to stay, we're here to stay, we're here to stay
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Howling ghosts, they reappear in mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart, a lionheart
[Verse 2: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
His crown lit up the way as we movеd slowly
Past the wondering eyеs of the ones that were left behind
Though far away, though far away, though far away
We're still the same, we're still the same, we're still the same
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Howling ghosts, they reappear in mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
[Post-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
And in the sea that's painted black, creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
And as the world comes to an end, I'll be here to hold your hand
'Cause you're my king and I'm your lionheart
[Bridge: Nanna & Ragnar]
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Howling ghosts, they reappear in mountains that are stacked with fear
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
[Post-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
And in the sea that's painted black
Creatures lurk below the deck
But you're a king and I'm a lionheart
[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
A lionheart
