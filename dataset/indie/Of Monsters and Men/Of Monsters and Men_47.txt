[Verse 1]
Don't feel like talkin' all too much
There is a storm that is ascending now
Feels like it's close enough to touch
So I step back into it
Lonely weather
And you can stay here if you want
But is it worth it if my limbs don't follow?
[Chorus]
Lonely weather
[Verse 2]
We don't say it all too much
There's a storm that is ascending now (Lonely weather)
Feels like close enough to touch
I step back into it (Lonely weather)
We can stay here if you want
I fell back into it (Lonely weather)
I get back into it
[Instrumental Outro]
