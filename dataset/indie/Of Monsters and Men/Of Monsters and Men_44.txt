[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
All this time wasted and all this time gone
You are still waiting on me
Everytime you leave the house, remember you're not safe
But you are hardly ever
[Verse 2: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
All those times that I could swear I heard you speak
You spoke in such low voice
Of how if you could choose, you would choose not to feel
'Cause you are hardly ever happy
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
Sometimes I find myself standing in those steps
With eyes so blank and unsure
Realising this is not where I want to be
And not where I want to go
[Verse 4: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
And I don't mean to somehow always disagree
But I feel that you do not see
In order to love, you have to be all you can be
Mostly you have to love yourself
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 5: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar Þórhallsson,
Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir
]
Oh, with all this time wasted and all this time gone
You are still waiting on me
Oh, but if I could choose, I would choose not to feel
'Cause I am hardly ever happy
[Outro: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
I am hardly ever happy, mmh
Mmh
I am hardly ever happy
[Instrumental Outro]
