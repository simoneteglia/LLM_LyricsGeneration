[Verse 1: Ragnar,
Both
]
He lives in the darkness, he's calling my name
He's keeping me up, keeping me up, I'm wide awake
He feeds on my ego, he swallows my pain
So figure it out, figure it out, stay away
[Pre-Chorus: Both]
This is all I know and I can feel it grow
I'm restless, oh, I'm restless
It's hard for me to breathe when all I do is feel
So heartless, am I heartless?
[Chorus: Both,
Nanna
]
Can I keep it up?
Still got that feeling
I don't know about these heavy hands, well, maybe
They can pull me up
Still got that feeling
I don't know about these heavy hands 'cause lately
I feel like a desert island, oh-oh
[Verse 2: Nanna,
Both
]
And I had a vision of pillars of sand
It's keeping me up, keeping me up, and I bend
Break me in two so we can both dance
Figure it out, figure it out, hand in hand
[Pre-Chorus: Both]
This is all I know and I can feel it grow
I'm restless, oh, I'm restless
It's hard for me to breathe when all I do is feel
So heartless, am I heartless?
[Chorus: Both,
Nanna
]
Can I keep it up?
Still got that feeling
I don't know about these heavy hands, well, maybe
They can pull me up
Still got that feeling
I don't know about these heavy hands 'cause lately
I feel like a desert island
[Post-Chorus: Nanna,
Both
]
(Still got that feeling)
Yeah, lately I feel like a desert island
(Oh-oh)
[Chorus: Both,
Nanna
]
Still got that feeling
I don't know about these heavy hands, well, maybe
They can pull me up
Still got that feeling
I don't know about these heavy hands
'cause lately
I feel like a desert island, oh-oh
