[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
The sea said goodbye to the shore
So the sun wouldn't notice
The seaweed that wrapped its
Arms around you
[Verse 2: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
The carpet on my cheek
Feels like a forest
And I run through the tall trees
With your hand chasing me
[Verse 3: Ragnar]
The books that I keep by my bed
Are full of your stories
That I drew up from a little dream of mine
A little nightmare of yours
[Verse 4: Nanna &
Nanna & Ragnar
]
To be us, to take this plunge
To forgive and forget
And be the better man,
to be a better man
To be a better man
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So love me, mother
And love me, father
And love my sister
As well
[Verse 5: Nanna]
The cat's silhouette
As big as a monster
In this concrete jungle
With street lights hanging their heads
[Verse 6: Ragnar &
Nanna & Ragnar
]
So make all your last demands
For I will forsake you
And I'll meet your eyes
for the very first time
For the very last
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So love me, mother
And love me, father
And love my sister
As well
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So love me, mother
And love me, father
And love my brother
As well
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So love me, mother
And love me, father
And love my sister
As well
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So love me, mother
And love me, father
And love my brother
As well
[Outro: Nanna &
Nanna & Ragnar
]
I met a man today
And he smiled back at me
Now there are thoughts like these
That keep me on my feet
That keep me on my feet
