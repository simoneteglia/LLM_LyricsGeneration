[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
Lost in skies of powdered gold
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopes
As I tumble down, falling fast to the ground
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear
[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine
[Verse 2: Nanna]
Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs
Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear
[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine
[Bridge: Nanna]
But I'm okay in see-through skin
I forgive what is within
Because I'm in this house, I'm in this home
All my time
[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine
