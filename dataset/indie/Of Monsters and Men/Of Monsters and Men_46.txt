[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson,
Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir
,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
Oh, I miss the comfort of this house
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are
The floor under our feet whispers out
"Come on in, come on in where it all begins"
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 2: Ragnar,
Ragnar and Band
]
The tallest man I've ever seen afloat
On a boat, on a boat, on a boat, on a boat
He keeps his only son close by
In a bag, in a bag, in a bag on his back
[Chorus: Nanna]
Can you chase the fire away?
Can you chase the fire away?
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 3: Ragnar,
Ragnar & band
]
We climbed up to the top in worn-out shoes
But she ran down, she ran down, she ran down to the house
A fox that gains our trust, but then breaks it as he walks
Away from us, away from us
[Chorus; Nanna]
Can you chase the fire away?
Can you chase the fire away?
In the fall, we sleep all day
In the fall, we sleep all day
[Bridge: Band]
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
Where we are, where we are
[Chorus: Nanna,
Band
]
Can you chase the fire away? (
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are
)
Can you chase the fire away? (
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are
)
In the fall, we sleep all day (
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are
)
In the fall, we sleep all day  (
Where we are, where we are, where we are, where we are
)
[Outro: Band]
