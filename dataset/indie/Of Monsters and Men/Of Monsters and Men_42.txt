[Verse 1: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cold dark sea
Wrapping its arms around me
Pulling me down to the deep
All eyes on me
[Verse 2: Nanna & Ragnar]
I push you away
Although I wished you could stay
So many words left unsaid
But I'm all out of breath
[Bridge: Nanna & Ragnar]
So go, go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away, get out of here
Go, go, get out of here
Go away
[Verse 3: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cold dark sea
Your waves are rocking me
I close my eyes and fall asleep
All eyes on me, your eyes on me
