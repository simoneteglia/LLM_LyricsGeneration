[Verse 1: Ragnar]
I'm stuck in gravity
I'm far from where I wanna be
I'm like a raindrop in the ocean
I get lost in my delusional reality
I don't know up from down
Or when my feet are on the ground
I've been around for thirty years
It's kinda hard to think about your own mortality
[Chorus: Ragnar & Nanna]
And this high, high love
That you give to me
It's all I'm missing
It's all I'm missing
Yeah, this high, high love
That you give to me
It's dripping down my hands like honey
It's all I'm missing
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
I'm stuck in gravity
I'm clawing for some bravery
Try to be still in a moment
And I'm hoping for a never ending odyssey
I don't know high from low
Or when I should be letting go
It's like I'm anchored to the floor
And I need more, I need stars to light the colony
[Chorus: Ragnar & Nanna]
And this high, high love
That you give to me
It's all I'm missing
It's all I'm missing
Yeah, this high, high love
That you give to me
It's dripping down my hands like honey
It's all I'm missing
[Post: Chorus: Ragnar]
So give me something good
Just give me something good
[Outro: Ragnar,
Ragnar & Nanna

Staring out the window, looking at the rainfall
Hoping for starlight,
head is still an animal
Staring out the window, looking at the rainfall
Hoping for starlight,
head is still an animal
Staring out the window, looking at the rainfall
Hoping for starlight,
head is still an animal
Staring out the window, looking at the rainfall
Hoping for starlight,
head is still an animal
Head is still an animal
