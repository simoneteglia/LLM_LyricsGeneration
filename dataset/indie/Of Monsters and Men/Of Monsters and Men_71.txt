[Verse 1]
Let's not make this
Complicated, I know you
Last night I had the
Strangest dream that you knew me too
[Chorus]
But you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents' house
I've become a visitor
[Scatting]
[Verse 2]
In the night, you say
That you go underwater
You won't take me, no
You won't drown with your lover
[Chorus]
Oh, you need to wake up
I can't have you disappear
Just like my parents' house
I've become a visitor
[Scatting]
[Outro]
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
My mother said I was always afraid of the dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
My mother said I was always afraid of th–µ dark
But I'm not, I don't mind
Having a ghost in my bed
