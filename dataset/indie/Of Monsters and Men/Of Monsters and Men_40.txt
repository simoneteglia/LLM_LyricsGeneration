[Verse 1: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
We couldn't turn it around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I tried
You don't believe it, we do this every time
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flames 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
[Verse 2: Ragnar,
Nanna
,
Both
]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let it go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echo
(The echo)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go,
let it go
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flames 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
[Bridge: Ragnar,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what do you got to lose?
Make up your mind, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flames 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
