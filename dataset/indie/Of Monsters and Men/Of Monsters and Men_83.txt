[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
The sea said goodbye to the shore, so the sun wouldn't notice
The seaweed that wrapped its arms around you
[Verse 2: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
The carpet on my cheek feels like a forest
And I run through the tall trees with your hand chasing me
[Verse 3: Ragnar]
The books that I keep by my bed are full of your stories
That I drew up from a little dream of mine, a little nightmare of yours
[Verse 4: Nanna,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
To be us, to take this plunge, to forgive and forget
And be the better man, to be a better man, to be a better man
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So love mе, mother and love me, fathеr
And love my sister as well
[Verse 5: Nanna]
The cat's silhouette, as big as a monster
In this concrete jungle with streetlights hanging their heads
[Verse 6: Ragnar,
Nanna & Ragnar
]
So, make all your last demands for I will forsake you
And I'll meet your eyes for the very first time, for the very last
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So love me, mother and love me, father
And love my sister as well
So love me, mother and love me, father
And love my brother as well
So love me, mother and love me, father
And love my sister as well
[Outro: Nanna & Nanna & Ragnar]
I met a man today, and he smiled back at me
Now there are thoughts like these that keep me on my feet
That keep me on my feet
