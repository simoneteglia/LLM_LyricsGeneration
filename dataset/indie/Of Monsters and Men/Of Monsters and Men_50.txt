[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
I need nothing
To travel the sea
I need nothing
I need nothing
But there's something
Eating at me
Black water
Take over
[Chorus]
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea (Oh Ooh)
Darker days are raining over me (Oh Ooh)
In the deepest depths I lost myself (Oh Ooh)
I see myself through someone else
[Verse 2]
The strange silence
Surrounding me
Grows closer
Feels colder
But I'm ready
To suffer the sea
Black water
Take over
[Chorus]
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea (Oh Ooh)
Darker days are raining over me (Oh Ooh)
In the deepest depths I lost myself (Oh Ooh)
I see myself through someone else (Oh Ooh)
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea (Oh Ooh)
Darker days are raining over me (Oh Ooh)
In the deepest depths I lost myself (Oh Ooh)
I see myself through someone else (Oh Ooh)
Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea
Darker days are raining over me
In the deepest depths I lost myself
I see myself through someone else
