[Verse 1]
I'm waiting for the snow
I'm waiting for vision
So I can feel brighter
I can feel lighter
I used to make mountains
But then they grew bigger than me
I thought that I'd climb my way up high
But what if I tumble?
[Chorus]
Have I said too much?
Did I love too hard?
This steel can't carry me now that things are rough
[Verse 2]
I used to make mountains
But then they grew bigger than me
And I used to hunger
So what can you offer me?
(What can you offer me?)
What can you offer me?
When
you are all symphony
What can you offer me?
[Chorus]
Have I said too much?
Did I love too hard?
This steel can't carry me now that things are rough
Have I said too much?
Did I love too hard?
This steel can't carry me now that things are rough
(So what can you offer me?)
Now, what can you offer me?
(What can you offer?)
Now, what can you offer me?
(Wherever you are)
This steel can't carry me
(Wherever you are)
And you can't carry me, carry me
