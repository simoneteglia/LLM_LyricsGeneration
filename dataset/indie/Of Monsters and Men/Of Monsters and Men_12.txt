[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
When the words weigh heavy on the heart
I am lost and led only by the stars
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar]
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Breathe in, breathe out, let the human in (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Breathe in, breathe out and let it in (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Plants awoke and they slowly grow beneath the skin (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So breathe in, breathe out, let the human in
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
The air is silk, shadows form a grin
If I lose control, I feed the beast within
[Pre-Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
Breathe in, breathe out, let the human in (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Breathe in, breathe out and let it in (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Plants awoke, and they slowly grow beneath the skin (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So breathe in, breathe out; let the human in
[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne
If I could only let go
