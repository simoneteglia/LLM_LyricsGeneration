[Intro: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir]
We came here on his back and we caught your eye
The salty ocean wind made the seagulls cry
The rocking of his house had me holding on
But I knew that I was safe from there on out
[Verse 1: Nanna]
And the waves that hit his face marked the past
And the the furrows on his skin, oh, how time goes fast
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar Þórhallsson]
And we are far from home
But we're so happy
Far from home, all alone
But we're so happy
[Post-Chorus: band]
La, la-la, la
La-la, la, la-la, la
La, la-la, la
La-la, la, la-la, la
[Verse 2: Nanna]
After every sunny day came a stormy night
That's when Finner would say, "Keep your heads held high"
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
And we are far from home
But we're so happy
Far from home, all alone
But we're so happy
[Post-Chorus: band]
La, la-la, la
La-la, la, la-la, la
La, la-la, la
La-la, la, la-la, la
[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar & band]
And we are far from home (La, la-la, la)
But we're so happy (La-la, la, la-la, la)
Far from home, all alone (La, la-la, la)
But we're so happy (La-la, la, la-la, la)
[Outro: Band]
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
