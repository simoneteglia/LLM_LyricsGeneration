[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
In the spring, we made a boat
Out of feathers, out of bones
We set fire to our homes
Walking barefoot in the snow
Distant rhythm of the drum
As we drifted towards the storm
Baby lion lost his teeth
Now they're swimming in the sea
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Troubled spirits on my chest
Where they laid to rest
The birds all left, my tall friend
As your body hit the sand
Million stars up in the sky
Formed a tiger's eye
That looked down on my face
Out of time and out of place
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir & Ragnar]
So hold on
Hold on to
What we are
Hold on to
Your heart
[Post-Chorus: Band]
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
[Verse 3: Ragnar]
Awakened by the sound
Of a screaming owl
Chasing leaves in the wind
Going where we've never been
Said goodbye to you, my friend
As the fire spread
All that's left are your bones
That will soon sink like stones
[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar]
So hold on
Hold on to
What we are
Hold on to
Your heart
[Post-Chorus: Band]
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
[Outro: Nanna & Ragnar]
So hold on
Hold on to
Your heart
