[Verse 1]
Take my eyes and my whole heart in your hands
In your hands
And board the yacht as in departs
Lead me on the shore
But I will hunt no more
Hold my sin above my head
And take me home instead
Take me home instead
[Verse 2]
I will not speak of your sin
There is a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shocked
[Chorus]
But oh, my heart was fraud
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Consign me not to darkness
[Chorus]
But oh, my heart was fraud
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Consign me not to darkness
