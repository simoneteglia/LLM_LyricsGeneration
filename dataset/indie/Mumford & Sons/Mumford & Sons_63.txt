[Verse 1]
She was darkened but light-headed, a daydream
Earning from her eyes down to her knees
[Pre-Chorus]
With some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Some kind of love
[Chorus]
I'll be the devil in your eye if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye if it'll change the way you feel
[Verse 2]
Hold my breath, I know it's me you're gonna blame
Blame my mother, blame my mood, it's all the same
[Pre-Chorus]
Some kind of love
Tonight I can't tell if it's love or hate
How smooth they are and quick to interchange
Just some kind of love
[Chorus]
I'll be the devil in your eye if it's what you need to hear
I'll be the devil in your eye if it'll change the way you feel
[Outro]
That's some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
(Some kind of love)
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
(Some kind of love)
Some kind of love, what are you holding on to?
(Some kind of love)
Some kind of love when you're scared you're gonna lose
(Some kind of love, some kind of love)
(Some kind of love, some kind of love)
