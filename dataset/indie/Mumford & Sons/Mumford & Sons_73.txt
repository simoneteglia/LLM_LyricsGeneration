[Intro]
1, 2, 3
[Verse 1]
All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
[Verse 2]
And I know you claim
That you're alright
But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again
[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
[Verse 3]
Relate to my youth
Well I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you
[Verse 4]
But don't just slip away
In the night
Don't just hurl
Your words from on high
[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
[Bridge]
If we come back and we're broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we'll go your way
[Chorus]
'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
