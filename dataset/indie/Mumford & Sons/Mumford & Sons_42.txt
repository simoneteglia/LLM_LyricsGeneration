[Verse 1]
Your eyes, they tie me down so hard
I'll never learn to put up a guard
So keep my love, my candle bright
Learn me hard, oh, learn me right
[Break]
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
[Verse 3]
Though I may speak some tongue of old
Or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength from which to speak
When you sit me down and see I'm weak
[Chorus]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
They'll fulfill our dreams and we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
[Verse 2]
So as we walked through fields of green
Was the fairest sun I'd ever seen
And I was broke, I was on my knees
And you said, "Yes", as I said, "Please"
[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't no sham
I am what I am
I leave no ties
For a cynic's mind
[Chorus]
We will run and scream
You will dance with me
Fulfill our dreams and we'll be free
And we will be who we are
And they'll heal our scars
Sadness will be far away
[Outro]
Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
As it keeps my heart and soul in it's place
And I will love with urgency, but not with haste
