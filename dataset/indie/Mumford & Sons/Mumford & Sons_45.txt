[Verse 1]
We saw birth and death
Can't we be still
What makes you kind
From where comes your sparkling mind
[Verse 2]
Was it under the earth
Tied up in a knot
Which I forgot you were ever there
[Bridge]
Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
[Chorus]
What’s that I see?
I think it's The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me
[Verse 4]
It was ever thus
Up from the dust
Inconceivable love
[Chorus]
What's that I see?
I think it’s The Wild
Puts the fear of God in me
