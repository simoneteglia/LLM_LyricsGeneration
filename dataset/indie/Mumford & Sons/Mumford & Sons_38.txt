Well love was kind
For a time
Now just aches
And it makes me blind
This mirror holds
My eyes too bright
I can't see
The others in my life
Were we too young
Our heads too strong
To bear the weight
Of these lovers' eyes
Cause I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Beneath the curse
Of these lovers' eyes
[Hook]
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes
Cause there's no drink
Or drug I've tried
To rid the curse of
These lovers' eyes
And I feel numb
Beneath your tongue
Your strength just makes me feel less strong
[Hook]
But do not ask the price I paid
I must live with my quiet rage
Tame the ghosts in my head
That run wild and wish me dead
Should you shake my ash to the wind
Lord forget all of my sins
Oh let me die where I lie
'Neath the curse of my lovers' eyes
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
And I'll walk slow, I'll walk slow
Take my hand, help me on my way
