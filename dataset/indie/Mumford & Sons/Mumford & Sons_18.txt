[Verse 1]
You heard my voice
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name
[Verse 2]
So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start
[Pre-Chorus]
So, when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
[Chorus]
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
[Verse 3]
I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine
[Verse 4]
So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old
[Pre-Chorus]
So, when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road
[Chorus]
But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
[Outro]
And I will learn, I will learn
To love the skies I'm under
And I will learn, I will learn
To love the skies I'm under
The skies I'm under
