[Verse 1]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free
Har har, har har
Har har, har har
[Chorus]
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
[Verse 2]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Har har, har har
Har har, har har
[Bridge]
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love
You invest your life
In these bodies we will live
In these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love
You invest your life
[Chorus]
Yeah
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
For you were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker
