[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno
I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around
[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills
[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air
[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
[Verse 4]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie
And she's my hearts delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me
[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight
