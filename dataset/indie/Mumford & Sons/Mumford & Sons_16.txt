[Verse 1]
And in time
This one reminds the other of a past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?
A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I had been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same
[Chorus]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed, because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
[Verse 2]
Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
And crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time
And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?
[Chorus]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed, because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
[Bridge]
Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one
[Verse 3]
Careful hands
Been wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh, love
Is there another way?
[Chorus]
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed, because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
And now I'm losing you
[Instrumental Outro]
