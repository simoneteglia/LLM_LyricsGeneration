She sits him down in a stiff chair
Rubs his back and strokes his hair
Telling him it's okay to cry but he just sits and stares
The merciless moon outside, has nothing now he's come to realize
Only the desolation he feels, the cold distance inside
[Chorus]
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
While the priest just sits and weeps
Lamenting the fact that he can see
Darkness and light in so much detail he has given himself over
Refusing what he knows to be real
Turns away from every meal
Starving himself of goodness
He don't think he can heal
[Chorus]
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
"What if I've lost all I had?"
Says the stranger to his dad
And the witness is confused
He can't tell what is bad
Instead he runs up to the nearest girl
And he comments on her glorious curls
Says, "darling, come with me"
I'll show you a whole new world
[Chorus]
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
