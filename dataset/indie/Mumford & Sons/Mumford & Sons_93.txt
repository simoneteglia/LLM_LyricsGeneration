[Verse 1]
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
We will meet back on this road
Nothing gained, truth be told
But I am not the enemy
It isn't me, the enemy
[Chorus]
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?
[Verse 2]
Give me hope in silence
It's easier, it's kinder
Tell me not of heartbreak
It plagues my soul, it plagues my soul
And bury me beside you
I have no hope in solitude
And the world will follow
To the earth down below
[Chorus]
But I came and I was nothing
And time will give us nothing
So why did you choose to lean on
A man you knew was falling?
