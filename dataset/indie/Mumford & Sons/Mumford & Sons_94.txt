[Verse 1]
You hold your truth so purely
Swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the Devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine
[Chorus]
But fingers tap into what you were once
Now I'm worried that I blew my only chance
[Verse 2]
Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark
I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad but I'm not a fraud
I'd set out to serve the Lord
But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I love
Under the sun!
Under the sun!
[Chorus]
But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
Fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
[Outro]
But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head
Let's live while we are young
While we are young
While we are young
While we are young
