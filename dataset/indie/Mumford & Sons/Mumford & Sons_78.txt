[Verse 1]
It's no slip of the tongue
So let it all out, let it all out
Don't you act like you're stunned
It didn't all come from me
Did it all come from me?
I'm red, I'm raring, I'm out of breath
Your burning stare holding down my chest, chest
[Chorus]
So if this is love, love, love
Then why do you
You even bother?
[Verse 2]
Piercing words script the night
Then you force me to the floor
You pull me to the floor
But you won't see inside
This beating head, this wailing head
[Chorus]
So if this is love, love, love
Then why do you
You even bother?
