[Verse 1]
Fold your hair behind your ears
Roll your questions across the floor
I know we've been here for years
But at least we been here before
My mind finds peace in the shade of your attention
But gets tangled by the night
I didn’t know what I was thinking
But I know we'll be alright
[Chorus]
And I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
So long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon
My Rose of Sharon
[Verse 2]
Come crashing in like a wildfire, I’m left in awe of you
Every time I close the door, I'm left wanting more of you
I wish I had some grand sense of occasion
But I just smile and turn away
I hope you know by now
I don't know another way
[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said and done
I am yours forever
Like I said, I'm done
I am yours forever
[Chorus]
I will surround you
With a love too deep for words
Hold you from the world and its curse
Long as I have breath in my lungs
Long as there's a song to be sung
I will be yours and you will be mine
Ever our lives entwined
My Rose of Sharon
My Rose of Sharon
[Outro]
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
With a love too deep for words
I am yours forever
