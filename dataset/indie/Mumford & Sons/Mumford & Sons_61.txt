And I'm done being tired, so right now I'm inspired
(
Welcome to the revelation
)
I was once underwater and now I'm on fire
(
Welcome to the revelation
) (
Jump
)
And I feel it in the air that Mother Earth ain't steady
Feel so alive even though times are deadly
[Pre-Chorus: Marcus Mumford,
Native Vocalists & Pharrell Williams
]
And in my soul (
Get ready
)
Something is stirring now (
Get ready
)
And I'm not worried (
Get ready
)
You better get ready to see now
[Chorus: Marcus Mumford]
Good people been down for so long
And now it's like thе sun is rising
Good people been down for so long
And now I see the sun is rising

Long was thе night, but you know we've been dreaming
(
Welcome
) (
Dance

To the

So long
) (
Revelation
)
The city's getting loud 'cause the mountains are screaming
(
Welcome to the revelation
) (
Mmm, yeah
)
When you've been through it all, and it won't get no worse
And the first shall be lost, and the last shall be first
[Pre-Chorus: Marcus Mumford,
Native Vocalists & Pharrell Williams

And in my soul (
Get ready
) (
Help
)
Something is stirring now (
Get ready
)
But I'm not worried (
Get ready
)
You better get ready to see now
[Chorus: Marcus Mumford,
Marcus Mumford & Pharrell Williams

Good people been down
for so long
And now it's like the sun is
rising
Good people
been down for so long
And now I see
the sun is rising
