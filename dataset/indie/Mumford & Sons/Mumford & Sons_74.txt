[Verse 1]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
Lend me your hand and we'll conquer them all
But lend me your heart and I'll just let you fall
Lend me your eyes I can change what you see
But your soul you must keep, totally free
[Pre-Chorus]
Har har, har har
Har har, har har
[Chorus]
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
[Verse 2]
How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
I struggle to find any truth in your lies
And now my heart stumbles on things I don't know
My weakness I feel I must finally show
[Pre-Chorus]
Har har, har har
Har har, har har
[Bridge]
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
Where you invest your love, you invest your life
In these bodies we will live, in these bodies we will die
And where you invest your love, you invest your life
(Hey!)
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Awake my soul
Awake my soul
[Outro]
For you were made to meet your maker
Come on Denver!
Awake my soul, awake my soul
You were made to meet your maker
You were made to meet your maker
Ah-ah
