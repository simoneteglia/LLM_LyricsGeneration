[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I will roll away mine
And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside
[Verse 2]
You told me that I would find a home
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals
[Chorus]
And darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
[Post-Chorus]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But you say "That's exactly how this grace thing works"
It's not the long walk home that will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with every start
[Chorus]
Darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
Well, darkness is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I see
Ahh
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Stars hide your fires
For these here are my desires
And I won't give them up to you this time around
And so I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking the territory of this newly impassioned soul
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
You, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine
[Outro]
Thank you very much
Yeah, so this is our second night here. And to be honest with you, I was just nervous.  But tonight, um, I really wanna enjoy it, 'cause it's fun. And so far, you're very much helping with that, so thank you
