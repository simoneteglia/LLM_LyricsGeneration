[Verse 1]
Touch my mouth and hold my tongue
I'll never be your chosen one
I'll be home, safe and tucked away
Well, you can't tempt me if I don't see the day
[Verse 2]
The pull on my flesh was just too strong
Stifled the choice and the air in my lungs
Better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
'Cause when I open my body, I breathe a lie
[Pre-Chorus]
But I will not speak of your sin
There was a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shot
And oh, my heart was flawed, I knew my weakness
So hold my hand, consign me not to darkness
[Chorus]
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road, and I fucked it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace?
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road, and I
fuck
ed it all away
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace?
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
So crawl on my belly 'til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I can take the road, and I can fuck it all away
But in this twilight, our choices seal our fate
