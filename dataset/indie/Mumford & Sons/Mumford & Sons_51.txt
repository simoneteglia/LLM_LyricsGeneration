Don't let me darken your door
That's not what I came here for
No it's not what I came here for
And I won't hear you cry when I'm gone
I won't know if I'm doing you wrong
I never know if I'm doing you wrong
[Hook]
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't fade away
So watch the world tear us apart
A stoic mind and bleeding heart
You never see my bleeding heart
And your lights always shining on
And I been traveling oh so long
I been traveling oh so long
[Hook]
A constant reminder of where I can find her
Light that might give up the way
It's all that I'm asking for without her I'm lost
But my love don't' fade away
Oh my love don't fade away
