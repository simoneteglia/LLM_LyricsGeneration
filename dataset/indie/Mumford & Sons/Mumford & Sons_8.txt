[Verse 1]
Woman
Caught behind those burning eyes
Tangled up in morning white
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
[Verse 2]
Woman
Watch her take me by surprise
When she lets me call her mine
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know the loneliness you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again
[Chorus]
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time, oh-oh-ohh
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again, oh-oh-ohh
I am left in awe of the woman I adore
[Verse 3]
Woman
I never had such a sight
Burn itself onto my mind
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But say the sun doesn't shine for you
I hope you learn that that's not true, in time
When you're gone again
Just as long again
[Chorus]
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
As the night ascends, all will slow again
But I am left in awe of the woman I adore
I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time
There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes
But as the night ascends, all will slow again
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore
