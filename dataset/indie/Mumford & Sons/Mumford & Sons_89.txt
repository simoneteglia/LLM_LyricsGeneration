[Verse 1: Dharohar Project]
Kala patta ri mehendadi
Hariya patta ri mehendadi
O ri jiro raato-rang
Rach rahi Gori re haath mein
Aeji, mharo mohi linu mann
[Chorus: Laura Marling]
Perhaps I'll be a bird one day
If I am good enough
And I'll spread out and fly away
And give up all this stuff
And I am from a country land
Where beauty only grows
And though I'd love to leave some day
I'd dare not ever go
And should you see my sister
She is small and gold
They will not hear a word you say
They don't believe in souls
[Verse 2: Dharohar Project]
Mehendi vavaru Dhola Maadwe
Jado-Tato gayo re Gujarat
Mehendi rang laagi
Jado-Tato gayo re Gujarat
Mehendi rang laagi
Chhoto devariyo ladlo, sa ladlo, koye?
Layo layo mehendi walo jhaad
Mehendi rang laagi
Layo layo mehendi walo jhaad
Mehendi rang laagi
Mehendi rang laagi
Mehendi rang laagi
[Chorus: Laura Marling]
Perhaps I'll be a bird one day
If I'm good enough
And I'll get up and fly way
And give up all this stuff
And I am from a country land
Where beauty only grows
And though I'd dream to leave some day
I'd dare not ever go
And should you see my sisters
They are small and gold
They will not hear a word you say
They don't believe in souls
[Verse 3: Dharohar Project]
Kaai bole jine yun kayo
Sa, yun kayo
"Thari Gori jani udhawe kala kaag"
Mehendi rang laagi
"Thari Gori jani udhawe kala kaag"
Mehendi rang laagi
Mehendi rang laagi
Mehendi rang laagi
[Outro: Laura Marling]
I am no deceiver
I am a believer
I am no deceiver
Mehendi rang laagi
