I just feel like this whole generation maybe need to all eat a steak, you know. Maybe they just need to quit eating, you know, vegetarian food, and get out there and get some blood pumping on their system.
You know, I mean, rock n' roll is not about 'happy, happy, happy, everything's okay, we're The Lumineers, let's clog dance.'
Hey, there's a place for that. If I wanted to go see a great clog dancing band, I'd go see The Lumineers.
Mumford & Sons are great at what they do, but it's not rock n' roll.
Don't call it rock 'n roll. That's an offense to rock n' roll.

Your take on modern rock n' roll?
[Alice Cooper]
Well, for one thing, I guess I get that they want to be folk rock, you know. And I guess they wanna look like everybody else.
I'm old school when it comes to - if you're in a band, you're an outlaw
. You don't play by those rules.
You're a rock n' roll outlaw.
Doesn't mean you have to be on drugs. Doesn't mean you have to be a, you know.
But, when you get on stage, you don't play the guitar up here, and it's not an acoustic guitar
.
You play the guitar down here. It doesn't come to from brain, it comes from your guts. It comes from your groin. Rock n' roll is played down here. It's sexual. It's tribal
. And I'm seeing this: 'oh, I hate oil and I hate war. And I hate all bad things that I don't like. Be my girl.' You know. And I'm going, 'what?' And then I look at a magazine and it says, 'best new rock band.' And I look and I go, 'rock bands don't have accordions or lutes in them. Or flutes.
Unless, maybe, you're Jethro Tull
.' Finally, I'd just be like, 'okay. If you guys don't want to be rock bands, great. Cool, that's better for us. There's more for the Foo Fighters, more for Green Day, more for the bands that really are rock bands. Great. But I don't understand why everybody is so afraid to be in a rock band. You don't want to offend anybody.
