[Verse 1]
Woman
Caught behind those burning eyes
Tangled up in morning white
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
[Verse 2]
Woman
Watch her take me by surprise
When she lets me call her mine
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know the darkness that you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again
Just as long again
[Chorus]
I can't read your mind, though I'm trying all the time, oh
There's something I don't know; I can see it in your eyes, oh
But as the night ascends, all will slow again, oh
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore, oh
[Verse 3]
Woman
Smile and say I move too fast
As you join me in our trials
Can you ever really know?
Do you ever really know?
[Verse 4]
Woman
I never had such a sight
Burn itself onto my mind
Do you ever really know?
Can you ever really know?
[Pre-Chorus]
But say the sun doesn't shine for you
I hope you learn that that's not true, in time
I don't know the loneliness you've known
I don't hear the frosty words echo inside
When you're gone again
Just as long again
[Chorus]
I can't read your mind, though I'm trying all the time, oh
There's something I don't know; I can see it in your eyes, oh
But as the night ascends, all will slow again, oh
And I am left in awe of the woman I adore, oh
