[Verse 1]
Mortal once again
Making out what's make-pretend
And you whisper words forbidden
To see if I've been listening
Well, now I'm listening
[Verse 2]
We won't both get our way
If we do, it won't be tonight anyway
So I hold you by the jaw
And kiss you to be sure
With so much more than before
[Chorus]
It took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With this everlasting glance
[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have you any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway
[Verse 3]
I guess I asked for the truth
I guess I asked for it brutal and untuned
But tonight, it sounds improvised
Whatever has you so inspired
Well, I know you're inspired
[Verse 4]
And no one is better armed
To tear me down with a sleight of the tongue
And I could do the same
And see how long you can keep face
Let's see you keeping face
[Chorus]
But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With this everlasting glance
[Post-Chorus]
I wouldn't have it any other way
Who wants a love that makes sense anyway
I wouldn't have you any other way
I don't want a love that makes sense anyway
[Chorus]
But it took a wild heart to tame mine
And it took a wild heart to charm
Now a wild heart's gone and floored me
With this everlasting glance
With her everlasting glance
