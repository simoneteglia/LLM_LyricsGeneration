[Verse 1]
You hold your truth so purely
And swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine
[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
[Verse 2]
Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I loved
Under this sun!
Under this sun!
[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
[Outro]
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head; let's live while we are young
While we are young
While we are young
While we are young
