[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Wide eyed with a heart made full of fright
Your eyes follow like tracers in the night
And the tightrope, that you wander every time
You have been weighed, you have been found wanting
[Chorus]
Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanting ways
I wanna learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Shelter, you better keep the wolf back from the door
He wanders ever closer every night
And how he waits, bayin' for blood
I promised you everything would be fine
[Chorus]
Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I wanna learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Hold my gaze, love, you know I want to let it go
We will stare down at the wonder of it all
And I will hold you in it
And I will hold you in it
[Chorus]
Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I wanna look you in the eye
'Cause you were all I ever longed for
Been wandering for days
How you felt me slip your mind
Leave behind your wanton ways
I wanna learn to love in kind
'Cause you were all I ever longed for
