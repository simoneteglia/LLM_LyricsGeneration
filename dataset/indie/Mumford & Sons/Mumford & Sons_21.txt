So we were out
Thowin' dice in the dark
I saw you late, last night, come to harm
I saw you dance, in the devil's arms
The night kept coming
Really nothing I could do
Eyes with a fire, unquenched, by peace
Cass the beauty, Cass the queen
So we come
To a place of no return
Yours is the face, which makes my body burn
And here is the name, that our sons will learn:
Cass the beauty, Cass the queen
Cass the beauty, lead me
So when you're weak
When you are on your knees
I'll do my best, with the time, that's left
Swan with your spirit, you are fully flesh
So fuck your dreams
Don't you pick at our seams
I'll turn into a monster for you, if you pay me enough
None of this counts, if you just, plough it up
So we come
To a place of no return
Yours is the face, which makes my body burn
And here is the name, that our sons will learn:
Cass the beauty, Cass the queen
Cass the beauty, lead me
