[Intro]
This song's called, "I Gave You All"
[Verse 1]
Rip the earth in two with your mind
Seal the urge which ensues with brass wires
I never meant you any harm
But your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearms
But close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
How can you say that your truth is better than ours?
Shoulder to shoulder, now brother, we carry no arms
And the blind man sleeps in the doorway, his home
If only I had an enemy bigger than my apathy I could have won
[Chorus]
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Close my eyes for a while
Force from the world a patient smile
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
[Bridge]
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
Just to say that you've won
And you rip it from my hands
And you swear it's all gone
And you rip out all I had
Just to say that you've won
Well, now you've won
Well, now you've won
[Outro]
But I gave you all
I gave you all
I gave you all
