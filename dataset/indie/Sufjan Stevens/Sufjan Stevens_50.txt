Oh no, there I go twisting your arm
Oracle ghost
, love me completely in song
Methodist summer camp
:
you show me yours, show you mine
Sensitive thunder clap
, slip beneath sleeping bag spine
Run, radiator, run:
red-headed horny-eyed friend
Run Taurobolium, blood that ran off from the stem
Go slow, Pandemos, fill of me
Cherokee jeep in the yard
Pull off your running shoes,
sweet Callipygian
Guardian goddess
, my guard
Half shell, half undressed lover of mine
Born Aphrogenia
,
jealousy drink of your wine
Crazed nymphomania
,
touch me if touching's no sin
Heart-shaped
anemone felt from within
Don't go, Pandemos, fill of me
I never meant to do harm, to you, to love
Go slow, Pandemos, fill of me
I never meant to do harm, to you, to love
