[Intro]
2, 3, 4
[Verse 1]
Suppose the world was not informed
By real estate or power lines?
The
hidden river
of my life
Pursued by love
The whispering stone, the valley ford
The candy corn, the spirit finds
Abuse has left me on my side
A single stone
[Chorus 1]
I'm a walker, I'm a dreamer
Treehouse greeter,
pentecostal preacher
I'm a rocker, yeah, I'm a schemer
Compost preacher
, pioneer believer
[Verse 2]
A small betrayal, a simple thought
To shrug it off, unoccupied
The precious lake, the riverbed
The rising tide
The sad surprise,
the day of flags
The flooding fox, the clever chime
Awake my soul, awake my heart
And you will find
[Chorus 2]
I'm a walker, I'm a drinker
Safeway
shopper,
thunderegg
reader
I'm a
biker
, yeah,
I'm a beaver
Web-foot walker
,
trailblazing fever
I'm a lover, yeah, I'm a reaper
Subaru driver
, satellite receiver
I'm a trucker, yeah, I'm a chaser
Pig-n-Ford
rider,
I'm a Nike racer
