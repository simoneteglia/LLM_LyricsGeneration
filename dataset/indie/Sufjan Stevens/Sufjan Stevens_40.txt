[Verse 1]
As if you know the story of
Wallowa Lake:
Leviathan first hid in the deep where her children sleep
She kept them hidden from the plague
But have you heard the story of my mother’s fate?
She left us in Detroit in the rain with a pillowcase
Fortune for the paperweight
[Verse 2]
We followed her to Joseph, near the Indian raid
She wept among the weeds,
hide and seek, for the fallen chief
Spathiphyllum
on
his grave
And like the cedar waxwing, she was drunk all day
We put her in the sheet, little wreath, candles on the crate
As the
monster showed its face
[Chorus 1]
As she waits for her children in the shade
Demogorgon or demigod the ghost parade
No oblation will bring her back to our place
[Verse 3]
She stayed within the deep end of Wallowa Lake
The undertow refrained with
the flame of a feathered snake
Charybdis in its shallow grave
She gave us one last feature, the fullness of her face
In the shade of
"Hin-mah-too-yah…", Red Napoleon
As the demon took her place
[Chorus 2]
As we wait for the waters to reside
Her remarkable stoicism and her pride
When the dragon submerged we knew she had died
[Instrumental Outro]
