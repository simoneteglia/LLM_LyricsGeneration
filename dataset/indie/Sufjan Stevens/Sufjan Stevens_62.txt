[Verse 1]
A break in the clouds is a break in my day
Face the sun of my salvation
As Hathaway Jones would have made it his own fate
Fly by the wings of your creation
[Chorus 1]
On the top of your head, there is a poem
The thought in my head, oh God only knows
As everything else will disappoint you
I used to be young and bold, but now I'm afraid, I'm getting so old
I follow delight to the
City of Roses
[Verse 2]
It's a little-known fact that I can't cope
Iâ€™m the champion of repression
I've had it enough with the east coast
I'll die by the wings of my ambition
[Chorus 2]
The city I left, the city of throes
The one that I loved, the city of hope
As everything else will disappoint you
I used to be young and bold, but now I'm of age, I'm getting so old
I follow delight to the
City of Roses
A break in the clouds is a break in my day
