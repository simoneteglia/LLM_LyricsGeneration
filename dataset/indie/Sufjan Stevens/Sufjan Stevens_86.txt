[Verse 1: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
All my life was calling
All my dreams were buried away
You love me, but you don't know me
In due time you'll throw it away
[Pre-Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
I'll be there to play my part
Want to keep us safe from harm
But a love was in my heart
That I feel now
[Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
Though it wasn't there
Get it back, get nowhere
Get it right, follow my heart
Back to, back to Oz
Where I was born at the start
Don't be my last call
Do you mind that I'm falling apart?
[Verse 2: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
I can deal with falling
All good reasons carried away
You want me, but you can't own me
I survived, but I'm still afraid
[Pre-Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
Tell me this (Tell me this)
Do you see (Do you see)
Me cry? (Do you see me cry?)
Do you wish (Do you wish)
I could (I could)
Reply? (I could reply)
Would a kiss (Would a kiss)
Make it (Make it)
Alright? (Make it alright)
What I feel (What I feel)
Now
[Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
Lord, I wasn't there
Send it back to nowhere
Get it right, follow my heart
Back to, back to Oz
Where I was born at the start
Don't be my lost cause
Do you mind that I'm falling apart?
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
I'll be there (I'll be there)
To play (To play)
My part (To play my part)
Want to keep (Want to keep)
Us safe (us safe)
From harm (Us safe from harm)
But a love (But a love)
Was in (Was in)
My heart (Was in my heart)
That I feel (that I feel)
Now
[Chorus: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo de Augustine]
Though it wasn't there
Get it back, get nowhere
Get it right, follow my heart
Back to, back to Oz
Where I was born at the start
Don't be my last call
Do you mind that I'm falling apart?
