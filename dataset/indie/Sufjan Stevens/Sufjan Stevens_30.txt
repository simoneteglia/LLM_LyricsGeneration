[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4
[Verse 1: Matt Morgan & Sufjan Stevens]
Our step mom we did everything to hate her
She took us down to the edge of Decatur
We saw the lion and the kangaroo take her
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator
[Verse 2: Matt Morgan & Sufjan Stevens]
Sangamon River it overflowed
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
Civil war skeletons in their graves
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator
[Verse 3: Matt Morgan & Sufjan Stevens]
The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We go riding on the abolition grain train
Stephen A. Douglas was a great debater
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator
[Verse 4: Matt Morgan & Sufjan Stevens]
Chickenmobile with your rooster tail
I had my fill and I know how bad it feels
Stay awake and watch for the data
No small Caterpillar,
go congratulate her
[Chorus: Matt Morgan &
Sufjan Stevens
]
Denominator, go Decatur, go Decatur
(It's the great I Am)
Abominate her, go Decatur, why did we hate her?
(It's the great I Am)
Denominator, go Decatur, anticipate her
(It's the great I Am)
Appreciate her, appreciate her
Stand up and thank her
[Outro: Matt Morgan &
Sufjan Stevens
]
Stand up and thank her
(It's the great I Am)
Stand up and thank her
(It's the great I Am)
Stand up and thank her
(It's the great I Am)
Stand up and thank her
