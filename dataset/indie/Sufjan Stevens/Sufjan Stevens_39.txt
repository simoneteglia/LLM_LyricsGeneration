[Verse 1]
Once when our mother called
She had a voice of last year's cough
We passed around the phone
Sharing a word about Oregon
[Chorus]
When my turn came, I was ashamed
When my turn came, I was ashamed
[Verse 2]
Once when we moved away
She came to Romulus for a day
Her Chevrolet broke down
We prayed it'd never be fixed or be found
[Chorus]
We touched her hair, we touched her hair
We touched her hair, we touched her hair
[Verse 3]
When she had her last child
Once when she had some boyfriends, some wild
She moved away quite far
Our grandpa bought us a new VCR
[Chorus]
We watched it all night, we grew up in spite of it
We watched it all night, we grew up in spite of it
[Verse 4]
We saw her once last fall
Our grandpa died in a hospital gown
She didn't seem to care
She smoked in her room and colored her hair
[Chorus]
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed, I was ashamed of her
