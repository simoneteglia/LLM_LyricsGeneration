Tonya Harding, my star
Well this world is a cold one
But it takes one to know one
And God only knows what you are
Just some Portland white trash
You confronted your sorrow
Like there was no tomorrow
While the rest of the world only laughed
Triple axel on high
A delightful disaster
You jumped farther and faster
You were always so full of surprises
Are your laces untied?
What’s the frown on your face for?
And just what are the skates for now?
Tell me which is your good side?
Are you lonely at night?
Do you miss all the glory
And the mythical story
Of the Olympian life?
Yamaguchi in red
She had high rise and roses
And red-carpet poses
And her outfit was splendid
Nancy Kerrigan’s charm
Well she took quite a beating
So you’re not above cheating
Can you blame her for crying?
Tonya, you were the brightest
Yeah you rose from the ashes
And survived all the crashes
Wiping the blood from your white tights
Has the world had its fun?
Yeah they’ll make such a hassle
And they’ll build you a castle
Then destroy it when they’re done
Tonya Harding, my friend
Well this world is a bitch, girl
Don’t end up in a ditch, girl
I’ll be watching you close to the end
So fight on as you are
My American princess
May God bless you with incense
You’re my shining American star
Shining American star
Shining American star
Shining American star
Shining American star
