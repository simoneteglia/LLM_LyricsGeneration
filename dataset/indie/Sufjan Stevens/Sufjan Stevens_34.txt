After the storm, we shaved our legs to the skin
Into the snow, our footprints showed where we'd been
They gave us names, they said my name means war
Dwelling in song, the lion and the lamb were restored
Illumination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
Hallucination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
I lit a fire and drank off the breath of his kiss
My tambourine affirmed by the dance of his
wrist
Mystical star, burn bright like the tail of a dog
And now we are blessed with the righteousness of the Lord
Illumination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
Hallucination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
Illumination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
Hallucination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
Illumination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
Hallucination, accede my need, my Rajneesh
I'm on the path of love,
I'm on a parrot
Possess me with prayer on the bluff
I'm on a task for God
Entheogen
, you lift me within
Upanishad
Bright as a thunderbird, singing
You stare at the sun to see the sublime
Forgetting the light that makes you go blind
Osho you ask of us singing
If courage is love of the unknown
Consider the powers parading you home
I'm on the path of love saying
You stand in the shade to feel it was blessed
Obscuring from light the seeds you possess
I'm on the path of trust, singing
Whatever it takes, receive of the light
Terror will take whatever it likes
(It's in your favor)
Stare at the sun to see the sublime
Forgetting the light that makes you go blind
(It's in your favor)
Whatever it takes receive of the light
Terror will take whatever it likes
[Instrumental]
