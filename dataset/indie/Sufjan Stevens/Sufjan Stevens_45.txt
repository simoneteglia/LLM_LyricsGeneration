[Full Title: "
The Black Hawk War
, or,
How to Demolish an Entire Civilization and Still Feel Good About Yourself in the Morning
, or,
We Apologize for the Inconvenience
but You're Going to Have to Leave Now, or, '
I Have Fought the Big Knives and Will Continue to Fight Them Until They Are Off Our Lands!
