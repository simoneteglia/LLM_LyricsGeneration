[Verse 1]
So you are tired of us
So rest your head
Turning back fourteen years
Of
what I did and said
[Verse 2]
So you are breathing disaster
I did what I was told
But I was a man born invisible
Was it something I said or some kind of joke?
[Verse 3]
So you are tired as the sun
Are you with or without a friend?
Bring me back everything caught in your shield
Let everything else descend
[Verse 4]
So you are seething with laughter
Was it really all just a joke?
I was a man indivisible
When everything else was broke
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
[Verse 5]
So you are tired of evеn my kiss
So go back to your den
Throwing out everything lеft in your field
When there was nothing left to defend
[Verse 6]
So you are dreaming of after
Was it really all just for fun?
I was the man still in love with you
When I already knew it was done
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah
[Verse 7]
So you are tired of me
So rest your head
Turning back all that we had in our life
While I return to death
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh
Ooh, ooh
Ahh
