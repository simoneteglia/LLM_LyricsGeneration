[Verse 1]
Love yourself
You are the one thing
I needed
Share of yourself
Show me the things that
You believe in
[Chorus]
Love, can you love yourself?
Show me everything
Every reason to believe in yourself
[Verse 2]
Make a shelf
Put all the things on
That you believe in
[Chorus]
Love, can you love yourself?
Show me everything
Every reason to believe in yourself
[Post-Chorus]
Love yourself
You are the one thing
I believe in
[Chorus]
Love, can you love yourself?
Show me everything
Every reason to believe in yourself
[Verse 3]
Make a shelf
Put all the things on
That you believe in
[Chorus]
Love, can you love yourself?
Show me everything
Every reason to believe in yourself
Love, can you love yourself?
Show me everything
Every reason to believe in yourself
[Outro]
Love, can you love yourself?
(You are the one thing)
Show me everything
Every reason to believe in yourself
(You are the one thing)
Love, can you love yourself?
(You are the one thing)
Show me everything
Every reason to believe in yourself
