[Verse 1]
If I am alive this time next year
Will I have arrived in time to share?
And mine is about as good this far
And I'm still applied to what you are
[Chorus 1]
And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you
[Verse 2]
And I heard from the trees a great parade
And I heard from the hills a band was made
And will I be invited to the sound?
And will I be a part of what you've made?
[Chorus 2]
And I am throwing all my thoughts away
And I'm destroying every bet I've made
And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you
For you
