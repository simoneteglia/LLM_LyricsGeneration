[Verse 1]
Can you lift me up to a higher place?
Forget everything that was before
Turn your face around like a salted sphere
Turn yourself around to see what once was there
[Chorus]
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises
[Verse 2]
Jesus lift me up to a higher plane (
To a higher plane
)
Can you come around before I go insane? (
Before I go insane
)
Cast me not in hell, where the demons rage (
While my demons rage
)
Turn yourself around to see what I can say (
To see what I can say
)
[Chorus]
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises in a word
Everything that rises must converge
Everything that rises
[Verse 3]
Turn yourself away from the wickedness I said
Evil comes to play in the image of the dead
[Chorus]
Everything rises must converge
Everything rises in a word
Everything rises must converge
Everything rises
[Outro]
Everything rises (
Everything rises
)
Everything rises (
Everything rises
)
Everything rises (
Everything rises
)
Everything rises
