[Verse 1]
Praise the mountain and the rain
All the gifts that still remain
But the greatest gift of all
And the law above all laws
[Chorus 1]
Is to love your friends and lovers
To lay down your life for your brothers
As you abide in peace
So will your delight increase
[Verse 2]
As the mystery of the cross
Asa Lovejoy lost the toss
And the fountain in the rain
Where my sorrow still remains
[Chorus 2]
So I run to my friends and lovers
I lay down my life for my brothers
As I abide in peace
So will my delight increase
