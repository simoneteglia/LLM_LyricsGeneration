[Verse 1]
It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets, I cover up my face
[Bridge]
I do love you
I do, ooh-ooh, love you
[Verse 2]
And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long
[Outro]
But you are the life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
And words are futile devices
