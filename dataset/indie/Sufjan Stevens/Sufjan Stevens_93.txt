[Verse 1]
Oh my friends, I've begun to worry, right
Where I should be grateful, I should be satisfied
Oh my heart, I would clap and dance in place
With my friends, I have so much pleasure to embrace
[Chorus]
But my heart is returned to sister winter
But my heart is as cold as ice
[Verse 2]
Oh my thoughts, I return to summertime
When I kissed your ankle, I kissed you through the night
All my gifts, I gave everything to you
Your strange imagination, you threw it all away
[Chorus]
Now my heart is returned to sister winter
Now my heart is as cold as ice
[Chorus]
All my friends, I've returned to sister winter
All my friends, I apologize, apologize
All my friends, I've returned to sister winter
All my friends, I apologize, apologize
All my friends, I've returned to sister winter
All my friends, I apologize, apologize
La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
[Chorus]
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you all the best
And my friends, I've
Returned to wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
To wish you a happy Christmas
