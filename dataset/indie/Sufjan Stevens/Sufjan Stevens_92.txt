Innocence was never lost
Though it may have been insulted
Even if the Earth forgot
Her inheritance resulted
In contradiction, ceremony
Benediction, hallelujah
There are no more accidents
Living things refuse to offer
Explanations of their worth
We in turn avenge the Author
With paranoia and prediction
Exploration, competition
Ceremony, inner anguish
Lord I pray for us, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
Run, mission, run
Before we arrive
Run, mission, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
Run, nation, run
Before we arrive
I see it
The beauty of the Earth
On my death bed
But it's too late
I'm such an idiot
I see it
The beauty of the Earth
On my death bed
But it's too late
I'm such an idiot
I see it
The beauty of the Earth
On my death bed
I'm such an idiot
