I’m a Christmas unicorn
In a uniform made of gold
With a billy goat beard
And a sorceror’s shield
And mistletoe on my nose
Oh, I’m a Christian holiday
I’m a symbol of original sin
I’ve a pagan tree and magical wreath
And a bowtie on my chin
Oh, I’m a pagan heresy
I’m a tragic-al Catholic shrine
I’m a little bit shy with a lazy eye
And a penchant for sublime
Oh, I’m a mystical apostasy
I’m a horse with a fantasy twist
Though I play all night with my magical kite
People say I don’t exist
For I make no full apology
For the category I reside
I’m a mythical mess with a treasury chest
I’m a construct of your mind
Oh, I’m hysterically American
I’ve a credit card on my wrist
And I have no home nor field to roam
I will curse you with my kiss
Oh, I’m a criminal pathology
With a history of medical care
I’m frantic shopper and a brave pill popper
And they say my kind are rare
But I’ve seen others in the uniform
Of a unicorn just like me
We are legions wide and we choose no sides
We are masters of mystique
For you’re a Christmas unicorn
I have seen you on the beat
You may dress in the human uniform, child
But I know you’re just like me

I’m the Christmas Unicorn
You’re the Christmas Unicorn too
[x7]
I’m the Christmas Unicorn (Find the Christmas Unicorn)
You’re the Christmas Unicorn too (It’s all right, I love you)
[x3]
I’m the Christmas Unicorn (I’m the Christmas Unicorn)
(Find the Christmas Unicorn)
You’re the Christmas Unicorn too (You’re the Christmas Unicorn too)
(It’s all right, I love you)
[x2]
I’m the Christmas Unicorn (I’m the Christmas Unicorn)
(Find the Christmas Unicorn) (apart, my friend)
You’re the Christmas Unicorn too (You’re the Christmas Unicorn too)
(It’s all right, I love you)
[Instrumental]
[x4]
Love, love will tear us apart, again
Love, love will tear us apart, my friend
[x8]
I’m the Christmas Unicorn (Find the Christmas Unicorn)
(Love, love will tear us apart, again)
You’re the Christmas Unicorn (It’s all right, I love you)
(Love, love will tear us apart, my friend)
[Instrumental]
