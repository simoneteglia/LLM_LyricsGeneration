[Intro]
One, two, three
[Verse 1]
My blue bucket of gold
Friend, why don't you love me?
Once the myth has been told
The lens deforms it as lightning
[Chorus]
Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life
(Ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2]
Search for things to extol
Friend, the fables delight me
My blue bucket of gold
Lord, touch me with lightning
[Chorus]
Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
