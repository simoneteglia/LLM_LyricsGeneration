What’s right and what’s wrong?
Don’t you hold me too lightly to words
As I’ve rounded them off to the nearest of ten
For I gathered your body in envious capture in envious thought
Oh forgive me, oh gods or forgive me in fortune
Forgive me in feeling it out for myself
As I ought to have feelings for something
as great as thou art
Some great white rose of youth
Your pleasure gives of my own
heart
Generous portions wisely
Breaks of my own heart
I felt the arm’s length
while I’ve gone on my own way
Conserve me, strange waters
Come and obey me, strange waters
Have it your own way
So if you won’t hold me, I have no objections
So if you won’t please me
I make no commands
So if you don’t trust me, it’s best if I drown
