[Verse 1]
Melancholy creature
Paranoid secret
Hypothetic victim of prediction
I'll consume the child that trails me
The youngest of children
A cannibal addiction
Innocent victim
Bite mark, body part
When in secret siege
We eat them
[Verse 2]
Tell me I'm evil
A capricorn creature
A chemical addiction
First incision
Take this body
Bloodshed for you
Tell me I'm evil
Invisible people
Continual affection for my action
Vampire creature
First born seeker
Ah ah ah, now
Ah ah ah, now
[Refrain]
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not the name of love
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not the face of God
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love
[Bridge]
Where there's joy
I bring you trespass
Where there's light
I bring you darkness
Where there's health
I bring affliction
Where there's hope
I bring misfortune
[Refrain]
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love
Tell me I'm evil
Tell me I'm not love
[Outro]
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
