[Verse 1]
Give myself as a sacrifice
Genuflecting ghost I kiss the floor
Rise, my love, show me paradise
Nothing seems so simple anymore
[Chorus]
Rest assured, words come easy
Insecure, love and please me
Sacred word, bind me, insult
As I praise your name
[Verse 2]
Now we dance in our catastrophe
Ramparts in the sky that flash with horror
Let's take these chances, no more amnesty
Nothing else remains as once before
[Chorus]
Rest assured, empires will fall
Insecure, restless and small
Sacred word, bind me, insult
As I praise your name
[Outro]
Give myself as a sacrifice
Genuflecting ghost I kiss no more
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
