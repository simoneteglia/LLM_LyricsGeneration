Thinking outrageously I write in cursive
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
I see my own breath on the face of the door
Oh I am not quite sleeping
Oh I am fast in bed
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched
North of Savanna we swim in the Palisades
I come out wearing my brother's red hat
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
He runs washing his face in his hands
Oh how I meant to tease him
Oh how I meant no harm
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him
I see the wasp on the length of my arm
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu-
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
[Backing - Simultaneous to above]
Trail of Tears
and
Horseshoe Lake
.
Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
[Backing - Simultaneous to above]
Trusting things beyond mistake
. Hallelu-
[Horn breakdown]
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
[Backing - Simultaneous to above]
Lamb of God, we sound the horn
. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
[Backing - Simultaneous to above]
Unto us your ghost is born.
Hallelu-
I can't explain the state that I'm in
The state of my heart, he was my best friend
Into the car, from the back seat
Oh, admiration in falling asleep
All of my powers, day after day
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed
Deep in the tower, the prairies below
I can tell youâ€” the telling gets old
Terrible sting and terrible storm
I can tell you the day we were born
[Backing - Simultaneous to above]
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu-
My friend is gone, he ran away
I can tell you, I love him each day
[Backing - Simultaneous to above]
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged
I can tell you I love him each day
[Backing - Simultaneous to above]
Trail of Tears
and
Horseshoe Lake
. Hallelu-
Terrible sting, terrible storm
I can tell you...
[Backing - Simultaneous to final stanza]
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
[Backing - Simultaneous to
final stanza]
Trusting things beyond mistake
. Hallelu-
