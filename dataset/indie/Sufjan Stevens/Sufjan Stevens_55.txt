My father, working night, first shift, eternal light
The curse of Adam: labor
Outside in the parking lot, the current of wind and the light went hot
He held his head in terror
By Jove and by surprise
The current of lightning filled with light
It burned his hands with symbols
White noise, as
Lucifer
, the sacred fire, the sacred fern
Conceived with holy water
His radiance in the dark
Mysterious shape or beauty mark
As if it were Minerva
Breastplate of Jupiter
, the hovering deep, as he spoke the word
The light, the virgin creature
All dreams of all disease are fantasy features first conceived
Illusions worth remembering
Our father late at night, forbidding death, he kissed the light
As Jupiter transfigured
I need you to change me, prevent you, persuade me, by Jove
I need you, sensation, by virtue, persuasion, by Jove, by Jove
By Jove
By Jove
Father of light, father of death
,
give us your wisdom, give us your breath
Summoner says that Jupiter is the loneliest planet
Red right eye
, put in its place,
under your foot, carpenter's cape
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet
Floundering star, failed that you are, fevering pitch, figure of speech
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet
Say it with faith, say it with force
Say it to my face, put me in place
Sermon of death says
Jupiter
is the only conquest
Hurricane heart hurricane haste
wandering star, put in its place
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the only contest
Father of light, father of death, give us your wisdom, give us your breath
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet
