[Verse 1]
In the world that you would make up
With unicorns and buffalo packs
I know that you would wake up
With the sunny side touching your back
[Chorus 1]
Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
Coming up with theories on him
Is it the lonely man of Christmas?
He's riding in
the devil's abyss
[Verse 2]
Oh, I would rate the future
If I could put a finger on it
But I have no idea
If what I want is better than this
[Chorus 2]
Is it the lonely man of winter?
I could put my finger on that
Is it the lonely drive to Denver?
The loneliness of Hoppington's hat
[Chorus 3]
Is it the time we spent in silence?
The silence of a winter he had
Is it the lonely man of winter?
I could put my finger on that
[Outro]
And even if it's Christmas
Could we just pretend for a bit
That everything we went through
Was someone else's carpenter kiss
