One two three four
Two two three four
[Verse 1]
Trouble falls in my home
Troubled man, troubled stone
Turn a mountain of lies
Turn a card for my life
Man of steel, man of heart
Tame our ways, if we start
To devise something more
Something halfways
[Chorus 1]
Only a steel man came to recover
If he had run from gold, carry over
We celebrate our sense of each other
We have a lot to give one another
[Verse 2]
I took a bus to the lake
Saw the monument face
Yellow tides, golden eyes
Red and white, red and wise
Raise the flag, summer home
Parted hair and part unknown
If I knew what I read
Iâ€™ll send it halfways
[Chorus 2]
Only a real man can be a lover
If he had hands to lend us all over
We celebrate our sense on each other
We have a lot to give one another
[Verse 3]
Took my bags, Illinois
Dreamt the lake took my boy
Man of steel, man of heart
Turn your ear to my part
There are things you have said
Raise the boat and raise the dead
If you take us away
Still we can say
[Chorus 3]
Only a steel man can be a lover
If he had hands to tremble all over
We celebrate our sense of each other
We have a lot to give one another
Only a steel man can be a lover
If he had hands to tremble all over
We celebrate our sense of each other
We have a lot to give one another
