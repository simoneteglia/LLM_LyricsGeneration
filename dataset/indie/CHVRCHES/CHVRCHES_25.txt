[Verse 1]
Can you tell me what to have and what to hold
If you never take the weight on your own?
No one tells us what is hard and what is fair
And we will deliver once we know where to fall
[Chorus]
We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
[Verse 2]
Can you steady all the hands that you hold
If you never look away from the drop?
If you push yourself, then I will pull you on
And we will deliver once we know where to fall
[Chorus]
We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
[Bridge]
I will wait to see if you come at all
To stop us falling out of phase
Let's see if we can keep track of losing days
You smile so wide, I can see the sides
To stop us falling out of phase
I will be with you in the fray
With those second thoughts you asked for
All you asked for
[Chorus]
We are made of our longest days
We are falling, but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves and make them gold
[Outro]
And make them gold
