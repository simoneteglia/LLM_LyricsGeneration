[Verse 1]
Have you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like something in your teeth?
There's some aces up your sleeve
I have no idea that you're in deep
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee
[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
And I don't know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to
[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
[Outro]
(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(It's sad to see you go)
I've thought of calling, darling
(Baby, we both know)
Do you want me crawling back you you?
