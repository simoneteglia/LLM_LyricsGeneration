[Verse 1]
Maybe I
Tell you that it's no big deal
Maybe I can aim this high
Or maybe I should eat my words
[Pre-Chorus]
Not the same, not the same
You're not the same, not the same
Not the same, not the same
You're not the same, not the same
[Chorus 1]
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
I never do what I used to
[Verse 2]
Maybe you
Could tell 'em that you stayed the course
Maybe I could clear my view
Or maybe I should eat my words
[Pre-Chorus]
Not the same, not the same
You're not the same, not the same
Not the same, not the same
You're not the same, not the same
[Chorus 1]
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
I never do what I used to
I never do what I used to
[Bridge]
Keep you away from the down side of me
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
You can wrap up your hopes and release them to me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
You would be
You would be
You would be
[Chorus 2]
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
All I see and...
[Chorus 1]
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
I never do what I used to
I never do what I used to
