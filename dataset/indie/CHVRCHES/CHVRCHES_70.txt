[Verse]
Sometimes I just feel so tired of it all
Tired of all the anger
All the fake apologies and all the rage
I'm tired of being told to be one or the other
The Madonna or the Whore
The Princess in Distress
I can see right through you
But can you see through me?
I'm running with the scissors that my mother gave to me
Running with my eyes closed
Why do we do the things we do to one another?
Is it enough?
Is it enough yet?
'Cause I've had enough
Maybe the truth exists somewhere between the dark and the light
Or maybe Love Is Dead
