[Verse 1]
Draw a line in the sand
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you
[Chorus]
Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
[Verse 2]
No more time second-guessed
Like there's nothing to forget and nothing to lose
Hold my ground long enough
'Til I see the turning tides are coming from you
[Chorus]
Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
[Bridge]
If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tide
They're spilling over me, filling my insides
If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tide
We wait for the fall
(I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I gotta tell ya)
But I can see the difference (I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I got-got)
But I can see the difference (Got-got, I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I gotta tell ya)
But I can see the difference (I gotta tell ya)
Maybe the water's high (I got-got)
But I know that this is different (Got-got)
[Chorus]
Taking back an empty threat
More than you could ever know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
To try and not forget
Hoping that you never know
Take it back with no regrets
I was better off when I was on your side
And I was holding on
