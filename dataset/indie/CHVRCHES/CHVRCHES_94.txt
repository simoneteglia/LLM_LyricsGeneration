[Verse 1]
Caught out, cold
Hiding from you in a skin so old
I'll come clean
Everyone, everyone knows it's me
[Pre-Chorus]
And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope
[Chorus]
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
[Verse 2]
Blow by blow
Honest in every way I know
You appear
To face the decision I know you fear
[Pre-Chorus]
And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope
[Chorus]
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
[Bridge]
And you know you don't need me
[Pre-Chorus]
And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any colour
I've got the answer
Open the envelope
[Chorus]
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
