[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry]
I will carry you and give you life
I will cover you and show you the way
It's a sequence that you never learned
It's a lesson I will never forget
I can hear you in the overtones
Just an echo of the promise we made
Change the future, we can travel time
Or make us blind, so we can never look back
We can never look back
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
I'm the night sky
I'm the fire in your eyes
And I want you
Now and for all time
I'm the cold heart
I'm the secret that you hide
I'll be listening until you decide
[Verse 2: Lauren Mayberry,
Martin Doherty
]
I communicate in simple streams (
Take your time
)
I'm the only one who gave you the truth (
Speak to me
)
Once you leave me you were really gone (
Far and near
)
Give me something to remember you by (
Always be
)
All that's here is what you left behind (
Majesty
)
Slowly moving in the back of my mind (
Can't forget
)
Take a moment to remember me (
And I will
)
And make me blind so I don't ever look back
[Bridge: Lauren Mayberry]
Only in your name
I will ne'er be free
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
I'm the night sky
I'm the fire in your eyes
And I want you
Now and for all time
I'm the cold heart
I'm the secret that you hide
I'll be listening until you decide
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
I'm the night sky
I'm the fire in your eyes
And I want you
Now and for all time
I'm the cold heart
I'm the secret that you hide
I'll be listening until you decide
I will ne'er be free
