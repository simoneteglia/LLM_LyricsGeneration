[Verse 1]
Everyone sees, but only I know
Nothing to lose, nothing to save to make a whole
What if I should make a loss?
Hold up both my hands, my fingers crossed
I don't sleep well, laying low
Never keepin' up, never lettin' go
What if I should look away?
Every human touch will be repaid
[Pre-Chorus]
Without restraint
Within our veins
[Chorus]
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the sun up off our bones
I never asked to know, never planned
'Til it was swept out of my hands
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the dying light exposed
I never asked to know, never lied
So I could keep you on my side
[Post-Chorus]
We feel the same
Without restraint
We feel the same
Within our veins
[Verse 2]
Everyone comes, but only I stay
Nowhere to look, nowhere to turn to fall away
What if I should call it off?
Hold up my demands with my heart uncrossed
I don't sleep well, laying low
Never keepin' up, never lettin' go
What if I should let it fade?
Every human touch will be repaid
[Pre-Chorus]
Without restraint
Within our veins
[Chorus]
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the sun up off our bones
I never asked to know, never planned
'Til it was swept out of my hands
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the dying light exposed
I never asked to know, never lied
So I could keep you on my side
[Bridge]
We feel the same
Without restraint
We feel the same
Within our veins
We feel the same
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
Without restraint
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
We feel the same
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
Within our veins
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
[Chorus]
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the sun up off our bones
I never asked to know, never planned
'Til it was swept out of my hands
We bide our time, stay afloat
Keepin' the dying light exposed
I never asked to know, never lied
So I could keep you on my side
[Outro]
We feel the same
Without restraint
We feel the same
Within our veins
We feel the same
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
Without restraint
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
We feel the same
(Payin' back all our chances, payin' back what we take)
Within our veins
(Payin' back all our chances, chances, chances)
(Chances, chances, chances, chances)
(Chances, chances, chances, chances)
