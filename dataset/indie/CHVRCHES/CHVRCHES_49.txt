[CHVRCHES「Out of My Head」歌詞]
[Verse 1: KOM_I]
ロンドンモード王道も
清志郎もデヴィッド・ボウイも
とうにとうにいなくなって
キャプチャーコースで違って
悪かないね
SNS working all day
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
And when you figure it out
You let me know
And when you figure it out
You let me know
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
[Verse 2: KOM_I]
川崎もグラスゴーも悪かないね
帰りたくなる
やっぱりまだ帰りたくない
テレビがつきっぱなしの
悪かないね
家の端っこ　おいで
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
And when you figure it out
You let me know
And when you figure it out
You let me know
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
And when you figure it out
You let me know
And when you figure it out
You let me know
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my, out of my head
I need out of my, out of my head
