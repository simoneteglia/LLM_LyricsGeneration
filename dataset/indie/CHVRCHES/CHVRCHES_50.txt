[Verse 1]
I get the last word only because
I write on the walls in my head
Maybe some things are better unsaid
To be left on the sheets of your bed
[Pre-Chorus]
Can I forgive if I forget
All my mistakes and my regrets?
If all of this is for the best?
[Chorus]
I've been singing that song again
Another ballad that won't make amends
It's been giving me nightmares again
And they don't end
I've been singing along again
Another poem designed for revenge
Now I'm living the nightmare again
And it won't end
[Verse 2]
Pity the actor canning the laughter
I know I waited too long
I played so dumb, I was under the thumb
A conclusion far too foregone
[Pre-Chorus]
Can I forgive if I forget
All my mistakes and my regrets?
If all of this is for the best?
[Chorus]
I've been singing that song again
Another ballad that won't make amends
It's been giving me nightmares again
And they don't end
I've been singing along again
Another poem designed for revenge
Now I'm living the nightmare again
And it won't end
[Post-Chorus]
For, for, forgiving
For, for, forgetting
For, for, forgiving
For, for, forgetting
[Bridge]
It might have looked like love, but it tasted a lot like blood
What is it like to be the apple of your own eye?
Always loved, always seen
Always gratified, always heard
Always safe, always satisfied
An ugly song came from a ballad for a friend
If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it never ends
I was no sweet dream, but I was never a nightmare
I'm glad that we can all now stop pretending that you cared
I was no sweet dream, but I was never a nightmare
I love it when you talk about it to people who weren't there
The arrogance and narcissism laid bare
I was no sweet dream, but I was never a nightmare
[Chorus]
I've been singing that song again
Another ballad that won't make amends
It's been giving me nightmares again
And they don't end
I've been singing along again
Another poem designed for revenge
Now I'm living the nightmare again
And it won't end
[Outro]
For, for, forgiving
For, for, forgetting
For, for, forgiving
For, for, forgetting
For, for, forgiving
For, for, forgetting
For, for, forgiving
For, for, forgetting
