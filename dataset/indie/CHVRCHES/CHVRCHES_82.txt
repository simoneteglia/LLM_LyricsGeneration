[Verse 1]
His funeral
The boy you never knew
Last summer's song
Was painted and drawn out from you
So he faded from view
Still I hear him moan
Slowly faded from you
A brittle, twisted bone
[Chorus]
White summer changes everyone
"It's the devil in me that I fear," she said
We're falling, invisible in the rain
White summer changes everything
[Verse 2]
On a train tonight
A movement in the dark
We devour ourselves
Consuming the things that we were
Standing on the old bridge
Water that I could not cross
We return again
To Eden and the fall
[Chorus]
White summer changes everyone
"It's the devil in me that I fear," she said
We're falling, invisible in the rain
White summer changes everything
White summer changes everyone
"It's the devil in me that I fear," she said
We're falling, invisible in the rain
White summer changes everything
