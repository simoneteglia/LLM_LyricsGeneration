[Verse 1]
I'm watching you run
Run from the sidelines
Take in a breath, fill in your lungs
Keeping you alive
No fear, I'll be your eyes
I'll be your lifeline
And if I can be, I'll be your strength
And it won't be long now
[Chorus]
Head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Your head up, head up
Keep holding
[Verse 2]
If you can see and you believe
Why are you so scared?
But if you don't care, then why are we here
And what do you have left?
[Chorus]
Head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
Your head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
[Bridge]
Don't you take another step away from here
"I would go anywhere with you"
What a lie
I'll break down, but you will never see
Tell me, are you happy?
Are you really happy?
[Verse 3]
Stay under the tide
Stay in my eye line
Looking ahead, there is a chance
Wherever it all ends
[Chorus]
Head up, head up
And stay strong
Holding your head up, head up
Keep holding, holding
[Outro]
Slowly cross off the days
That they say you can have
Try to retie the ties
That you will leave behind
Slowly cross off the days
That they say you can have
Try to retie the ties
That you will leave behind
