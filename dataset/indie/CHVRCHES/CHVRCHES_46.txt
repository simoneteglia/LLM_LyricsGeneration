[Verse 1]
I can never tell what you want
Even with time, you never learn to move on
I'm trying my best to lift you up, to repair
But when I stop, you never seem to stay there
[Chorus]
And I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'll wait until you're really gone
And try to find another way
But I cannot stay
[Verse 2]
I can do no right for doing wrong
I'll swallow my pride, I only want to belong
I'm trying my best to toughen up for these days
And maybe I'll find another time for this place
[Chorus]
And I'm holding on, I'm holding on
I'll wait until you're really gone
And try to find another way
But I cannot stay
I'll try to find another way
But I cannot stay
