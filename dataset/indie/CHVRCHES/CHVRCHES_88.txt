[Chorus]
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, oh
What do you mean? I said we're running out of time
What do you mean? (Oh)
What do you mean? You better make up your mind
What do you mean?
[Verse 1]
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Tryin' to catch the beat, make up your heart
I don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you up and you're down, then in between
Oh, I really wanna know
[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean? I said we're running out of time
What do you mean? Oh
What do you mean? You better make up your mind
What do you mean?
[Verse 2]
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Tryin' to compromise, but I can't win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night
First you up and you're down, then in between
Oh, I really wanna know
[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, hey
When you want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
[Bridge]
I wanna know
[Chorus]
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
What do you mean? I said we're running out of time
What do you mean? Oh
What do you mean? You better make up your mind
What do you mean?
[Outro]
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
