[Verse 1]
Cover up, cover up
Cover up that you're ruthless
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's ever gonna notice
And I am catching on and I am seeing red
How about I prove I'm right and raise it overhead?
[Pre-Chorus]
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me you would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
[Chorus]
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
[Verse 2]
Reaching, reaching for
Reaching for my resistance
Nobody, nobody
Nobody sees it at a distance
And I am catching up and I am seeing red
How about I throw my weight and raise it overhead?
[Pre-Chorus]
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me you would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
[Chorus]
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus]
I never promised you anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me you would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
[Chorus]
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it and rise above
