[Intro]
I don't want to say
That I'm afraid to die
I'm no good at goodbyes
I can't apologise
And if I don't stop now
Will it follow me down?
I guess I have to try
It's the art of getting by
[Verse 1]
'Cause I sunk some ships with selfish lips
And it all came back to me
I was terrified
I never told them why
And the songs I wrote 'bout hearts I broke
Would never come for free
I cheated and I lied
But I meant it when I cried
[Chorus]
So what do you say
When you lose your way?
The past is in the past
It isn't meant to last
But if I can't let go
Will you carry me home?
Can we celebrate the end?
I'm asking for a friend
[Verse 2]
'Cause I filled my bed with my regrets
But it hasn't killed me yet
None of it mattered
None of it mattered
And the mess we made on Fridays
Gave me Sundays on my knees
But you still matter
You still matter
[Bridge]
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
You still matter (You still matter)
[Chorus]
I don't want to say
That I'm afraid to die
The past is in the past
It isn't meant to last
But if I can't let go
Will you carry me home?
Can we celebrate the end?
I'm asking for a friend
[Outro]
Home, can we go?
Can we go? Can we go?
Home, can we go?
Can we go? Can we go?
Home, can we go?
Can we go? Can we go?
Home, can we go?
Can we go? Can we go?
