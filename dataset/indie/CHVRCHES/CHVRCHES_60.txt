[Verse 1]
At twenty-four
I fell into the trapdoor
Threw a man overboard
As I swam for the shore
At twenty-five
I noticed red in my skies
Made a bed for his lies
In the whites of my eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
I was naïve
It got harder to breathe
Still, I don't let 'em see
That there's blood on my knees
All that I want
Is to hear that one song
When the noises are gone
I'll be singing along
[Chorus]
Teach me the sound that can take me away
Play it again and again until I find rapture
It nevеr really ends
Teach mе the sound that can take me away
Play it again and again until I find rapture
Until the bitter end
[Verse 2]
At twenty-nine
I didn't see all the signs
So I hung on the line
'Til I lost my spine
I prayed to God
I could curb the black dog
Oh, the days are so long
With the oxygen gone
[Chorus]
Teach me the sound that can take me away
Play it again and again until I find rapture
It never really ends
Teach me the sound that can take me away
Play it again and again until I find rapture
Until the bitter end
[Post-Chorus]
Rapture, rapture
Ever after, in the bitter end
[Bridge]
Guess what I learned
From every bridge that I burned
That your love should be earned
And the world will still turn
All that I want
Is to hear that one song
When the noises are gone
I'll be singing along
[Chorus]
Teach me the sound that can take me away
Play it again and again until I find rapture
It never really ends
Teach me the sound that can take me away
Play it again and again until I find rapture
Until the bitter end
[Outro]
Rapture, rapture
Ever after, in the bitter end
Finding rapture, rapture
Ever after, in the bitter end
Finding rapture
Ever after
Finding rapture
I need a rapture
