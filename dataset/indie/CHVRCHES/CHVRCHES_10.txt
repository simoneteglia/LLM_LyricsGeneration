[Verse 1]
Savour the taste
Savour the pain
I don't expect you to release me
Jumping the gun
Holding my tongue
I never ask you to forgive me
[Pre-Chorus]
And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
[Chorus]
(
Forever, forever, forever
)
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
(
Forever, forever, forever
) Oh, oh
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
) Oh, oh
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
[Verse 2]
Playing the part
Playing the game
I don't expect you to believe me
Missing the mark
We tear it apart
I never ask you why you need me
[Pre-Chorus]
And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
[Chorus]
(
Forever, forever, forever
)
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
(
Forever, forever, forever
) Oh, oh
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
) Oh, oh
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
[Bridge]
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe it's too much for you
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe I am just too much for you
[Chorus]
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
(
Forever, forever, forever
) Oh, oh
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
) Oh, oh
(
Forever, forever, forever, forever
)
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
