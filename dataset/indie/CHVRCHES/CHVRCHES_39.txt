[Verse 1]
Swallowing the seeds of sins we sewed into the ground
Keeping secrets until everything became a bit too loud
[Pre-Chorus]
I could wash it down (I could wash it down)
I could drown it out (I could drown it out)
By filling up the silence with an organ sound
And by writing sentences I used to think were quite profound
[Chorus]
And it feels like the weight is too much to carry
I should quit, maybe go get married
Only time will tell
And I wonder if I should've changed my accent
Tried to make myself more attractive
Only time will tell
[Post-Chorus]
In the final cut (In the final cut)
In the final scene (In the final scene)
There's a final girl (There's a final girl)
And you know that she should be screaming
[Verse 2]
Telling all the tales took time that I just do not have
Sifting further through the wreckage, I think you just have to laugh
[Pre-Chorus]
Try to take it back (Try to take it back)
As it turns to black (As it turns to black)
Don't want to find your daughter in a body bag
So I need to get out now while most of me is still intact
[Chorus]
And it feels like the weight is too much to carry
I should quit, maybe go get married
Only time will tell
And I wonder if I should've changed my accent
Tried to make myself more attractive
Only time will tell
[Outro]
In the final cut (In the final cut)
In the final scene (In the final scene)
There's a final girl (There's a final girl)
Does she look like me? (Does she look like me?)
In the final cut (In the final cut)
In the final scene (In the final scene)
There's a final girl (There's a final girl)
And you know that she should be screaming now
