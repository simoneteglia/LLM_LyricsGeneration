[Verse 1]
You had better run from me
'Cause I am gonna come for you
I am gonna break you down
I never believed, but I see it now
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you see another picture?
There's no other way, never run far
Finally, we agree
You better run, you better run so
[Chorus]
Hide, hide
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
[Verse 2]
Who are you to tell me how
I treaded water all the while
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you see another lifetime?
There's no other way
Take a good swing at me
Finally, we agree
You better run, you better run so
[Chorus]
Hide, hide
Now I'll be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
[Post-Chorus]
Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
And it's you I'll come for
[Interlude]
And it's you I'll come for
[Outro]
Hide, hide
Hide, hide
Hide, hide
Hide, hide
