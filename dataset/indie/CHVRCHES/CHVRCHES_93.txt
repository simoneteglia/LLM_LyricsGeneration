[Verse 1]
Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-o-oh
And we've come as far as we’re ever gonna get
Until you realise, that you should go-o-o-oh
[Chorus]
Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling
[Verse 2]
In the dying light, I’m the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh
'Cause if I told the truth, I would always be free
And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-o-oh
[Chorus]
Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling
[Bridge]
Into the night, for once, we’re the only ones left
I bet you even know, where we could go-o-o-oh
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It’s a souvenir for when you go-o-o-oh
[Chorus]
Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart
[Chorus]
Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling
