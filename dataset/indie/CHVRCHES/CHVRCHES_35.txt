[Verse 1]
Careful when you're swimming in the holy water
Drowning in your own beliefs
Careful when you're standing at a broken altar
Asking if we feel relief
Careful when you're looking for a true confession
Mirror what you wanna see
Careful when you're telling us about obsession
Saying that we're never free
[Pre-Chorus]
You better hold on, hold on, hold on
You better hold on to what you love
You better give up, give up, give up
You better give up on giving up
[Chorus]
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you can never, never change?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you hurt me in exchange?
[Verse 2]
Trust me when I tell you 'bout my own convictions
Made my mind up long ago
Trust me when I tell you it's a contradiction
Wishing that I didn't know
Trust me that I struggle with all your destruction
Screaming that I told you so
Trust me when I talk about the disillusion
Building up and letting go
[Pre-Chorus]
You better hold on, hold on, hold on
You better hold on to what you love
You better give up, give up, give up
You better give up on giving up
[Chorus]
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you can never, never change?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you hurt me in exchange?
[Bridge]
Look in my eyes when you say it, say it
Look in my eyes like you mean it, mean it
Look in my eyes when you say it, say it
Look in my eyes like you mean it
[Chorus]
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you can never, never change?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
If you hurt me in exchange?
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
(Look in my eyes when you say it, say it)
If you can never, never change
(Look in my eyes like you mean it, mean it)
Is it deliver-iver-iverance
(Look in my eyes when you say it, say it)
If you hurt me in exchange
(Look in my eyes like you mean it, mean it, mean it)
[Outro]
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
Like you mean it
