[Verse 1]
Light is all over us
Like it always was
Like it always was
Shaped, by the clearest blue
But it's not enough
It's not enough, not enough
[Chorus 1]
Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides, never quite learning why
You'll meet me, you'll meet me
You'll meet me halfway
Whenever I feel it coming on, you can be well aware
If ever I try to push away, you can just keep me there
So please say you'll meet me
Meet me half- meet me halfway
[Post-Chorus]
So please say you'll meet me
Meet me halfway
Shaped by clearest blue
[Verse 2]
Tied, to the shifting ground
Like it always was
Like it always was
You were the perfect storm
But it's not enough, it's not enough
Not enough, not enough
[Chorus 2]
Just another time that I go down, but you are keeping up
Holding to a hope you'll undermine, never to be reversed
Just another time I'm caught inside every open eye
Holding on tightly to the sides, never quite learning why
Whenever I feel it coming on, you can be well aware
If ever I try to push away, you can just keep me, tell me
Tell me, tell me you'll meet me
Tell me, tell me you'll keep me
Tell me, tell me you'll meet me
Will you meet me more than halfway up?
[Post-Chorus]
So please say you'll meet me
Meet me halfway
Shaped by clearest blue
