[Verse 1]
Maybe I
Could tell you that it's no big deal
Maybe I can aim this high
Or maybe I could eat my words
[Pre-Chorus]
Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same
Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same
[Chorus]
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that
you're all I see in the light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used to
[Verse 2]
Maybe you
Could tell 'em that you stayed the course
Maybe I could clear my view
Or maybe I should eat my words
[Pre-Chorus]
Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same
Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same
[Chorus]
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used to
And never do what I used to
[Bridge]
Keep you away from the down side of me
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
If I keep you away from the down side of me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
(Only if I could see)
You can wrap up your hopes and release them to me
(Only if I could see)
You can keep me a trick of the light that you see
(Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
You would be, you would be, you would be
[Chorus]
I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
All I see
And I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
(Not the same, not the same, you're not the same, not the same)
And never do what I used to
And never do what I used to
