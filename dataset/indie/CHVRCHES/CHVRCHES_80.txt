[Verse 1]
White on white translucent black capes
Back on the rack
Bela Lugosi's dead
The bats have left the bell tower
The victims have been bled
Red velvet lines the black box
[Chorus]
Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Bela Lugosi's dead
[Verse 1]
The virginal brides file past his tomb
Strewn with time's dead flowers
Bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a darkened room
The count
[Chorus]
Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
[Outro]
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
Undead undead undead
