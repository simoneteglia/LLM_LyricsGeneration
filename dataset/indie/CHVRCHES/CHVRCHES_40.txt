[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry]
Had a dream your father died
I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry
The second night, I dreamt you drowned
You couldn't fight, you were not found
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
And these violent delights
Keep creeping into my nights
And they're reading my rites
And I'll never sleep alone again
And these violent delights
Keep bleeding into the light
And I'll never be right
But they'll never sleep alone again when I'm gone
When I'm gone
[Verse 2: Lauren Mayberry]
A photograph will steal your soul
An epitaph won't make you whole
If I disappear, thеy'll say I killed myself
I nevеr feared for my own health
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
And these violent delights
Keep creeping into my nights
And they're reading my rites
And I'll never sleep alone again
And these violent delights
Keep bleeding into the light
And I'll never be right
But they'll never sleep alone again when I'm gone
When I'm gone
[Bridge: Martin Doherty]
I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it
I don't want to sleep alone, no
I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it
Never sleep alone again, no
I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it
I don't want to sleep alone, no
I don't want to see it, I don't want to see it
Never sleep alone again when I'm gone
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
And these violent delights
Keep creeping into my nights
And they're reading my rites
And I'll never sleep alone again
And these violent delights
Keep bleeding into the light
And I'll never be right
But they'll never sleep alone again when I'm gone
When I'm gone
Alone again when I'm gone
When I'm gone
