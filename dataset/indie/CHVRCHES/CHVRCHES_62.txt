[Verse 1]
Everything you say
Can be heard through the white noise
And we can never stay up in arms
Everything you want
Will be held close to my heart
And we will never stay up in arms
[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the landslide
To focus your eyes ahead
I'm keeping track and hoping
That you will follow instead
I'm waiting for the landslide
To focus your eyes ahead
I'm keeping track and hoping
That you will follow instead
[Verse 2]
Everything you love
Can be kept if it hits home
And we can never stay up in arms
Everything I learned
Will be held close to your heart
And we will never stay up in arms
[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the landslide
To focus your eyes ahead
I'm keeping track and hoping
That you will follow instead
I'm waiting for the landslide
To focus your eyes ahead
I'm keeping track and hoping
That you will follow instead
[Bridge]
Stay close, keep hold
Stay close, keep hold
[Chorus]
I'm waiting for the landslide
To focus your eyes ahead
I'm keeping track and hoping
That you will follow instead
I'm waiting for the landslide
To focus your eyes ahead
I'm keeping track and hoping
That you will follow instead
