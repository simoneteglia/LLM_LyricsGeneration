[Verse 1]
Another life, another story
She walked out, said I was boring
About 3 AM, that's when I called my friends
We hit the bar, sent myself flying
Shit I said I'm never trying
'Til the bitter end, but every now and then
I wonder what it feels like to be more than I am
[Chorus]
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, is he a winner yet?
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
[Post Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet
Ooh, ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet
[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna base my actions
On reactions or the things they say
And I don't wanna hit delete
On all the parts of me that they might hate
So now I'm laying in my bed
And I can't get out my head
It's all because, all because
[Chorus]
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, is he a winner yet?
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
[Post Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet
Ooh, ooh
[Bridge]
I sold my soul, and all I got
The likes from strangers, love on the internet
[Outro]
Ooh, drugs and the internet
Ooh, still hasn't hit him yet
Ooh, drugs and the internet
Ooh, drugs and the internet
