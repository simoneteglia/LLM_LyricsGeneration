[Verse 1]
Wasn't it gonna be fun and wasn't it gonna be new?
Wasn't it gonna be different and wasn't it gonna be true?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Weren't you gonna be sorry and weren't you gonna be pure?
Weren't we gonna be honest and weren't we gonna be more?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
[Pre-Chorus]
All you want is to play at playing God
But I'm falling in and falling out
All you need is to play at playing God
And I'm falling in and falling out
[Chorus]
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that
?
)
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever stop
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
[Verse 2]
Weren't you trying forgiveness and weren't you trying to stay?
Weren't you trying to look up and weren't you trying to pray?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
[Pre-Chorus]
All you want is to play at playing God
But I'm falling in and falling out
All you need is to play at playing God
And I'm falling in and falling out
[Chorus]
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever stop
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
Never, never, never ever
Never ever, ever say die
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
[Outro]
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
(
Didn't you say that? Didn't you say that?
)
