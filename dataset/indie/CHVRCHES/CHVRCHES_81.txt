[Verse 1]
I run away from you
In the haunted air, just follow me
And if you take my word
I wouldn't lie or practice to deceive
Come inside
And tell me what is real and what's a dream
I could see your face
In the midnight bell, please let me be
[Chorus]
Close the door, but let me in
I can see through your disguise
Be my healer
Hide inside
Be the reason for my fear
And the reason for my smile
I'm talking in my sleep
Right in front of me
[Verse 2]
There's a reason why
You couldn't share this hour of make-believe
But I could come around
And stay a million days and never leave
[Chorus]
Close the door, but let me in
I can see through your disguise
Be my healer
Hide inside
Be the reason for my fear
You're the reason for my smile
I'm talking in my sleep
Right in front of me
Close the door, but let me in
I can see through your disguise
Be my healer
Hide inside
Be the reason for my fear
You're the reason for my smile
I'm talking in my sleep
Right in front of me
[Outro]
Burning from the inside
Talking in my sleep, sleep
Burning from the inside
Talking in my sleep, sleep
Burning from the inside out
Talking in my sleep, sleep, sleep
Burning from the inside out
Talking in my sleep, sleep, sleep
Burning from the inside out
Talking in my sleep, sleep, sleep
Burning from the inside out
Talking in my sleep, sleep, sleep
Burning from the inside out
Talking in my sleep, sleep, sleep
