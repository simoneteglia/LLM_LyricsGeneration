[Verse 1]
I lost myself, my mental health
Yeah, on a broken carousel
Spun down to hell
How far we fell
Maybe just as well
The stones we throw, they told me so
Yeah, it was death by stereo
When they dealt the final blow
Nowhere to go
[Chorus]
I turned into a killer, I'm insane
I'll cry you a river down the drain
Are you entertained?
[Verse 2]
No one to call in my downfall
Yeah, in the
valley of the dolls
I was climbing up the walls
No light at all
[Chorus]
I turned into a killеr, I'm insane
I'll cry you a river down the drain
I turnеd into a killer, played the game
Don't look in the mirror, feel the pain
Are you entertained?
[Outro]
I turned into a killer, I'm insane
I'll cry you a river down the drain
Are you entertained?
