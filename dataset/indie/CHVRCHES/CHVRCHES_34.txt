[Verse 1]
All of the black and white
All of the contours
Are laid out before me now
To leave a trace
With all of the light and shade
We take up our own space
I'll find my own way back
Back to the past tense
[Chorus]
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side and I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side and I should know
[Verse 2]
All of the empty thoughts
All of the outlines
Are laid out before us now
To leave a trace
All of your words and mine
They keep returning
I'll find my own way back
Back to the silence
[Chorus]
A lifeline to highs and lows
To seeing the bright side and I should know
We wait for the afterglow
To cover the blind side and I should know
[Outro]
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
I've given up all I can
