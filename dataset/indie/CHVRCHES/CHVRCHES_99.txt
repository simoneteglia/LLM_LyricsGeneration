[Verse 1]
You had better run from me
With everything you own
'Cause I am gonna come for you
With all that I have
I am gonna break you down
To tiny, tiny parts
I never believed, but I see it now
I'm learning your lesson, I'm learning your lesson
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you wear it on your sleeve?
Did you see another picture
Where I was not a part so far entwined?
There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so
[Chorus]
Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun
[Verse 2]
Who are you to tell me how
To keep myself afloat
I treaded water all the while
You stuck in the knife that you held at my back
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Did it make you feel so clever?
Did you wear it on your sleeve?
Did you see another lifetime
Where I was not a part so far entwined?
There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so
[Chorus]
Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
Now I'll be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun
[Bridge]
There's no other way, never run far
Take a good swing at me and everything is even
So finally, we agree: no place for promises here
You better run, you better run so
[Chorus]
Hide, hide, I have burned your bridges
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
Hide, hide, now it's all so easy
I will be a gun and it's you I'll come for
[Outro]
And it's you I'll come for
And it's you I'll come for
And it's you I'll come for
And it's you I'll come for
And it's you
And I'm gonna see that you won't go far
And I'm gonna see that you won't go far
And I'm gonna see that you won't go far
And I'm gonna see that you won't go far
