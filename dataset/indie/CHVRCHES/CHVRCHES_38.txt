[Verse 1]
I hear it
Echoing of every place that we call our home
And I don't talk
Of any time I ever believed in the unknown
I need it
So I hold onto every mistake that I made alone
And I don't lie
When I say that we will never return to closing doors
[Chorus 1]
Sleep tight in a new light
Through another warning call
Look down on the cold ground
I will try to break the fall
[Verse 2]
I feel it
Moving in another direction we call our own
And I won't chase
Anyone who ever believed in what they stole
I need it
So I hold onto every peace of mind that I chose
And I don't lie
When I say that we will never return to closing doors
[Chorus 1]
Sleep tight in a new light
Through another warning call
Look down on the cold ground
I will try to break the fall
[Chorus 2]
Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide
Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide
[Bridge]
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
Don't look away 'cause when we see it we are closer
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
Don't look away 'cause when we see it we are near
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
[Chorus 2]
Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide
Say you'll remember
To keep it all inside
You can run for the skyline
Your eyes open wide
[Outro]
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
(It's a memory, it's a memory)
