[Verse]
You belong with me
I'm tracing a line
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
You collapse in threes
Show me inside
Wasted and wide like dead sand
You confide in me
Shamed and maligned
Shaped and defined by God's plan
You belong to me
You're crossing a line
You're cold and confined, you're no friend
[Chorus]
I wait for a sign
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
Of your hand
Of your hand
What's yours can be mine
I'm tracing the lines of your hand
Of your hand
Of your hand
[Outro]
You belong with me
And tonight, at least we can die in silence
Is it worth it now?
Tell me, is it worth it now?
Is it worth it now?
