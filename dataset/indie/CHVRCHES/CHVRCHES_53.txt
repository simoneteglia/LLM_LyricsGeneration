[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry]
Cover up, cover up
Cover up that you're ruthless
Nobody, nobody
Nobody's ever gonna notice
And I am catching up
And I am seeing red
How about I prove I'm right
And raise it overhead?
[Pre-Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
I never promised you
Anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me
You would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry & Hayley Williams]
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
Reaching, reaching for
Reaching for my resistance
Nobody, nobody
Nobody sees it at a distance
And I am catching up
And I am seeing red
How about I throw my weight
And raise it overhead?
[Pre-Chorus: Hayley Williams]
I never promised you
Anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me
You would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry & Hayley Williams]
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus: Lauren Mayberry & Hayley Williams]
I never promised you
Anything I couldn't do
We try to bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
You never promised me
You would see it differently
Bury it and rise above
Bury it and rise above you, you
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry & Hayley Williams]
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
We bury it, bury it, bury it
And rise above
