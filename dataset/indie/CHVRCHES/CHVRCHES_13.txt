[Verse 1]
I'm writing to ask you, did you achieve all you wanted to do?
Before we were dragged up, something was different and nothing was new
How did you see me? We didn't know what we wanted to be
When did we move on? I didn't feel it, nobody told me
[Pre-Chorus]
Time to kill
Was always an illusion
Time stood still
And now we never will, never will
[Chorus]
We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
[Verse 2]
Standing in streetlights, we didn't know wrong, didn't know right
Making a mess and running in circles, getting in fights
We were just kids then, we didn't know how and didn't know when
Taking our chances, calling it off and starting again
[Pre-Chorus]
Time to kill
Was always an illusion
Time stood still
And now we never will, never will
[Chorus]
We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
[Bridge]
Never will
Never will
[Chorus]
We wrote our names along the bathroom walls
Graffitiing our hearts across the stalls
I've been waiting for my whole life to grow old
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
And now we never will, never will
