[Verse 1]
Lap of light
Cover the way and keep my side
Or steal away from me
And keep a tight lip in secret silence
Eyes like mine
Watching you blow us all to hell
But if you took our lives
There would be no one to tell your story
[Chorus]
And how can I make you understand?
Lying with you, I held your hand
"Never look down", I heard you say
But it's over and I just can't believe I'm wrong
How can I make you understand?
Lying with you, I held your hand
"Never look down", I heard you say
But it's over and I knew it was all along
[Verse 2]
Wild like time
Why can't you believe or just abidе
The way I tell you so?
I stop the day for onе simple sideshow
Seasons smile
And we were unable to stay warm
But in the darkest night
And there's an ember that's always burning
[Chorus]
And how can I make you understand?
Lying with you, I held your hand
"Never look down", I heard you say
But it's over and I just can't believe I'm wrong
How can I make you understand?
Lying with you, I held your hand
"Never look down", I heard you say
But it's over and I knew it was all along
