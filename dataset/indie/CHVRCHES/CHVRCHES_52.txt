[Verse 1]
So, I think it's time
To face yourself again
It's not too late
It's always time
So steal yourself
What are you looking for?
We both are free
In the here and now
So take my hand
And don't fear what you find
On your own
Open up give it up, go!
[Chorus]
Your life will be brighter
Your days will be longer
Become what you're feeling
Flesh and blood
Give it up, go!
It's only illusion
A miracle dawning
Give into the knowing
Flesh and blood
Give it up, go!
[Verse 2]
Truth is just as real
As your dream allow
It's far away
It's all around
Forget yourself
Cast aside regret
It starts, it ends
Open up
Give it up, go!
[Chorus x2]
