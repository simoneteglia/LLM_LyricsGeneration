[Verse 1]
I gave up on time
Just like you said you would
There are tiny cracks of light underneath me
And you say I got it wrong
But I try hard to uncover them
I have somehow got
Away with everything
Anything you ever did was strictly by design
But you got it wrong
And I'll go anywhere but there
[Pre-Chorus]
And you had best believe
That you cannot build what I don't need
And I know I need to feel relief
And I know you'll never fold
But I believe nothing that I'm told
And I know I need to feel relief
[Chorus]
I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man
[Verse 2]
I will show restraint
Just like we said we should
You think I'll apologise for things I left behind
But you got it wrong
And I'm as sane as I ever was
You talk far too much
For someone so unkind
I will wipe the salt off of my skin
And I'll admit that I got it wrong
And there is grey between the lines
[Pre-Chorus]
And you had best believe
That you cannot build what I don't need
And I know I need to feel relief
And I know you'll never fold
But I believe nothing that I'm told
And I know I need to feel relief
[Chorus]
I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man
[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
[Chorus]
I know I need to feel released
Take care to tell it just as it was
Take care to tell on me for the cause
I know I need to feel released
Take care to bury all that you can
Take care to leave a trace of a man
[Outro]
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I need
