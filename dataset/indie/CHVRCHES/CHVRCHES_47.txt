[Verse 1: Martin Doherty]
I hear you when you call
There's a sign for her and everyone
And go on, but not with me
And let it all fall down
Let it all fall down
[Chorus: Martin Doherty]
Sky is light
You caught the light
You carried mine
You caught the light
[Verse 2: Martin Doherty]
They said that you would call
And take it all, it's history
And we'll laugh until the end
Let the rain come down
Let it all come down
[Chorus: Martin Doherty &
Lauren Mayberry
]
Sky is light
(
I have nothing but love for
)
You caught the light
(
The places that call me home
)
You carried mine
(
I have nothing but love for
)
You caught the light
(
The places that call me home
)
[Chorus: Martin Doherty &
Lauren Mayberry
]
Sky is light
(
I have nothing but love for
)
You caught the light
(
The places that call me home
)
You carried mine
(
I have nothing but love for
)
You caught the light
(
The places that call me home
)
