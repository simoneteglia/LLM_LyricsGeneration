[Tegan and Sara cover]
[Verse 1]
I won't regret saying this
This thing that I'm saying
Is it better than keeping my mouth shut?
That goes without saying
[Pre-Chorus]
Call, break it off
Call, break my own heart
[Chorus]
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at
But now we'll never know
I won't be sad
But in case, I'll go there everyday
To make myself feel bad
There's a chance I'll start to wonder
If this was the thing to do
[Verse 2]
I won't be out long
But I still think it's better if
You take your time coming over here
I think that's for the best
[Pre-Chorus]
Call, break it off
Call, break my own heart
[Chorus]
Maybe I would have been something you'd be good at
Maybe you would have been something I'd be good at
But now we'll never know
I won't be sad
But in case, I'll go there everyday
To make myself feel bad
There's a chance I'll start to wonder
If this was the thing to do
I'll start to wonder
If this was the thing to do
I'll start to wonder
If this was the thing to do
