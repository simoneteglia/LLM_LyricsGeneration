[Verse 1]
No more barricades, slowly diffusing
I'll be leaving now, nobody's losing
If you could play your part, stay in resistance
Every fault would fade into the distance
[Pre-Chorus]
Run if you like
All the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over
[Chorus]
And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
[Verse 2]
No more clarity, only confusion
Every focused thought just an illusion
If I could see you now, if you would listen
Every fault would fade into the distance
[Pre-Chorus]
Run if you like
All the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over
[Chorus]
And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
[Bridge]
And you are
If I only hadn't given you up
If you only hadn't given me up
And you are
If I only hadn't given you up
Losin' my breath and leavin' the rest
[Pre-Chorus]
Run if you like
All the mistakes that you left behind
Hold me down
You can't deny and I can't deny
Open your eyes
I'll look away and you come around
To build your words
High enough to carry you over
[Chorus]
And I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up, me up
Then I never would've given you up
Never would've given you up, you up
If you only hadn't given me up
Only hadn't given me up
