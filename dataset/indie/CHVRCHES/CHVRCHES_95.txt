[Intro]
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
[Verse 1]
Caught out, cold
Hiding from you in a skin so old (old)
I'll come clean
Everyone, everyone knows it's me (me)
[Verse 2]
Caught out, cold
Hiding from you in a skin so old (old)
I'll come clean
Everyone, everyone knows it's me (me)
[Verse 3]
Blow by blow
Honest in every way I know (know)
You appear
To face the decision I know you fear
[Pre-Chorus 1]
If I recover
Pick any number
If I recover
Pick any number
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I recover
Will you be my comfort
Pick any number
Choose any colour
[Chorus]
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
[Interlude]
[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I recover
Will you be my comfort
Pick any number
Choose any colour
[Pre-Chorus 3]
If I recover
Will you be my comfort
Or it can be over
Choose any colour
[Chorus]
I'll give you one more chance to say
We can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
I'll give you one more chance say
We can change our old ways
And you take what you need
And you know you don't
[Post-Chorus]
I'll give you one more chance
And you take what you need
I'll give you one more chance
And you take what you need
And you know you don't need me
[Outro]
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
"The last one was a bit tuney..."
