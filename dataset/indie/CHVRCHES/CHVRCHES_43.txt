[Verse 1]
I can barely see you when I close my eyes
There's nothing left of you here
We had the time, we had the time
Things that we remember and do not regret
They don't mean a thing here
We had the time, we had the time
[Chorus]
I'll be your guide so you can see
The other side and I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head so you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping to never let you get away
Never let you get away
[Verse 2]
Everything you prayed for is not overhead
No one else will save you
Make up your mind, make up your mind
Trust me when I tell you we are on our own
Overlap our fingers
And run to ground, weâ€™ll run to ground
[Chorus]
I'll be your guide so you can see
The other side and I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head so you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping to never let you get away
Never let you get away
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
I'll be your guide so you can see
The other side and I will never let you get away
Never let you get away
I'll hold your head so you can see
Crossing your heart and hoping to never let you get away
Never let you get away
[Outro]
Never let you get away
Never let you get away
Never let you get away
