[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry]
I'm writin' a book on how to stay conscious when you drown
And if the words float up to the surface, I'll keep 'em down
This is the first time I know I don't want the crown
You can take it now
You promised the world and brought me it hangin' from a string
Stuck it in my mouth, into my throat, told me to sing
That was the first time I knew you can't kill the king
And those who kiss the ring
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
Tell me how
It's better when the sun goes down
We will never escape this town
I wasn't scared when he caught me, look what it taught me
Tell me how
It's better if I make no sound
I will never escape these doubts
I wasn't dead when they found me, watch as they pull me down
[Verse 2: Robert Smith]
I'm writing a chapter on what to do after they dig you up
On what to do after you grew to hate what you used to love
That was the first time I knew they were out for blood
And they would have your guts
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry & Robert Smith]
Tell me how
It's better when the sun goes down
We will never escape this town
I wasn't scared when he caught me, look what it taught me
Tell me how
It's better if I make no sound
I will never escape these doubts
I wasn't dead when they found me, watch as they pull me down
[Bridge: Lauren Mayberry & Robert Smith]
Watch as they pull me down
Watch as they pull me down
Pulling me down
Dead when they found me, watch as they pull me down
Watch as they pull me down
Watch as they pull me down
Pulling me down
Dead when they found me, watch as they pull me down
[Outro: Robert Smith]
I'm writing a book on how to stay conscious when you drown
And if the words float up to the surface, I'll keep them down
This is the first time I know I don't want the crown
You can take it now (You can take it now)
You can take it now (You can take it now)
Take it now (Take it now)
