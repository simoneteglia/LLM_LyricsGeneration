[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
He said, "You bore me to death"
"I know you heard me the first time"
and
"Be sad, but don't be depressed"
Just think it over, over and
He said, "It's all in your head"
"But keep an ear to the grapevine" and
"Get drunk, but don't be a mess"
Keep thinking over, over
[Pre-Chorus]
I try
But it's hard to hit rewind
When I feel like
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Over and over, I
Feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Over and over, I try
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
He said, "You need to be fеd"
"But keep an eye on your waistline"
and
"Look good, but don't bе obsessed"
Keep thinking over, over
[Pre-Chorus]
I try
But it's hard to know what's right
When I feel like I'm borrowing all of my time
And it's hard to hit rewind
When I feel like
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Over and over, I
Feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Over and over, I (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Over and over, I
Feel like I'm losing my mind (Feel like I'm losing my mind)
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Over and over, I try
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
