[Verse 1]
Throw me
No more bones and I will tell you no lies
This time
At least I am not
So cold
You give me everything I never deserved
This time
You know I'll leave
[Chorus]
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never-ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
[Verse 2]
Cut off
I'll go my way if I'm going at all
This time
Believe that the strong
Red lines
That I will draw will come and cover you up
This time
You know I'll leave
[Chorus]
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never-ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
[Bridge]
We are losing ground
It's time to save your neck
And I will try to find my feet and go
I am braced for words that never come
But I choose to decide
That I don't regret it, I don't regret it
[Chorus]
Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
Here's to never-ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another, say you need another
