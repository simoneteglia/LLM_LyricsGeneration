[Verse 1]
Faster, faster, you won't go far
Shouldn't leave, feeling faint, we both know why
You got to show me both knees, cold, I lie
Hold me slowly, hide me till I can fight
Always, we can sing, we can make time
Old songs, flood and flame, you could be mine
But you got to show me both knees, skin and bone
Clothe me, throw me, move me till
[Chorus]
I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
If I feel alone
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know, like I know what you want
[Verse 2]
Icon of symmetry, swallowing sides
Fall down in front of me, follow my eyes
But I've got to see you moving, waste no time
Teach me, make me holy till
[Chorus]
I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
If I feel alone
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know, like I know what you want
[Bridge]
Anyone, anyone, anyone
Anyone, anyone, anyone
Like I know, like I know what you want
Like I know, like I know what you want
[Chorus]
I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
If I feel alone
I can feed your dirty mind
Like I know, like I know what you want
