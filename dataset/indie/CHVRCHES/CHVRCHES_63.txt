[Verse 1]
Am I the deer?
Am I the headlights?
I know that I can't slow down
Everything fractures in the light
And I stand by watching it burn
[Pre-Chorus]
And I used to laugh at the broken glass
I should probably paper over all the cracks
Took a photograph of the aftermath
I should probably look less fondly on the past
[Chorus]
Silent screaming at the ceiling
Wondering when I lost heart
And time's been stealing all my dreams
And I no longer look the part
[Post-Chorus]
And I used to laugh at the broken glass
I should probably paper over all the cracks
Took a photograph of the aftermath
I should probably look less fondly on the past
[Verse 2]
Am I the butcher?
Am I the knife?
If I don't know what all this is for?
I used to read myself to death
But I don't see the point anymore
[Chorus]
Silent screaming at the ceiling
Wondering when I lost heart
And time's been stealing all my dreams
And I no longer look the part
[Post-Chorus]
And you used to laugh at the broken glass
I should probably paper over all the cracks
Took a photograph of the aftermath
I should probably look less fondly on the past
On the past
[Outro]
Am I the deer?
Am I the headlights?
I know that I can't slow down
