[Verse 1]
Talked ourselves to death
Never saying what I wanted
Saying what I needed
I pushed you to the edge
Never knowing what I wanted
Knowing what I needed you to say
[Pre-Chorus]
Reflections you used to see
Never look alike to me
[Chorus]
Get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
[Post-Chorus]
Good intentions, never good enough
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
[Verse 2]
Going out my mind
Never getting what I wanted
Getting what I needed
I left myself behind
Never knowing what I wanted
Knowing what I needed you to do
[Pre-Chorus]
The reflections you used to see
Never look alike to me
[Chorus]
Get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
[Post-Chorus]
Good intentions, never good enough
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
[Bridge]
So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope
So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope, oh
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
[Post-Chorus]
Good intentions, never good enough
Can we get out, get out
Get, get, get out
Get, get, get out of here?
[Bridge]
So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope
So do you want to turn it around?
And do you want to show me how?
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope, oh
[Outro]
You are a kaleidoscope
You are a kaleidoscope
