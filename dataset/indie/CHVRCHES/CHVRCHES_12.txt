[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry]
How long till you leave it?
You should know that we're alone this time
Keep yourself a secret, you should know that
I will sell you a future you don't want
Like I did last time
I won't go slow
All the things you tell yourself
Offer no resolution
[Verse 2: Lauren Mayberry]
You know that this will break us
But you push as far as we can go
Taking every chance to find solutions
That never make anyone happy
We are done this time
You don't owe me
Take a final look at me
Take it, and drink it in
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything you give me
Till the time we let go
Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything you give me
Till the time we let go
[Verse 3: Lauren Mayberry]
Keep me in your eyeline
Keep believing what you said before
I will change direction
I will tell you that everything's moving too slowly
Just another lie
One more untruth
You won't ever see through me
You will still drink it in
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
Breathe through me
Fill up your lungs with us
I will keep everything you give me
Till the time we let go
[Outro: Lauren Mayberry,
Martin Doherty
]
Breathe through me
(
You know that this will break us
But you push as far as we can go
)
Fill up your lungs with us
(
Taking every chance to find solutions
That never make anyone happy
)
I will keep everything
(
We are done this time
You don't owe me
)
You give me
(
Take a final look at me
)
Till the time
(
Take it
)
We let go
