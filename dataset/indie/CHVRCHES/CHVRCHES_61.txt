[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry]
Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out, but you came home around three
Now if six of ya'll went out, then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner, I found your credit card receipt
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your keys
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
[Verse 2: Lauren Mayberry]
I'll pack your bags so you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings and then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me?
You said it was one of your friends down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID?
[Bridge: Lauren Mayberry &
Martin Doherty

(
Oh, I've been through all this before
)
I've been through all this before
(
So how could you think
)
Don't think about it, don't think about it
(
That I would stand around and take some more
)
Get gone, get gone
(
Things are gonna change
)
Things are gonna change, baby
(
'Cause I don't want to be a fool anymore
)
You don't stand a chance, boy
(
That's why you have to leave
)
You don't stand a chance
(
So don't turn around to see my face
)
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see
[Verse 3: Lauren Mayberry]
Was it really worth you going out like that?
See, I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back
See, all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out you were making a fool of me
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your keys
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your keys
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
