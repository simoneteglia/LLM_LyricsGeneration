[Verse 1]
I will never believe what they say
There is a strength in enduring
They never speak for themselves
We are disappearing
[Pre-Chorus]
You will be all that I seek in a twisted light
I would live inside you
Words will be all that I keep in an open space
They would live inside you
[Chorus]
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
[Post-Chorus]
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
[Verse 2]
This is a call to your arms
To take on mind over matter
Replacing fist over fist
We are disappearing
[Pre-Chorus]
You will be all that I seek in a twisted light
I would live inside you
Words will be all that I keep in an open space
They would live inside you
[Chorus]
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
We hold up to an idea
And we'll fight it, what we can't see
We just hold up to an idea
We keep going 'til we can't hear dead air
[Post-Chorus]
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
We are, we are, we are all just dead air
