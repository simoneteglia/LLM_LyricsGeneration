[Verse 1]
I am talking in my sleep
Hiding inside my dreams
Fighting inside my head
Scaring myself to death
We live in a wonderland
Like blood isn't on our hands
When will it be enough?
[Pre-Chorus]
When will I say I knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away from the storm?
[Chorus]
Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
You tell me that we'll be alright, but I don't know if you're right
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds
[Verse 2]
I am counting every sheep
But these rabbit holes run deep
Trying to be so right
Desperate to start a fight
All of this pointless talk
Why can't I turn it off?
When will it all just stop?
[Pre-Chorus]
When will I say I knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away
Knew we had to get away all along?
[Chorus]
Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
You tell me that we'll be alright, but I don't know if you're right
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Can't live forever with my head in the clouds
Can't predict the weather with my feet on the ground
You tell me that we'll be alright, but I don't know if you're right
I can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds
