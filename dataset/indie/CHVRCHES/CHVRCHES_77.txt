[Verse 1]
So I couldn't just go
Leave this city on fire
Last time, looked in your eyes
Saw your face change
What were you thinking?
Last night wasn't enough
Thought I knew what you wanted
Painful things
Far from real
You're all that I wanted
[Chorus]
You and I will burn this down
You and I next time around
You and I will burn this down
You and I must turn around
[Verse 2]
Can't sleep, burning inside
Will I suffer in violence?
Broken smile
I lie here just waiting to hold you
[Chorus]
You and I will burn this down
You and I must turn around
You and I will burn this down
You and I must turn around
[Outro]
You and I will burn this down
You and I must turn around
