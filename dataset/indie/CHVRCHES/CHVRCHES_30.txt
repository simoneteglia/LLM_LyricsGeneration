[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry,
Martin Doherty & Iain Cook
]
Bad blood and no holds barred
A warning shot
, a sacrifice that we made
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
Waste of time or waste of fear
Do it again, again till you unfocus them away
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry,
Martin Doherty & Iain Cook
]
All that's golden
Is never real
And I won't play fair
With you this time
All that's golden
Is never so
And I'll be thankful
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
When you let go
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
[Verse 2: Lauren Mayberry,
Martin Doherty & Iain Cook
]
With teeth, we've come this far
I'll take
this thing by the throat
and walk away
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
Remember me as I will you
Honesty will wreck this home that we made
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry,
Martin Doherty & Iain Cook
]
All that's golden
Is never real
And I won't play fair
With you this time
All that's golden
Is never so
And I'll be thankful
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
When you let go
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
[Bridge: Lauren Mayberry]
Taking over parts of mine
That I will pay for every time
If I could catch you and cut your ties
I would leave you every time
[Chorus: Lauren Mayberry,
Martin Doherty & Iain Cook
]
All that's golden
Is never real
And I won't play fair
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
With you this time
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
All that's golden
Is never so
And I'll be thankful
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
When you let go
(
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
)
[Outro: Martin Doherty & Iain Cook]
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
You know, you know, you know, you know that you go too far
