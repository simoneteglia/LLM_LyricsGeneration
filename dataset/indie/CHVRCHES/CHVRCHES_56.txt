[Verse 1]
Catch them and kill them
Your only hope is evil
I will not die, I will keep quiet
I will hold you high above
[Refrain]
You're on your own
Wait till dawn and then go
[Verse 2]
No help here from heaven
You're not as real as I am
I will wake at the dark hours
Until your blood is out
[Chorus]
You're on your own
I'm lying in here
Inside your sleep
Keep yourself
Awake for this
Wait till dawn and then go
[Verse 3]
Our love will never die
Broken bones and promises
Your weakness is clear now
I see your kind eyes
[Refrain]
You're on your own
Wait till dawn and then go
[Verse 4]
You are another one
Buried here by no one
I will keep you inside
With your soul alive
[Chorus]
You're on your own
Keep your head
Beneath your hands
Play your part
All on your own
Closed and bruised
You're on your own
