[Verse]
Draw a line in the sand
Like there's nothing to regret and nothing to prove (prove, prove)
Set my sights high enough
So I see the turning tides are parting for you

[Bridge]
If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tide
They're spilling over me, filling my insides
If we wanna stay here, can we see the waves?
They're spilling over us, filling our insides
In the rising water, in the rising tide
We wait for the fall
