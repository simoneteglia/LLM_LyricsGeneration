[Verse 1]
Breathe, don't speak
It's leaving your body now
Slow heart, set free
A circuit of consciousness
When you are truly yourself
You will succumb to a permanence
A light, by day
A shadow resides by night
[Refrain]
I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing
I, I
Feel, feel
You, you
Leaving
[Chorus]
With understanding
You won't let it cast you down
A mind full of questions
A current to purify
Science and visions
Be near when I call your name
Or ask me a question
[Refrain]
I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing
[Verse 2]
Breathe, don't speak
It's leaving your body now
[Refrain]
I, I
Feel, feel
You, you
Leaving
[Verse 3]
Heart set free
A circuit of consciousness
[Refrain]
I, I
Hear, hear
Your, your
Breathing
[Verse 4]
Light by day
A shadow resides by night
[Refrain]
I, I
Feel, feel
You, you
Leaving
[Chorus]
With understanding
You won't let it cast you down
A mind full of questions
A current to purify
Science and Visions
Be near when I call your name
A mind full of questions
A current to purify
Science and vision
Be near when I call your name
Or ask me a question
