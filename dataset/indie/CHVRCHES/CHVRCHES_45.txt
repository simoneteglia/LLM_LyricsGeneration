[Verse 1]
Hoping for the pin to drop
'Cause I can't hold it all
Trying to correct the wrongs
Say when, say when
Better luck now that you're on your own
So don't just lie there
Hoping for the pin to drop
Say when, say when
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep counting all the fresh starts we had
I'll raise another white flag so that
We keep counting all the fresh starts we had
I'll fly another white flag over us
[Chorus]
No time to bow down, no time to kill
No justifying staying down in silence
No time to bow down, no time to kill
We stay between the white lines
No time to bow down, no time to kill
No justifying staying down in silence
No time to bow down, no time to kill
We stay between the white lines
[Verse 2]
Hoping for a stroke of luck
But one you're counting on
Trying to deflect away
Say when, say when
What do you have, and what do you want?
Are you still stuck here
Hoping for a stroke of luck?
Say when, say when
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll raise another white flag so that
We keep counting all the fresh starts we've had
I'll fly another white flag over us
[Chorus]
No time to bow down, no time to kill
No justifying staying down in silence
No time to bow down, no time to kill
We stay between the white lines
No time to bow down, no time to kill
No justifying staying down in silence
No time to bow down, no time to kill
We stay between the white lines
[Bridge]
Changing focus, stay in silence
Changing focus, stay in silence
(Changing focus, stay in silence)
No time to bow down, no time to kill
No justifying staying down in silence
(Changing focus, stay in silence)
No time to bow down, no time to kill
We stay between the white lines
[Chorus]
No time to bow down, no time to kill
No justifying staying down in silence
No time to bow down, no time to kill
We stay between the white lines
No time to bow down, no time to kill
No justifying staying down in silence
No time to bow down, no time to kill
We stay between the white lines
[Outro]
The white lines
Between the white lines
White lines
