[Verse 1: Lauren Mayberry]
Vicious one, how ever did you find me?
Time is wasted, words are cheap
Now it seems that we are not crazy
And lovers sow what lovers reap
[Pre-Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
Nothing now can ever come between us
As we hide and watch the city burn
There is much that I still want to tell you
But now is not the time to speak of love
[Chorus: Martin Doherty & (Lauren Mayberry)]
(Oh, oh) Echo into me
(I, I) More than memory
(Oh, oh) Words are useless here
(I, I) Until you are near
[Verse 2: Lauren Mayberry]
Love and fear, I cannot be your savior
There is no violence in your heart
Warriors are both time and patience
But you and I are worlds apart
[Bridge: Lauren Mayberry]
We all, we all, we all saw the light
We are, we are, we are first and right
[Pre-Chorus: Lauren Mayberry]
Nothing now can ever come between us
As we hide and watch the city burn
There is much that I still want to tell you
But now is not the time to speak of love
[Chorus: Martin Doherty & (Lauren Mayberry)]
(Oh, oh) Echo into me
(I, I) More than memory
(Oh, oh) Words are useless here
(I, I) Until you are near
(Oh, oh) Echo into me
(I, I) More than memory
(Oh, oh) Words are useless here
(I, I) Until you are near
