[Verse 1]
I've lost my appetite
Drinking the pesticide
Thinking that it's not a suicide if we act polite
Jesus Christ
I'm getting tired of the alibis
All the excuses and reasons why build inside my mind
No reply
I wish that I'd known ahead of time
And I wish I had been more kind
I wish I
[Chorus]
Paralysed and spinning backwards
Lullabies don't comfort me
Televise the great disaster
We're better off inside of the screen
I'm terrified of falling faster
Lullabies don't comfort me
So televise the great disaster
We're better off inside of the screen sometimes
[Verse 2]
I'm lying on the floor
What are we waiting for?
I'm getting tired of trying so hard to be adored
Close the door
Wish I'd reached out to my mother more
Wish that I hadn't kept the score
I wish I
[Chorus]
Paralysed and spinning backwards
Lullabies don't comfort me
Televise the great disaster
We're better off inside of the screen
I'm terrified of falling faster
Lullabies don't comfort me
So televise the great disaster
We're better off inside of the screen sometimes
