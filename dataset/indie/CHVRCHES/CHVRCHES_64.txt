[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just drive
Till the night turns off my mind
I'm passing cars and crowded bars
Never know until I go too far
Confusing faith and fear
Paint a smile from ear to ear
'Cause if I blink, I start to think
I feel nothing, I feel everything
[Pre-Chorus]
I try my best to turn down the noise
And I tell myself that boys will be boys
It's gettin' harder to breathe
So, baby, put me to sleep
Till it gets better
[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over (Over)
It's over (Over)
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'll believe it (Ha)
[Verse 2]
Keep me in the dark
Then fast-forward to the part
With endless nights and neon lights
I'll be beautiful and starry-eyed
[Pre-Chorus]
I try my best to turn down the noise
And I tell myself that boys will be boys
It's gettin' harder to breathe
So, baby, put me to sleep
Till it gets better
[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over (Over)
It's over (Over)
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'll believe it (Ha)
[Bridge]
Sometimes I just drive
When I can't turn off my mind
I don't know where, I'll meet you there someday
[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over (Over)
It's over (Over)
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'll believe it (Ha)
