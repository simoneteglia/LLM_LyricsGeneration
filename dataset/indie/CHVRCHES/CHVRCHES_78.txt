[Verse 1]
Am I real if you can see right through me?
If I'm in a magazine
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
[Verse 2]
Am I real if I'm a broken record?
Selling you what you don't need
Do you believe it? Do you believe?
Do you believe it? I don't
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you ever wonder what we learned?
We can raise our glasses
Dancing on the ashes
As it burns
Have you reached the point of no return?
We can raise our glasses
Dancing on the ashes
As it burns
[Chorus]
Is this heaven or is this hell?
Through a silver screen
You're saying what you mean
But I can't tell
Is this heaven or is this hell?
If none of this is real
Then show me what you feel
'Cause I can't tell
[Verse 3]
Is it right if I'm a perfect actress
Playin' the princess in distress
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
[Verse 4]
Is it alright if I save myself and
If I clean up my own mess
Is it enough yet? Is it enough?
Is it enough yet? 'Cause I've had enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you ever wonder what we learned?
We can raise our glasses
Dancing on the ashes
As it burns
Have you reached the point of no return?
We can raise our glasses
Dancing on the ashes
As it burns
[Chorus]
Is this heaven or is this hell?
Through a silver screen
You're saying what you mean
But I can't tell
Is this heaven or is this hell?
If none of this is real
Then show me what you feel
'Cause I can't tell
[Chorus]
Is this heaven or is this hell?
Through a silver screen
You're saying what you mean
But I can't tell
Is this heaven or is this hell?
If none of this is real
Then show me what you feel
'Cause I can't tell
