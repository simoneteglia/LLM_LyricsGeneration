[Verse 1]
Take your time, watching over you
Waiting for a low I will take for you
Step-by-step I will shadow you
You can hold your own, I will hold it too
In your name, I will cover you
Waiting for the blame I will take for you
All I need is to carry you
You can hold your own, I will hold it too
[Chorus]
Only want what you know you need
I begin to see
I look into you and know what you're asking for
You want what you know you need
I begin to see
I look into you and follow you through the dark
[Verse 2]
Change your mind like you always do
Waiting for the blow I will take for you
Blinding lights washing over you
You can hold your own and I will hold it too
[Chorus]
Only want what you know you need
I begin to see
I look into you and know what you're asking for
You want what you know you need
I begin to see
I look into you and follow you through the dark
[Chorus]
Only want what you know you need
I begin to see
I look into you and know what you're asking for
You want what you know you need
I begin to see
I look into you and follow you through the dark
[Outro]
Through the dark, through the dark
Through the dark, through the dark
Through the dark
