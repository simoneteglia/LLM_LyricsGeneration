[Verse 1]
Me, I've come apart and you made me
Float like a pretty box of your evil
So tired, so easy,
I
Bleed out, what the fuck were you thinking?
We are gonna fall if you lead us
Nowhere, no wasted time
[Chorus]
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
[Verse 2]
Me, let me stop for a second
The held heart only beats in the evening
Low tide, watching full flight
I tell you to cut it out if you make me
You know why, the slowest bark is a breather
How high? How will you decide?
[Chorus]
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
[Bridge]
So long, you keep stalling
Can you not see why?
(Say, say, say)
Loved ones
(Say, say, say)
That you see cry
(Say, say, say)
A simple call seems right
(Say, say, say)
And I know why
(Say, say, say)
[Chorus]
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
(Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
(Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side 'til you die
(Say, say, say)
I'll be a thorn in your side for always
If we sink, we lift our love
(Say, say, say)
[Outro]
(Say, say, say)
(Get up after you)
(Say, say, say)
(Get up after you)
