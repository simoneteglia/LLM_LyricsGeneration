I know it's a lot that you can learn from me
It's just one thing that you gotta prove (

If you gotta walk, would you still ride for me?
I might need a extra foot or two

Gotta keep my distance, they surroundin' me

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
We done did so much around the law
Stay up to forget 'bout what I saw
Powers keep increasin' by the bar
Shit don't make you sleepy after all
Shoppin' in my closet, not the mall
Openin' my mouth, a disco ball
I extend the marble on the wall
I been into designin' it all, all, all
Water down her eyes,
Niagara Falls
Got too many numbers; who to call?
Made too many ways for you to cross
Now we lookin' down and then we
ball, ball, ball
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Ratchet bitches wanted Frenchy's, not Philippe (Ah)
That's the type to put me in my mood (Yeah)
She know that I'm mobbin', she come cool for me (Ah, ah)
She know how to put me in my groove (Yeah)
I know it's a lot that you can learn from me (Ooh)
It's just one thing that you gotta prove (Ah, ah)
If you gotta walk, would you still ride for me? (Ah, ah)
I might need a extra foot or two (Ah, ah, oh)
Gotta keep my distance, they surroundin' me (Ooh)
I might need a extra foot or two (Ooh)
They might have to go and build a house for me (Ooh)
I might need a extra foot or— (Ooh)
[Outro: Morgan Freeman]
Villains don't perceive themselves as wrong
And all heroes do not wear capes
Villains are made, not born
Most times, the villain and the hero's beginnings, unlike their endings, take nearly identical shape and form
