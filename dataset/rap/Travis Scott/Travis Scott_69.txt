[Part I]
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Beat me, I move at night when they really can't see me
I ran it back last time but it ain't last time
I got so much around the house, I had to hide mine (Yeah, oh)
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Throw it all, before I hit the door, she dropped 'em, had the clothes off (Oh)
I thought it was a setup, watch her, I can't doze off
The dogs out the kennel, watchin' with the scope off
With the heat talk, watch it burn your soul off (Ah)
I took 'em out of office, now they work for me now
I took her out the background, she play the lead now (Lead)
Put it in the back gate, or hold the trees down (Trees)
Tryna tell you what I need, somebody do that there
Late at night, at home, get ratchet, can you do that there?
Way out when I'm on road, you send me do that there
Told you I'ma be right back as long as—
Told you I'ma be right back as long as—
Do that there, do that there
Way out when— (Yeah)
Do that there
Late at night, at home, get ratchet, can you do that there? (Can you do it?)
Told you I'ma be right back as long as—, do that there
(Told you I'ma be right back as long as—)
[Chorus: Travis Scott &
Young Thug
]
Beat me, I move at night when they really can't see me
I ran it back last time but it ain't last time
I got so much around the house, I had to hide mine (To hide mine)
Let's go
[Verse 2: Young Thug &
Travis Scott
]
Bling-bling, I get a rush every time I see some diamonds
She get it up, she gon' bounce it like a trampoline
Keep up with swag, she be fresher than a mannequin
All type of bags in her closet like she married to me, married to me
You a puzzle, Patek Phillipe
Keep it right there with my postcode (Slatt, postcode)
I been jumpin' out the gym with no Jordans on (Woah)
She been all above the rim on her torsos (Woah)
Princess cuts, diamonds, I got plenty
Lift it up, air it out, like linen (
Yah
)
Rolls Royce, big ol' truck, I'm in it (
Yah
)
Bouncing 'round like he want smoke, I'm a chimney (
Yah
)
Tall, her hair long, she Jamaican ('Maican)
And she tryna rage in the bedroom (
Yah
)
And she got a Rollie on her leg too (Leg too)
And it's plain gold, Ace of Spade too (Yeah)
Coco Chanel for reals on her toes
I got white folk money, Eminem with no gold
I got rose gold teeth and rose gold rims on my Rolls
Peep the way they lookin', we gettin' richer than a bookie, ayy
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Beat me, I move at night when they really can't see me
I ran it back last time but it ain't last time
I got so much around the house, I had to hide mine (To hide mine)
Believe me, I move at night when they really can't see me
I ran it back last time but it ain't last time
I got so much around the house, I had to hide mine (To hide mine)
[Part II]
[Segue: Travis Scott]
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
[Verse: Travis Scott]
Without goin' deep Shakespeare
Took the squad, brought the play right here (Yeah)
Got the vision and I made that clear (Clear)
Up from two 'til it's two runnin' plays like the Tennessee kid (Tennessee)
I'm the one, that's why they tryna hurt the kid (Kid)
I'm the one, JH, with the braids, with the lights
With the ike and the smoke, but I can't stay away
See this life? Man, I can't stay away
Find a vice, man, I can't stay away
Find it hard, why I can't play it safe?
Seen the top ten pen list, I don't even know how they could pin this
Knowin' that I'm the human Pinterest
Need true love but I know true love's like a friendship
But even Titanic had an endin'
I rock the boat with ice so expensive
Hair long, not no extensions
Money long, shit is extended
She need me now, she need me a pendant
I said you need me now, I ain't finished, huh
[Part III]
[Segue: Travis Scott]
I said, you need me now
I said, you need me now
You need me (Ah)
[Verse: Travis Scott]
I stick to the code, binary like I's and O's (Ooh)
I'm too exposed, I gotta keep curtains closed (Closed)
Her body bold, she hid it behind the clothes (Skeet, skeet, skeet)
I'm in Cabo, I'm hittin' these adios
Tryna balance all these up and downs, but I keep poppin' lows
(Lows)
Man, it is what it is, that's just how it goes
Pure session, I just kept progressin', finally found the flow (Flow)
If the answer's down there with the devil, I may never know
(Let's go)
My dawg just got freed out the precinct (Free)
Hid it in my bag, let's hit Turks for the weekend (Let's go)
Why did I pop two out that whole pack? Dawg, I'm tweakin' (Geeked)
Baby girl, come suck, keep me up, ain't no sleepin', ooh
She gon' let me beat that body up like we beefin' (Beefin')
Better yet she vegan
(Vegan), better yet she tweakin' (Tweakin')
Yeah, 6 A.M., I hit my alarm clock (Yeah)
You see the vision, this shit non-stop, gotta keep my palms hot (Hot)
Got Longhorns in my backyard, bitch, I'm a lonestar
The droptop came with the top, I cut the door apart
My brodie keep a stainless to steal, ain't no Chrome Heart
(Grr)
[Part IV]
[Verse: Travis Scott]
I cut some off, I had to better myself
Against the odds, I'd bet on myself
I was at Frank Gibbins before Thanksgiving, thanks to my health
Too many flaws, tryna generate wealth
Man, that's how you go broke and lose bros and lose hope in this shit
I was thinkin' that we both could be rich, I guess it's one-sided
Crazy how they love to talk shit and got no Trident
I'm loyal, bitch, I got Ye over Biden
I let the shit go off the top, yeah, no typin'
How I go from overlooked to these niggas is overbitin'?
How I'm always in they ear? I'm enticin'
And you ain't gotta take it from me, I'm advisin', for real
