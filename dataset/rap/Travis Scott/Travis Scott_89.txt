[Intro: Grandmaster Flash]
All you cool people, you better leave now
'Cause it's about to happen
[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran &
Travis Scott
]
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo (
Yeah
)
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low (
It's lit!
)
I don't mess with your energy (
Nah
), no photos (
Ayy
)
So antisocial, but I don't care (
Ayy
)
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here (
Ayy, pop it
)
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though (
Ayy, pop it, pop it
)
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (
Straight up!
)
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
Travis Scott
]
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
Travis Scott
]
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (
Straight up
)
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
[Verse 2: Travis Scott &
Ed Sheeran
]
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom (Pew), when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Occupied and movin' dolo
(Ooh, yeah)
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues (Drown)
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you" (Yeah)
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it
(In the boy) Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed (It's lit!)
[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
I've been lost out inner space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
Travis Scott
]
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (
Straight up
)
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
[Outro: Travis Scott]
Don't touch me, yeah
