[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Buddah bless this beat
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, bag it out west (Bag it), slangin' out west (Yeah)
Gold metallic knife, I can shank ya out west (Yeah)
I just put a drum on a new Kel-Tec (On a)
I just put my cum in her pussy, now it's wet
[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
I used to jump off the back of the bus (Yeah), now I jump off of a jet (Yeah)
I used to tell the lil' baby, "This us," then I got over the shit
I used to like her, but now that I love her
The way she was drankin' my spit
Your bitch cheatin', she under my cover, we cuddle and shit
[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Now shawty say she wanna suck on the tip
I'm 'bout it, baby, I want all four of your lips (I'm 'bout it)
Ex-college girl, she can suck up a ship
I eat molly and I take this bitch on a trip
Ayy, shawty, ayy, darlin', ayy, baby girl, suck my private
Close your eyes, it's just me and you and nobody
Ayy, suck it sideways, if we in public or the driveway (Hey)
Vibes in this bitch (Woo), vibe on a jet (Woo)
Five thousand bricks, ooh
She bad as it get, her mouth kick it slick
She know she got the kick
With a fire hydrant pussy
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, bag it out west (Bag it), slangin' out west (Yeah)
Gold metallic knife, I can shank ya out west (Yeah)
I just put a drum on a new Kel-Tec (On a)
I just put my cum in her pussy, now it's wet
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
It's up, it's stuck (Yeah)
Thought you can cross the gang, what was you thinkin' of? (Gang)
Red coupe, rollercoaster sound just like it does
These days, I balance all the hate out with the love
These days, I pour all of my pain out in a cup (Drank)
Dreamy, that's just a side effect when you with us (Game)
Easy, the dawgs is right behind me, they on edge
Believe me, we pop out in the city to collect (Ooh)
Vibes in this bitch, they surprised that I lived (It's lit)
Try, can't be killed, tried nine times but I'm Stilts
Hop in the whip to hop right in the whip
I hotbox in the whip, got me (Ooh)
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Ayy, bag it out west (Bag it), slangin' out west (Yeah)
Gold metallic knife, I can shank ya out west (Yeah)
I just put a drum on a new Kel-Tec (On a)
I just put my cum in her pussy, now it's wet
[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
I used to jump off the back of the bus (Yeah), now I jump off of a jet (Yeah)
I used to tell the lil' baby, "This us" (Yeah), then I got over the shit (Yeah)
I used to like her, but now that I love her
The way she was drankin' my spit (Woah, woah)
Your bitch cheatin', she under my cover, we cuddle and shit
[Outro]
Buddah bless this beat
