[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
You taste good like soul food
Parked up outside in the old-school
The new me back with the old you
A dog always find his way back home and it's so true
Make it home, fall through and pop one
You know the motto's: "Smoke some, drink some, pop one"
Got your hand on my Glock while your ass ride shotgun
High, high stakes, we risk it every day
Ride around, around
I know fuckin' ugly niggas just not fun
Had to zero out the fade 'cause I'm not one,
yeah, yeah
[Bridge: Travis Scott]
So smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Smoke some, drink some, pop one (Lit)
Yeah

Your mama never let you guys outside
She probably still beat your ass
Man, what the…
Man, you a virgin? You a virgin, huh?
Your lil' small, your lil' skinny ass can't even take it
What you doin' with that weed?
Where you get that? Huh?
I'ma tell your mama
