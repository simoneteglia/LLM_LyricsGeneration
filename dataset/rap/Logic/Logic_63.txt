[Verse 1]
When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well, they'd be singing so happily
Oh, joyfully, oh, playfully watching me
But then they sent me away to teach me how to be sensible
Logical, oh, responsible, practical
And then they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Oh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical
[Chorus 1]
There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am
[Verse 2]
I said, watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal, oh, fanatical, criminal
Oh, won't you sign up your name? We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable
Oh, take, take, take it, yeah
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus 2]
But at night, when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please (Won't you tell me)
Please tell me what we've learned?
(Can you hear me?) I know it sounds absurd
(Won't you help me?) But please, tell me who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Ooh
Hey
[Outro]
'Cause I was feeling so illogical, yeah
D-d-d-d-d-d-digital
Yeah, one, two, three, five
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ooh, it's getting unbelievable
Yeah
