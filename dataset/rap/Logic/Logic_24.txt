[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I been buried alive
I
I
I
I-I, buried alive
I
I
I
I-I
[Verse 1]
Everything happens for a reason
Happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Uh, death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You could make it work, but that still ain't driven
Give a lot, but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this, I feel so
Dead wrong,
collision is
Head-on, my vision is
Dead and gone
, perception of
Right and wrong, I been here so
Very long right here in this
Very song, uh
Look around, everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don’t go outside 'cause it’s dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous?
I’m so OCD if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me
Man, everybody want this shit for free
Hand out, palm up when they get to me
In my mind, no, I never let it get to me
Everybody got a turn, will it get to me?
V’s up motherfucker, that’s victory
Tell me why what I’m doin' ain’t shit to me, damn
[Pre-Chorus]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)
Know, know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)
Know, know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)
(Yeah,) I, (Yeah,) I
(Yeah,) I, (Yeah,) I
(Yeah,) I, (Yeah,) I
(Yeah,) I-I, buried alive
(Yeah,) I, (Yeah,) I
(Yeah,) I, (Yeah,) I
(Yeah,) I, (Yeah,) I
(Yeah,) I-I
[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
Do you really wanna be famous?
Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?
Bitches out here be shameless
And I really wonder where they parents are
Look around, everything changes
It feels like I been buried alive
(Let it breathe)
[Verse 2]
(Uh) I'm feelin' this villainous feelin' inside of my
Mind
,
every time that I’m willin' I feel like I'm
Killin' my dreams when that voice go
Nah, nah, nah
, listen up now
Love it or hate it, never debate it, you can never degrade it
While all these other motherfuckers prob'ly thinkin' I made it
My mind jaded, no—I never evade it
I elevate it just to keep it innovative, innovator
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like
Iraq now, RattPack put me on the map now
No, we never back down
, just take my
Time, I just take my time
I know, I'ma get it like this
So everyone know that I did it like this, yeah
I know—I'ma take my time
Battle the image inside of my mind
I know, I'ma keep goin'
Tell me I can't, but I'm already knowin'
I know, I'm gonna rise
Even though I been—
[Pre-Chorus]
Buried alive (Buried alive)
Will I survive? (Buried alive)
I gotta know
Know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)
Know, know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)
Know, know, know, know, know, know (Alive, alive)

[Chorus]
Tell me how you feel (Tell me how you feel)
I feel like the grass is green
And everything I do is unseen
But I know that’s just in my mind
I know everything is just in my mind
