[Chorus: The Alpha & Cardi B]
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
Me, I'm your daddy, you're my mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami in it
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mom, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mom, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mom, mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami in it
You are my daddy (And you my mom)

I Don't Fuck With Fools (Cardi)
The real
Lassie

Lazzy
Fine, how rich all
You gave me an AP (AP)
Do you want me to Take a Selfie ?
I laugh at you, I say "lol" (Ha)
I'm in vanity and you're in love (Cardi)
I want to feel the best (huh)
In my bed making love to me
Right now
[Chorus: The Alpha & Cardi B]
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
I am your daddy, you are my mommy

You are my daddy (And you my mom)
You are my daddy
[Verse 2: The Alpha]
I am your daddy, the Hottest on the block
Stay with me, marry me
I kill the first one that touches you
She is rapper, but dresses fine
Balenciaga Bag with some repairs
I like it when she walks
When we are in bed
She eats me like Kentucky
In the disco, with a lot of diamonds
Flow "Walk It Like I Talk It"
Your friend clarifies that I am your
loki-troki
The one you like above and below
I'm stronger than Rocky
You're clear that I'm your cool daddy
You are deep in love with me because you give me your ass
You, you, you, you clearly know that I am your cool daddy
You are deep in love with me because you give me your ass
[Chorus: The Alpha & Cardi B]
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
I am your daddy, you are my mommy
Me, I'm your daddy, you're my mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami in it
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mom, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mom, mommy
I am your daddy, daddy, you are my mom, mommy
When you give me 'that bread, I put the salami in it
You are my daddy (And you my mom)
You are my daddy (And you my mom)
You are my daddy (And you my mom)
You are my daddy (And you my mom)
