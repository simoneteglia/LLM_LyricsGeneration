[Intro]
(Goofy Ahh Uncle Productions)
[Verse]
I wanna take a pic with Cardi B inside my cardigan (Ree-hee-hee-hee)
Niggas know I'm late, they call me Shordie, Mr. Tardy Man (Waoh-oh)
I just smoke my weed
and
fuck these hoes,
I'm not no party man (Noo!)
Hit the plug and check that gas and take off in that Harley, man
