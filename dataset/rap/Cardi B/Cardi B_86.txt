Every time I turn around she gets pissed off (Ah-ha)
Little dusty sеlf, go get a lint brush (Woo)
You gon' settle down, you gon' livе with him (What?)

My body built like a stallion (Yeah)
All these wannabes my lil' ponies
They be camped out in the comments
Always talkin' like they know me (Ayy)
Pretty girls in the black truck, packed in
Eat whoever in my way, Ms. Pacman
Hermès, made a real big purchase
Purse so big, had to treat it like a person
Ayy, I look good in real life (In real life)
Show me real love (Yeah, yeah), I don't care about them likes ('Bout them likes)
Hear them tryna say I ain't fine, oh, aight
They know I'm thick like I'm eatin' beans with the rice
Like lean over ice, got the real meat pies (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I be spillin' like my booty out these jeans when they tight (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And the way they watch me, need to be monetized (Ah)
I'ma need a money bag if I sleep overnight
Wait, wait (Hold up), wait, wait (Hold up), wait
Girls pop pills, but I'm the one they can't take (Yeah)
Hot-girl sh—, I'ma make somethin' shake (Brrt)
I know these stiff girls can't relate (Ah)

Shoot your shot like a free throw (Free throw)

My back shots sound like bongos

Pow-pow-pow

I ain't scared to admit I'm a freak

Y'all be broke, took more turns than a key hole

Neck full of diamonds, yeah, I'm forever froze
