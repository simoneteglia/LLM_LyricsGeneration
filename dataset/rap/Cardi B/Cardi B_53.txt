[Intro]
Up, up, up (Ayy), up (Uh), up, look (
This is fire
)
Once upon a time, man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a chick who **** wanna touch on me
[Refrain]
I said my face bomb, abs tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make you wanna act right
Broke boys don't deserve no kitty
(I know that's right)
[Pre-Chorus]
Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back, know how I give it up
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back, know how I give it up
[Chorus]
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)
Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck (Huh)
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Woo)
[Verse 1]
I could make the party hot, I could make your body rock
Haters can't do nothin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a stick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Shorty speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' it, pullin' up and droppin' it
Gotta argue with him 'cause you know he love a toxic chick
**** out here playin', gotta make him understand
If ain't no ring on my finger, you ain't goin' on my 'Gram
[Refrain]
I said my face bomb, abs tight (Yeah)
Racks stack up Shaq height (Yeah)
Jewelry on me, flashlight (Huh)
I been lit since last night (Woo)
Hit him with that good good
Make you wanna act right (Ah)
Broke boys don't deserve no kitty
(I know that's right)
[Pre-Chorus]
Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back, know how I give it up (Woo)
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back, know how I give it up
[Chorus]
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)
Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)
[Verse 2]
**** ain't messin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty, dusty, girl, you got pink eye
Say they want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Please tell her back back, breath smell like horse (Ah)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)
Tatted on my back 'cause I really like the pain (Ah)
He **** on my ****, I said, "I'm glad that you came"
If that **** had a twin, I would let 'em run a **** (Skrrt)
[Pre-Chorus]
Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back, know how I give it up (Woo)
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back, know how I give it up (Ooh)
[Chorus]
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Woo)
Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck (Woo)
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh
[Outro]
Look, gotta play it safe, huh
No face, no case (Hahaha)
