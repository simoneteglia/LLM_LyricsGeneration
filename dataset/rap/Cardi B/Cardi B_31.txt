[Intro: Summer Walker]
Mm, mm, mm (Better stop playin' with me)
(Bitch better stop playin' with me)
Bitter, oh, mad at me, mad at my nigga (Better stop playin' with me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Playin' with me)
(Better stop playin' with me) Mm
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Bitter, yeah, mad at me, mad at my nigga
Mad at the fact he ain't with you
Mad at the fact that it's me
But this shit bigger than me and you alone
So why you puttin' on for the Shade Room and Insta'?
Bitches just be lookin' for attention
[Verse 1: Summer Walker]
Trust me, you can get it (Get it)
Pull up whenever, whenever, you know I'm with it
Don't gеt it twisted
Nothin' like none of thеse bitches
But sometimes, I get in my feelings
Sometimes, I know I be trippin' (Trippin')
But why these hoes all in our business?
How he don't care 'bout his children? (How he don't care?)
How he's supposed to be there? Y'all won't let him get 'em ('Posed to be there)
How you posted like that on the 'Gram for a thousand?
I bet you can't post a picture (Bet you can't, bet you can't)
Wonderin' if you even knew this bitch for real
London, did you screw this bitch for real?
They be on that groupie shit for real
And I know she thought she struck once she let a nigga fuck
Man, that bitch is lookin' stuck (Stuck as fuck)
And I bet you when you came that she thought she came up
Now that bitch up feelin' dumb (I bet your bitch feelin' dumb)
She probably thought it came with a million (Came with a million)
She probably thought you changed how she livin'
Probably thought that dick came with the fame and the riches
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Bitter (Bitter), mad at me, mad at my nigga
Mad at the fact he ain't with you
Mad at the fact that it's me
But this shit bigger than me and you alone
So why you puttin' on for the Shade Room and Insta'?
Bitches just be lookin' for attention
[Verse 2: Summer Walker]
Bitter baby mama
Always point her finger at a nigga whenever it's a problem
Always put the blame on a nigga instead of tryna solve it
Always wanna gossip
Her and her friend have been talkin'
But whatever they be sayin' ain't 'bout shit (
Ain't 'bout shit
)
Think a nigga supposed to pay for they outfit
Get they nails and feet done and her hair did, yeah
You ain't shit, bitch
Claim you independent, but you ain't did shit
Live in Section 8 and still can't pay rent (Better stop playin' with me)
You ain't shit, bitch
So your children with your mama and you ain't raised shit
But you want that child support, what you think this is? Oh (Better stop playin' with me)
Just because you let him smash, that don't mean he ever knew you (Better stop playin' with me)
Just 'cause y'all got a past, that don't mean you got a future (Better stop playin' with me)
This mine for life (For life)
No switchin' sides (Switchin' sides)
We ride or die and that's why I know you
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Bitter (Bitter), mad at me, mad at my nigga
Mad at the fact he ain't with you
Mad at the fact that it's me
But this shit bigger (
This shit bigger
) than me and you alone
So why you puttin' on for the Shade Room and Insta'? (
Shade Room
)
Bitches just be lookin' for attention

Better stop playin' with me

Bitch better stop playin' with me

Well, Summer Walker, you know I been seein'
You know, all the bullshit that's been goin' on with you today
And, you know, I don't know if the rumors are true
I don't know, I don't care, it's not my business, but if it is true
Don't let bitches, like, make
Don't let them feel like they have a one-up by destroying your moment
By fucking telling your business to the world
On some, "Ha-ha, yeah, I'ma do it on purpose, I'ma do it spitefully"
Do it your own way and do it beautifully, do it special
If you are pregnant and everything, say it in a beautiful way in your music
Say why you, you know, decided to be with your nigga
Even though you have problems, put that drama in your music, yeah
'Cause if bitches wanna get clout off you, you gonna get clout off them
And you gonna put that shit in your music
Say some shit like, "I got my own fuckin' money"
Make them bitches feel hurt, hit them bitches where it hurt
And put that shit in your music and make money off it in your music
Fuck these hoes
