[Verse 3: Myke Towers]
Get creative, all women are beautiful
But the ones I like most are Latin
She's not a lesbian, but she sometimes secretly fucks her girlfriend
She moves her hips to the rhythm of the music
She makes me hyperactive
She does the things and they don't catch her, yah, yah, yah
We've done everything, I've been able to do everything
What style and what way, me everything
I'd do all of those dirty things again
She's my soulmate, we're both addicted to sex
[Chorus: Anitta,
Anitta & Myke Towers
