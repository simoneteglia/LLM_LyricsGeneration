All of my opps get mixed with the grabba
Broke bitch said she was gon' touch me (Like, what?)

All the bros know I'm uppin', I'll boom for 'em (Boom)
All the opps hope heaven got room for 'em (Grrah)
Everything's dead, nothin' is friendly

[Chorus: Bory300 &

Shorty, she buggin', she want me to spank it, like
[Outro: Akon]
Hey ladies, drop it down

Shake ya' body like a belly dancer
