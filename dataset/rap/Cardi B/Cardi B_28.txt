[Intro]
Yeah baby, I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like—
[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Now I like dollars
, I like diamonds, I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio
Oh, damn
[Chorus: Cardi B]
Diamond district in the chain (
I said I like it like that
)
Certified, know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang (
I said I like it like—
)
Drop the top and blow the brains (
I said I like it like that
)
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name? (
I said I like it
)
Oh I need the dollars (
I said I like it like that
)
Beat it up like piñatas (
I said I like it like—
)
Tell the driver, close the curtains (
I said I like it like that
)
Bad bitch make him nervous (
I said I like it
)
Cardi B
[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
They reload, they reload, but don't pull the trigger (pull the trigger!)
You buy all the Jordan's, fool, they gift them to me
I spend in the club (woo), what you have in the bank (yeh)
This is the new religion, bang, in Latino gang, gang, yeh
I try to diet (yeh), but in the closet I got too much fat (woo!)
I already moved the Gucci to inside my house, yeh (woo!)
Motherfucker, nobody knows you, not even in Plaza (no)
The Devil calls me but Jesus Christ hugs me (amen)
Guerrero like Eddie, long live the race (yeh)
I like Boricuas, I like Cubans [whistling]
I like the accent of the Colombians (what's going on?)
I like how she shakes the ass the Dominican (what's up?)
How good they fuck me the Venezuelans (woo!)
We are active, Perico Pin Pin (woo)
Hundred dollar bills in the briefcase (ching)
Let the bass resound, Bobby Valentin, yeh
Love is forbidden here, tell them, Charytín
For their itching I got Claritin
I arrive at the club and the riot begins
[Chorus: Cardi B &
Bad Bunny
]
Diamond district in the chain
(I said I like it like that)
Bad Bunny, baby, be, be, be, be
Certified, know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang
(I said I like it like—)
Drop the top and blow the brains
(I said I like it like that)
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name?
(I said I like it)
Oh, I need the dollars
(I said I like it like that)
Beat it up like piñatas
(I said I like it like—)
Tell the driver, close the curtains
(I said I like it like that)
Bad bitch make him nervous
(I said I like it)
[Verse 3: J Balvin]
Like Celia Cruz I got the sugar (sugar)
Your girl saw me and fell forward like Jimmy Snuka (ah)
We gonna knock off your wig
And go to hell, motherfucker, we aren't gonna pass you the hookah (hookah, hookah)
My Balenciaga shoes, they receive me in the entrance (woo)
Pa-pa-pa-pa-razzi, like I'm Lady Gaga (woo)
And don't play dumb (hey), in covers of Billboard you have seen me (hey)
I don't leave your head (woo)
Everywhere you go you have heard "Mi Gente"
I'm not high, I'm like the Testarossa ('rossa)
I'm the one who lives it and enjoys it (enjoys it, enjoys it)
That's the thing, baby that's the thing (thing, thing)
The one who looks suffers and the one who touches enjoys (enjoys, enjoys)
[Bridge: J Balvin &
Cardi B

I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that (rrr)
I said I like it like that (woo)
I said I like it like that
[Chorus: Cardi B]
Diamond district in the chain (
I said I like it like that
)
Certified, know I'm gang, gang (
I said I like it like—
)
Drop the top and blow the brains, wouh (

Oh he's so handsome, what's his name? (
I said I like it
