Lyrics from Snippets
[Verse 1]
Don’t get offended by rumors, cause I done bout heard a few
You might’ve heard I like red, but I’ll snuff a bitch out the blue
Hell yeah...
[Chorus]
Ayy (Ayy), put some respect on my name
I brought you nothing but flames
I'm 'boutta do it again
Big booty bitch on the plane
He wanna make me his main flame
He may buy you everything (Gang)
But he won't buy you no ring (Gang)
[Verse 2]
I get the...
...bitch at the house
Hundred dollars in the 'Vette (Bang)
Couple models think it's changed
But there's a couple of plugs
Think I don't walk with this bitch
Pussy hoppin' like the gun (Gun)
He never leave when I come
He not texting you bum bitches
Not when this cat got his tongue
[Chorus]
Ayy (Ayy), put some respect on my name
I brought you nothing but flames
I'm 'boutta do it again
Big booty bitch on the plane
He wanna make me his main flame
He may buy you everything (Gang)
But he won't buy you no ring (Gang)
[Verse 3]
I gave that boy a vasectomy
I should bought [?]
That's for my bitch who wanna stay with me...
