Monsta's gon' tear it up

Bitches be pressed (Woo)
Bitches be pressed (Pressed)

[Verse 1]
Bitches be pressed (Pressed)
They knew how I'm coming, real bitch in the flesh (Woo)
Who the fuck she gon' check? (Who?)
She be talking that shit, talkin' out of her neck (Brr)
Put blood on her dress (Woo)
Bitches be mad when they see Cardi step in the spot (Woah)
Said that you 'bout it, we know that you not
I'ma pull up on bitches as soon as I drop
Bought a new foreign, I might cop a yacht (Skrrt)
Bitches in my business, they tryna plot (Woo)
Hoes poppin' shit like they hot but they not (No)
Just flooded the wrist, the Patek, the watch (Woah)
Niggas be flexing, we know what you got
Cardi done had got the game in a knot
Fuckin' your nigga, I got him on lock
This go bang bang like I'm choppin' them chops
VVS chain, I'm in love with the rocks (Woah)
You said you gon' take it, bitch, you got me chopped (Woah)
They throwin' shade 'cause they see me on top
Tell that bitch to pull up, I'ma send you the drop
[Chorus]
Press, press, press, press, press
Cardi don't need more press
Kill 'em all, put them hoes to rest
Walk in, bulletproof vest
Please tell me who she gon' check
Murder scene, Cardi made a mess
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
[Verse 2]
Ding dong
Must be that whip that I ordered
And a new crib for my daughter
You know a bad bitch gon' spoil her
Got one in New York, need one in Georgia (Yeah)
New Bentley truck cost a quarter (Quarter)
My money still long like weave (Woo)
Pussy still wet like Florida (Woo)
Everyone drop on the floor
She was talkin' but not anymore (No)
MAC to your face like contour (Brr)
This chopper come straight from Dior
Done with the talkin', I'm open to violence
Ask anybody, they know I'm about it
Hashtag whip that ho ass
Fuck around, we gon' start a new challenge (Woo)
I come in this bitch and I'm strapped up and ready
Ridin' that dick like I'm Cardi Andretti
Fuck at your crib, we don't go to no 'telly
I sit on his face whenever I'm ready (Woo)
Bitch I'm a freak like Greek (Like Greek)
Got the biggest house on my street (My street)
All you little hoes look cheap (Look cheap)
They suckin' on my dick with no teeth
[Chorus]
Press, press, press, press, press
Cardi don't need more press
Kill 'em all, put them hoes to rest
Walk in, bulletproof vest
Please tell me who she gon' check
Murder scene, Cardi made a mess
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
[Outro]
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
