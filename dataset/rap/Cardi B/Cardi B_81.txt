[Intro: Cardi B]
Cardi
[Verse 1: Cardi B]
I got that sauce and that water
Set them hoes in a corner
I wake up and get paid
Everyday in that order
Had some hoes that was hatin’
Now they act like supporters
In my face tryna make up
Like they Mike or Sephora
But I leave a bitch wet if I let up, she gon need a first aid at the Red Cross
Skrt, skrt dip off in a red Porsche
Everything on my list getting checked off
Wet neck, wet wrist I’m as wet as jet skis
They was sleepin’ on a bitch now I’m a fucking wet tree
