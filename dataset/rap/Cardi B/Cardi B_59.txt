[Intro: Summer Walker]
Oh, ooh woah
Oh-oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Cardi B,
Summer Walker
]
Here I am, there you are, fallin' out of love again
I don't know just how to feel inside
I'll meet you where you are (Are)
I needed some time apart (
'part, ooh
)
'Cause you been playin'
I've been loyal, no questions, boy, I've been ten toes down (
Ten toes down
)
Cut communications with niggas that wanna be around (
Be around
)
So I found it crazy how bitches is in my mentions now (
Now
)
Nothin' that you're sayin' add up to me, how I'm feelin' now (Feelin',
ooh
)
I just wanna be everything you need
I wish you could see how you hurting me
I got no more love, this time, I'm done with that (
Done with that
)
I'm thinkin' of ways that I can hurt you back
[Verse 2: Summer Walker]
If I had you back (Back)
I wouldn't've did all that (That)
I would'vе played it just how you wanted to play it
You didn't yet see my worth, so you try to play mе
But I was so in love, love
That I just got a little bit too complicated
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
But if I had you back, all I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Get drunk), take drugs (Take drugs)
(Fuck love)
All I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Oh), hop planes
All lust, there will be no lovin' you
It would be no lovin' you
[Verse 3: SZA]
If I did it all again
I would give, like, ten percent
You deserve, like, half of that
I'ma need my money back
I'm ridin' through your hood, you pissed me off again
Finna let new niggas come find me
I've been trippin' like I don't got that designer pussy
All I'm tryna see is your credit card, swipe it all for me
Get me what I want, I don't need it
Just CC me, just VV me, just that dick when I call (Dick when I call)
No more feelings involved, I done seen all I need to
Funny how you say you 'bout us
You don't ever pull up on me, put it on me, get me right (Right)
You the one that ruined us, can't give no, can't give no
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Get drunk), take drugs (Take drugs)
(Fuck love)
All I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Oh), hop planes
All lust, there will be no lovin' you
It would be no lovin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 4: Summer Walker]
Come to find out you weren't even worth my time
Tried to act like I wasn't good enough in your eyes
Funny now that you callin', that you ringin' my line
Why the hell is you ringin' my line?
Oh, I
Tell me what's changed, is it my status? Is it my fame?
Is it my pockets? Is it my change?
Is it my pride? Is it my body?
Back then, "No show, no call" was your motto
Only hit me up after the club and you off that bottle
Pussy so good you thought you hit the lotto
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
But if I had you back, all I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Get drunk), take drugs (Take drugs)
Fuck love
All I wanna do is fuck (Fuck)
Get drunk (Oh), hop planes
All lust, it will be no lovin' you
It will be no lovin' you
[Outro: Summer Walker]
Come to find out you weren't even worth my time
Tried to act like I wasn't good enough in your eyes
Funny now that you callin', that you ringin' my line
Why the hell is you ringin' my line?
