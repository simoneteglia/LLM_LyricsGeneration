[Intro: Camilo Sesto,
Cardi B
]
Un adiós sin razones
Unos años sin valor
Bardi
[Verse 1]
Ain't no half-steppin', all I do is break records
Now I play chess, so a bitch can't checker
Made it out of hell and it's still gettin' hectic
And my life is a movie, only Cardi could direct it
Only take cash, they ain't never gave credit
Had to risk it all in myself, so I bet it
Started on the pole, in the end, don't regret it
They'll use the past against you if you let 'em
But I'm back and I'm better,
got Henny on the line
Tell her that I have real shit on my mind
'Cause the clocks start tickin' from the day I got signed
Million-dollar watch 'cause a bitch got time
They'll tell you everything 'bout me but the grind
Tell you there's a bitch this hot, then they lyin'
If I pay for the streams, why the fuck you ain't buyin'?
When these hoes start hatin', these hoes start lyin'
[Chorus: Camilo Sesto]
Años sin valor
[Verse 2]
I got dressed for the stages,
got dressed for the court
Dressed for my husband, told him, "Rip this shit off"
Got dressed for the GRAMMYs, then I left with awards
Hundred-thousand dollar dress left on the floor
They was losin' they mind when I hit the Met Gala
Tail so long, it dragged thirty minutes after
After the tears, you can get to the laughter
After the bookings, on to the next chapter
Got goals that I want, got goals that I met
Gold on my neck that I froze in baguettes
More movie sets mean more movie checks
'Cause I live in a mansion, I don't live with regrets
Plans for the fam, got Kulture the jet
Told us to invest, so the culture is set
Blam-blam-blam, if you posin' a threat
Never did it for clout, never talked on the set, bitch
[Chorus: Camilo Sesto,
Cardi B
]
Años sin valor
Uh
[Verse 3]
Who they all come get when they want shit chartin'?
Labels hit me when they wanna break artists
After we break bread, then we get shit started
I don't say want it unless Cardi B on it
Then I'm on some shit 'cause I done some shit
Checks sound like I just won some shit
Shoot up the charts like I gun some shit
Got a Reebok deal 'cause I run this shit
All the dope boys want all the Wall Street dudes
Chefs in the mansions, I don't even buy food
Used to laugh at my raps, sayin' I would get booed
Now I get a big bag, that's a big move
From the Bronx to the 'burbs, make big moves
Rock red bottoms, made 'em big shoes
Paid dues, and I'm so focused
'Cause the money never made me, bein' broke did, bitch
[Chorus: Camilo Sesto]
Un adiós sin razones
Unos años sin valor
