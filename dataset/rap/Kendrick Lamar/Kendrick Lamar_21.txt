[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me (Do to me)
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me (New to me)
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me (Truth to me)
Fuck you and all your expectations (Expectations)
I don't even want your congratulations (Congratulations)
I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises
All in your conversation (Conversation)
I hate people that feel entitled (Entitled)
Look at me crazy 'cause I didn't invite you (Invite you)
Oh, you important? You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you (Like you)
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift (With a gift)
That's how you find out who you dealin' with (Dealin' with)
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with (Buildin' with)
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my mama, that's the realest shit
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
All the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin'
like ya involved
Like a rebound,
no control
No off switch in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We been runnin' out of time
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar,
SZA
]
Love, let's talk about love (
Let's talk about love, is
)
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? (
Anything, oh, oh, this
)
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt;
Haunt, haunt
)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you (All the stars approach you)
All the stars approach you (All the stars approach you)
All the stars approach you (All the stars approach you)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer (All the stars are closer)
All the stars are closer (All the stars are closer)
All the stars are closer (All the stars are closer)
