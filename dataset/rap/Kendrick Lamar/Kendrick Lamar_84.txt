[Intro]
This is a world premiere (This is a world premiere)
This is a world premiere
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror, they found me
[Chorus]
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs), I love myself
(But it can do what it want, whenever it want, I don't mind), I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide), I love my, self
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
[Verse 1]
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
[Chorus]
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs), I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind), I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide), I love my, self
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
[Verse 2]
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene, yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up "fi-fie-fo-fum" basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Ayy, ayy)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
[Chorus]
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs), I love myself
(But it can do what it want, whenever it want, I don't mind), I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide), I love my, self
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
[Bridge]
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down, valley deep (Down, down valley deep, I love myself)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (Fi-fie-fo-fum, I love myself)
My heart undone (My heart undone, I love myself)
[Refrain]
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs (I love myself)
But it can do what it want, whenever it want, I don't mind (I love myself)
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide (I love my, self)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
(Hold up)
[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself"
[Outro]
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh, woes keep me,
it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
(I)
[Car Horns]
