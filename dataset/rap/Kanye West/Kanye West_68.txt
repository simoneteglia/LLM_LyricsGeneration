[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeezy season approachin'
Fuck whatever y'all been hearin'
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearin'
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran,
hah!
[Chorus: Kanye West]
On sight, on sight
[Bridge: Kanye West]
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now 'fore you give it up
[Interlude: Holy Name of Mary Choral Family]
Oh, He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't judge 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That's when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth
[Chorus: Kanye West]
On sight, on sight
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
[Outro: Kanye West]
Right now
I need right now
Right now
I need, I need right now
Right now
I need, I need right now
