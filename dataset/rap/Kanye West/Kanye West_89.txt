[Refrain: Flux Pavilion]
I can't stop
I can't stop
[Chorus: Kanye West &
JAY-Z
]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Black cards, black cars, black on black, Black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
[Post-Chorus: JAY-Z,
Kanye West
&
both
]
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need State Farm
So many watches, I need eight arms
One neck, but got eight charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Niggas talking, they bitch-made, ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's Pig Latin, itch-bay, who gon' stop me, huh?
Last night ain't go so well, got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert, yes, tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say nothin'
Heard she fucked the doorman, well, that's cool, I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces
[Chorus: Kanye West &
JAY-Z
]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Black cards, black cars, black on black, Black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
[Bridge: Kanye West &
JAY-Z
]
Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah's circle
I wrote the verse that I hope'll hurt you (
Yeah, yeah, let's go
)
[Verse 2: JAY-Z &
Kanye West
]
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Beat the odds, beat the feds
It wouldn't be wise to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, six to six
Give me one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white wearin' no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy, they don't have no proof
I'm three steps removed,
I know how to move
It's looking like I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gamblin'
Lucky lefty, I expect a seven
I went through hell, I'm expectin' heaven
I'm owed,
'cause I'm dough, and I stuck to the G-code
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't goin' nowhere
Okay, here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to havin' bunny ears, like broke, like nope
Like ha, I ain't no joke
I can't be stopped, like nope, like nope
Extend the beat, Noah (
And pray to the Lord
), uh
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Two seats in the 911, uh
No limit on the Black Card, uh
Told y'all I was gon' go H.A.M., uh
'Til the ocean was my backyard, uh
No lies in my verses, hey
Please pardon all the curses, hey
Shit gotta come in some way, fuck
When you growing up worthless, uh
Middle finger to my old life, uh
Special shoutout to my oldhead, uh
If it wasn't for your advice, uh
A nigga would have been so dead, uh
I'm living life 'til these niggas kill me
Turn this up if you niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, tryna get filthy
Pablo Picasso,
Rothkos,
Rilkes
Graduated to the MoMA
And I did all of this without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna
Street-smart and I'm book-smart
Could've been a chemist, 'cause I cook smart
Only thing can stop me is me, hey
And I'ma stop when the hook start, hold up
[Chorus: Kanye West &
JAY-Z
]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Black cards, black cars, black on black, Black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for
