[Intro: Kanye West &

Turn my headphones up
Louder
Uh-huh, uh-huh
What you need,
what—what you need
I got what you need, what—what you need
What you need, what—what you need
I got what you need
[Verse 1: Kanye West &
Jay-Z
]
Hello, hello, hello, hello, white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah, they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony or who gon' try to embarrass ya?
I'ma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller,
but I switched it for a Mille
'Cause I’m richer, and prior to this shit, was movin' free base
Had a conference with the DJs (
Yeah?
), Puerto Rico, three days
Poli with the PDs, now they got our shit on replay
Sorry I'm in pajamas, but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
Ain't that where the Heat play?
(Yup)
Niggas hate ballers these days
(Yup)
Ain't that like LeBron James?
Ain't that just like D-Wade? Wait
[Interlude:
James Brown
]
What you need, what—what you need
I got what you need, what—what you need
What you need, what—what you need
I got what you need
[Verse 2: Jay-Z &
Kanye West
]
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, motherfucker? Where my money at?
You gon' make me come down to your house where your mommy at
Mummy wrap the kids, have 'em cryin' for they mommy back
Dummy that your daddy is, tell him I just want my racks
Racks on racks on racks
(Racks)
Maybachs on 'Bachs on 'Bachs on 'Bachs on 'Bachs
Who in that?
Oh shit, it's just Blacks on Blacks on Blacks
Hundred stack,
how you get it?
Nigga, layin' raps on tracks
I wish I could give you this feeling, I'm planking on a million
I'm riding through your hood, you can bank I ain't got no ceiling
Made a left on Nostrand Ave,
(Right),
we in Bed-Stuy
Made a right on 79th, I'm coming down South Shore Drive
I remain Chi-Town,
Brooklyn 'til I die
[Outro: James Brown]
Take 'em on home
I got what you need, what—what you need
Take 'em on home
What you need, what—what you need
I got what you need, what—what you need
Take 'em on home
Tryna hurt my name, huh?
