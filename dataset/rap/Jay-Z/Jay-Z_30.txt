[Intro: JAY-Z]
Uh-huh, uh, uh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em
[Verse 1: JAY-Z,
Jay-Z & Beyonce
]
Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside
Highway
Doin' what we like to do,
our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla
[Chorus: JAY-Z &
Beyoncé
]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(
Me and my boyfriend
, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend, look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(
Me and my boyfriend
)
[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin', if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs,
Aviator lens
Six hundred drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
[Chorus: JAY-Z &
Beyoncé
]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(
Me and my boyfriend
, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend, look for me)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(
Me and my boyfriend
, talk to 'em, B)
[Bridge: Beyoncé,
JAY-Z
&
Both

If I was your girlfriend (
Uh, uh, uh-huh
)
I'll be there for you (
Woo, uh
)
If somebody hurts you (
Uh
)
Even if that somebody
was me (
Woo, that's hot
)
Yeah-hee (
Uh, break it down for 'em, B
)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be (
Take 'em outside
)
And so I put this on my life (
Woo, uh
)
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us (
Woo, uh, woo
)
And I promise I'll give my life (
Woo, I'm dancin', woo
)
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (
One more time
)
Put this on my life (
Uh, uh, uh
)
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in (
Woo, uh
)
I promise I'll give my life (
Woo
)
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (
Uh, uh
)
[Chorus: JAY-Z &
Beyoncé
]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(
Me and my boyfriend
, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(
Me and my boyfriend
)
