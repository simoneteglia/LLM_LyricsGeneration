[Intro:
Nina Simone
& Kanye West]
Yeah, uh
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Me and the RZA connect
Breeze driftin' on by
Yeah, me and the RZA connect
Breeze driftin' on by
Uh
It's a new life for me, yeah
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, ooh
Uh
And I'm feeling good
Yeah, uh
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean, I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwinds
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to LA
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray
[Interlude:
Nina Simone
& JAY-Z]
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
Breeze driftin' on by
It's a new life for me, yeah
Me and the RZA connect
It's a new life for me, ooh
Me and the RZA connect
And I'm feeling good
Yeah
[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Sorry, junior, I already ruined ya
'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
Sins of a father make your life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach you good values so you cherish it
Took me twenty-six years to find my path
My only job is cut the time in half
So at thirteen, we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it
Give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
'Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him
[Outro: Nina Simone]
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
Breeze driftin' on by
It's a new life for me, yeah
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, ooh
And I'm feeling good
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
It's a new life for me, yeah
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, ooh
And I'm feeling
Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
