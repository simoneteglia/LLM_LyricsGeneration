[Intro: Jack King]
All engines running
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (
Lift off
)
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
We don't know what we could do to make it this far
So many scars
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lift off
Lift off, takin' my coat off
Showing my tattoos, I'm such a show-off, hah
I feel the pain and then roll off
I got the whole city, they about to go off
How many niggas with me up and in the aisle? (
Lift off
)
How many people want to roll on me now? (
Lift off
)
Like you know, na-na-na, you know me by now (
Lift off
)
Know me, know me by now (
Lift off
)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (
Lift off
)
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
We don't know what we could do to make it this far
So many scars
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars
[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Lift off (
Lift off
), off, ah, like you know, na-na-na
You know me by now, know me, know me by now
You know me, know me by now, know me, know me by now
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Lift off
Rappers hear
Watch the Throne
, they gon' be pissed off
Earth is boring to 'em, shit is making my dick soft
When you earn hard as me, eventually, you hit a big wall
Five, four, three, two, we need fuel, lift off
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (
All engines running
)
Now we gon' take it to the moon, take it to the stars
We don't know what we could do to make it this far
So many scars
We 'bout to take this whole thing to Mars (
Lift off
)
[Interlude: Jack King]
Twenty seconds and counting
T-minus fifteen seconds, guidance is internal
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, ignition sequence start
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero, all engines running
Lift off, we have a lift off
[Outro: Beyoncé]
Jump
Now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now we gon' (J-jump)
Now we gon' take it to the moon
Now we gon', now we gon' (J-j-jump)
We gon' take it to the moon
Take it to the stars (J-j-jump)
We gon' take it to the moon
Take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
Take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
Now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now we gon', now
