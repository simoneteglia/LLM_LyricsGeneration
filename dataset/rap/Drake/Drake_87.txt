[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, oh, gone on them)
[Chorus: Drake]
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me (Close)
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
[Verse 1: Drake]
Railiza, you need a... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
Howisha, you need a... baby with me, uh
And I'm takin' my time, just wait, don't leave
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No"
You wanna drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (Like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation is done but I'm not finished, no
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Champagne with breakfast while I'm yawning
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them)
[Chorus: Drake]
She tryna take it all off for me (Close)
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
[Verse 2: Drake]
I stay to myself, I'll explain myself, I can't play myself
Oh, first night, holy night, five in the morning, yeah-yeah (Yeah)
And it feels like you're mine, signs of the times, oh, what a time
Playin' it right, playin' it perfect
Laughin' it off, but I know you're hurtin'
Signs of the times, I say all the time
Taking my time, just gets harder to find it
But you're playin' it right, you're playin' me perfect
[Chorus: Drake]
She tryna take it all off for me
Tryna stay real close to me
I gotta catch myself
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
[Outro: Young Thug]
I bet I never disrespect you, darlin'
I bet you pardon me, darlin'
