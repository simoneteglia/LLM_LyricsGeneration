[Chorus: Gunna]
This FN hold choppa bullets, it's a AK in my hand
These boys a bunch of pussies, they no different than a trend
I bought the block, I own the land, split it with my twin
s
I set the bar, see what I'm sayin'
You know what I'm sayin'
What the fuck these niggas thought that I was playin'?
(I don't know what the fuck these niggas thought)
[Verse 1: Gunna]
What the fuck you pussies must've thought that I was playin' (
Playin')
Must've thought he couldn't get caught, they buried that boy in the sand (Damn)
Wiped that little bitch's noses (Slime), it only cost a couple of grand (Yup)
Find out he ever stole, I'm choppin' off his hand
Hot like a stove with a pot and the pan, we takin' ovеr the land (Ha)
I can go chop up a few blocks again, nigga can't wait to come spin (Can't wait to comе spin)
I'm out of the way but they pullin' me in, I'm 'bout to commit a sin
I took a lil' loss, now I'm here for the win, niggas don't want me to win
I bought a new car for my twin, this shit ain't just for the trend (Nope)
Sixty three AMG Benz (Skrrt)
I hit the engine, I put it in sport (Skrrt)
I'ma fishtail it and spin (Skrrt)
Callin' a opp, you can tell him, "It's up"
Know I'ma want some revenge
[Chorus: Gunna]
This FN hold choppa bullets, it's a AK in my hand
These boys a bunch of pussies, they no different than a trend
I bought the block, I own the land, split it with my twins
I set the bar, see what I'm sayin'
You know what I'm sayin'
What the fuck these niggas thought that I was playin'?
(I don't know what the fuck these niggas thought)
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Grave digger, big 4L, I'ma made nigga (21)
Say they twins, throw they body in the same river (On God)
Never tucked my tail, I went to war with real killers (Pussy)
I'm your wifey surgeon, dawg, I give her lip fillers (Pussy)
SF90 cost a M, dumped this Glock like Ye did Kim (21)
Sippin' on pimp juice, watch my brim (21)
How you a shooter? You ain't even hit the rim (On God)
Summertime killin' in Air Force Ones
When it get to winter, I'm steppin' in Timbs (On God)
I call the Draco, "Floyd"
Give him a uppercut, we hit that boy in the chin
Eight-figure nigga, I'm a drop out (21)
AK, heavy metal, rock out (21)
I'm in yo' hood, what you talkin' 'bout? (21)
Beat on my chest with my gun out (Pussy)
I put a house on your head (Pussy)
My money long, it won't run out (Pussy)
VVS diamonds, the sun out (21)
We just count money for fun now
[Chorus: Gunna]
This FN hold choppa bullets, it's a AK in my hand
These boys a bunch of pussies, they no different than a trend
I bought the block, I own the land, split it with my twins
I set the bar, see what I'm sayin'
You know what I'm sayin'
What the fuck these niggas thought that I was playin'?
(I don't know what the fuck these niggas thought)
