[Verse 1: Drake]
I been blowin' through the money like it grow on trees
I been fuckin' on a French bitch, c'est la vie
I just put 'em on a jet, now they all Italian
Way I'm dressin' tell I been to a thousand islands
This bitch lie 'bout gettin' shots, but she still a stallion
She don't even get the joke, but she still smilin'
Every night late night like I'm Jimmy Fallon
Cro shoot from anywhere like he Ray Allen
Crodie, turn me up
Crodie, turn me up
Crodie, turn me up
Got a fur on in Tampa, got me burnin' up
Shorty say she graduated, she ain't learn еnough
Play your album, track one, 'kay, I heard enough
Girl, thе driver downstairs, better hurry up
Savage got a new stick he wanna dirty up
Touch down in NY, tear the Mercer up (

Ayy, Bottega shades with the grey tints
Introduce me to her nigga, yeah, it make sense
Gotta put her on the team, got a great bench
Linking with the opps, bitch, I did that shit for J Prince
Bitch, I did it for the mob ties
Feel like seventeen, two Percs, frog eyes
And I never been the one to go apologize
Me, I'd rather hit 'em up one more time
Ayy, known the girl for six months, dinner up at my place
But I got these diamonds on my neck, so it's a blind date
All my niggas on the roads raising up the crime rate
Your name not ringin' out here, it's on vibrate
And she took a score, now shorty gotta hydrate
And he did some dirt, now my crodie gotta migrate
Prolly won't see him for some years, when I do, though (

Turn me up
Crodie, turn me up
Crodie, turn me up
Ayy, Crodie, turn me
Ayy, yeah, what? Crodie, turn me, what?
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
(21) In a droptop Benz like it's '03
(21) Had the shooters aim down from the nosebleeds
(21) Gotta get this passport, keep my nose clean (

Bitch tried to burn me up
Keep a Magnum tucked (Yeah)
I'll never slip (Never)
SF90 rims red like a poker chip (Pussy)
Rich as hell, still hood, in the Stroker's VIP (Pussy)
Pink slip in the glove for the ownership (21)
Limpin' with the .30 on like a broke hip
(21)
Red flag giving blood on some donor shit (On God)
All the opps get a bullet on some Oprah shit (

Went from Angell Town Estate to a big estate
Prolly woulda had a zombie on me if I woulda stayed (21)
Still a caught a case if I woulda stayed (Facts)
I been thuggin' all my life, that's just how I play it (Facts)
Still posted in the A where niggas fear me
Still gotta see the Gunners win Premier League (21)
Still gotta keep a gun that's always near me
And I'm down to hit 'em up
[Chorus: Drake]
One more time
Hit my line, you know that head was great
Oh, yeah, alright, don't do romancin'
One more time, you gotta run the fades
Oh, yeah, alright
One more time
[Outro]
