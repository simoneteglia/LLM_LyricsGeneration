[Intro: Offset]
So icy
Yeah
[Chorus: Offset]
(Hey) 'Fore I take a nap (Nap), ’fore I go to sleep (Sleep)
Count a hunnid racks while I'm praying on my knees (Racks)
Choppa with the 50, wicker make the bitch breathe (Wick)
Never snitching, never switching, nigga, nigga please (Never)
Throwin' up the G’s, throwing up a couple P's (G)
Ain't going outside, nigga, you don't read? (Who?)
Everybody having paper, ain't nobody greedy (Greedy)
Thotties in the room, I deny 'em, they cannot eat me (Deny 'em)
I keep talking 'bout ’em ’cause I'm missing Pistol P’s (Pistol P)
Need you on my shoulder, you a angel, watch the demons (Watch it)
Throw him in the pit, he screamin' "Ah" for hyenas (Ah)
Shoulda thought about it, watch your mouth when you see me (Watch your mouth)
Please don't talk, send them shooters out, pop, beamin' (Baow)
We ain’t tuckin' chains, we got too much Aquafina (Ice)
You can't come up in my trap, at the door, you get a screenin' (Nah)
When the money involved, it summon all the heathens (Ooh)
[Verse 1: Offset]
Jesus, please speak to me, I need some reason (Jesus)
She be teasin', I miss the one I'm kissin' on the weekend (Clutchin')
Only got one shot, you want my spot, I come and eat you (Ah)
So much money that the government think we do treason (Who?)
Policin', niggas pulling up to the precinct (Woop, woop, woop)
Anemic, diamonds walkin' through the mall, leanin' (Ice)
Me and the five like Kel and Kenan (Bah)
Shit was fucked up, we were stuck in Vienna (Stuck)
Mastering my flow, this shit is sick, pneumonia (Master)
My flow abnormal, put you in a coma (Rrah)
A stick and stoner, money make me horny (Oh yeah)
Pull up, stake banana cookie in the mornin' (Cookie)
Money that we makin' ain't regular degular (Huh?)
Roll up a Backwood and I been smoking on medical (Ooh)
Matchin' with the jewerly, with the cars, etcetera (Etcetera)
We go to war, we pull up with the metal up (Boom-boom-boom)
Checks, more checks, more checks, check the schedule (Phew)
Lord help me put up, my money up (Lord)
Pulling my strings, strings, get my bungee up (Strings)
I don't wanna hit the bitch, let my buddy fuck (Here)
Rollin' up the purple punch and it got a must (Stank)
Bases loaded, I'm the batter-up (I'm up)
I don't fold, I just ladder up (Hey)
Different caliber, different algebra (Du-du-du-du-du)
I got, money signs on calendars (Ha)
The Urus, real fast I handle her (Hmm)
No curing, the Instagram is killing us (It's killing us)
They not feelin' us (I feel it), tryna finish us (Finish)
My eyes are wide open, I see 'em plot (I see 'em)
I'm fine, I bought the Lambo' and bought the truck (I'm fine)
Denied them lies 'cause you fucked up (Denied)
I'm wise, I get the bag, double up
[Chorus: Offset]
(Hey) 'Fore I take a nap (Nap), 'fore I go to sleep (Sleep)
Count a hunnid racks while I'm praying on my knees (Racks)
Choppa with the 50, wicker make the bitch breathe (Wick)
Never snitching, never switching, nigga, nigga please (Never)
Throwin' up the G's, throwing up a couple P's (G)
Ain't going outside, nigga, you don't read? (Who?)
Everybody having paper, ain't nobody greedy (Greedy)
Thotties in the room, I deny 'em, they cannot eat me (Deny 'em)

Need you on my shoulder, you a angel, watch the demons (Watch it)
Throw him in the pit, he screamin' "Ah" for hyenas (Ah)
Shoulda thought about it, watch your mouth when you see me (Watch your mouth)
Please don't talk, send them shooters out, pop, beam (Baow)
We ain't tuckin' chains, we got too much Aquafina (Ice)
You can't come up in my trap, at the door, you get a screenin' (Nah)
When the money involved, it summon all the heathens (Ooh)
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I'm a young shot-caller, hit placer
Bad bitch taker, AK-slangin'-ass gangster
White flags, nigga, we don't hang 'em
Two gun gang, twin Glocks, nigga, I'm flamin'
Shoulda been a teacher how I get you white chalk
Loyal to the gang, I can never get bought
Stay up out the streets, you need to use the sidewalk
Bitches clout-chasing, I can't fuck a bitch raw
Rappin' all that rah-rah, nigga got robbed
I can see right through you, pussy boy, you not hard
When the gang slide, everybody get scarred
Slumped over, police thought that nigga popped a bar
We don't type on keyboards, we shoot choppas
Ask around the city, deuces, I ain't never copped 'em
Savage way too solid, I don't lie and I don't gossip
Came from the gutter, now all the bad bitches top me
Bought a new coupe and the top saying, "Drop me"
Dissing me, you better off just saying, "Savage, drop me"
Way too authentic, pussy boys can't copy
Knife tatted in his face, that mean he got a body
Two bad bitches doing the 69, free Shotti
Show my Richard Mill, I don't gotta show my ID
Nigga wrote a statement and he picked you out a ID
We ain't stopping 'til your whole gang on a IV
[Chorus: Offset]
(Hey) 'Fore I take a nap (Nap), 'fore I go to sleep (Sleep)
Count a hunnid racks while I'm praying on my knees (Racks)
Choppa with the 50, wicker make the bitch breathe (Wick)
Never snitching, never switching, nigga, nigga please (Never)
Throwin' up the G's, throwing up a couple P's (G)
Ain't going outside, nigga, you don't read? (Who?)
Everybody having paper, ain't nobody greedy (Greedy)
Thotties in the room, I deny 'em, they cannot eat me (Deny 'em)
I keep talking 'bout 'em 'cause I'm missing Pistol P's (Pistol P)
Need you on my shoulder, you a angel, watch the demons (Watch it)
Throw him in the pit, he screamin' "Ah" for hyenas (Ah)
Shoulda thought about it, watch your mouth when you see me (Watch your mouth)
Please don't talk, send them shooters out, pop, beam (Baow)
We ain't tuckin' chains, we got too much Aquafina (Ice)
You can't come up in my trap, at the door, you get a screenin' (Nah)
When the money involved, it summon all the heathens (Ooh)
