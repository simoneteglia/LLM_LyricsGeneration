Glock 19 in the booth, it's on the seat (Pussy)
Black Air Force 1s in the field, thеm my cleats (Pussy)

[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
Black and white gon' tell it, and you snitchin', pussy, I don't smell it
Real convicted felon, strapped up, loaded, shit, this lethal weapon (Lethal)
Bless you pussy niggas with this weapon, send you straight to heaven
Man, I pray to God you pussy niggas don't test me, I'm gon' bless you (For real)
Hope you niggas retaliate, don't tell them peoples or your mama (Damn)
Niggas like to dry snitch when shit get real, wanna go tell they mama

Fuck your honor, you know they try to give you a hundred
