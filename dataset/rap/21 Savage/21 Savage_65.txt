[Chorus: 21 Savage]
AK with the scope, nigga and it's real dirty (21)
It don't got Glock on the bottom, nigga it ain't no real .30 (Facts)
Dranking all this Act', it got my vision real blurry (21)
My uncle just turned forty-nine and he still serving
Got a bitch hooked on dick (21)
put a shoestring on my TEC (yeah)
I ain't never been no bitch (21) and I stand up when I piss (On God)
VVS's all on my wrist, my nigga,
white stones just to match my chain (My chain)
Bought a AP rose gold, AP yellow gold, nigga and I bought one plain
[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Go against the gang and it cost him (Cost him)
Made a diss song and I offed him (I offed him)
I take niggas off, I don't take losses (On God)
Bitch I pop my collar like the bosses (21, 21)
Nigga, pop your collar like the bosses (Bosses)
Nigga, flip your dollars like the bosses (Bosses)
Run off on your partner like the bosses (21, 21)
And I'm sending hits like the bosses (On God, nigga)
Savage keep that Glock on him, yeah (Yeah)
Savage think 'bout dropping M's, yeah (Yeah)
Nigga talking 'bout robbing him, well (Well)
Them .223s gon' make his face swell (21, 21)
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
AK with the scope, nigga and it's real dirty (21)
It don't got Glock on the bottom, it ain't no real .30 (Facts)
Dranking all this Act', it got my vision real blurry (21)
My uncle just turned forty-nine and he still serving (On God)
Got a bitch hooked on dick (21) put a shoestring on my TEC (Yeah)
I ain't never been no bitch (21) and I stand up when I piss (On God)
VVS's all on my wrist, my nigga, white stones just to match my chain (My chain)
Bought a AP rose gold, AP yellow gold, nigga and I bought one plain
[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
I got a lot of codeine habits (Lean)
I was robbin' at the store when I ain't have it (Give it up)
Still depend on the stick, it's automatic (Brrt)
Rich bitch, and yeah my bitch got a Patek
Reaching for my chain, cut his hand off when I order
Skeleton, 5980 cost a quarter (Bust)
Borders, I got Mexicans to transport it (Plugs)
Couple hundred thousand stashed in the dirt soil (Stash)
Still in the kitchen, off cooking up pollo (Still)
Fifty-five years old asking for a photo, ugh
Diamonds on the throat, I'm a GOAT (Ugh)
Margiela coat in the snow ho-ho
Pop the Adderall like a Tylenol
Playinâ€™ with the racks, volleyball matching haunted house (Racks)
Bitch, I'm from the Nawf and I've did it all (Nawf)
I was 'bout to knock 'em out but I put it off (Spared)
Stones in my mouth cost me twenty-five (Stones)
All these wedding bands on like I got twenty wives (Whoo)
I'ma fuck around and let the semi ride (Hey)
I'ma chop the block up like a samurai (Hey)
Nigga, you done told about a hundred lies (Cap)
Nigga cappin', you ain't never did no homicide (Cap)
'Bout that action, see me flashing like the paparazz' (Pah, pah)
And we deeper than the fucking Nazis (Hey)
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
AK with the scope, nigga and it's real dirty (21)
It don't got Glock on the bottom, it ain't no real .30 (Facts)
Dranking all this Act', and it got my vision real blurry (21)
My uncle just turned forty-nine and he still serving
Got a bitch hooked on dick (21) put a shoestring on my TEC (Yeah)
I ain't never been no bitch (21) and I stand up when I piss (On God)
VVS's all on my wrist, my nigga, white stones just to match my chain (My chain)
Bought a AP rose gold, AP yellow gold, nigga, and I bought one plain
[Outro: 21 Savage]
I serve raw clean, yeah, I drink raw lean, yeah
I got raw clean, yeah, make your nose lean, yeah
I serve raw clean, yeah, I drink raw lean, yeah
I got raw clean, yeah, make your nose lean, yeah
