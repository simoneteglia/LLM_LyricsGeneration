Still that same nigga, I just got a little older (Bitch)

[Verse 2: Young Nudy]
I got the stick on me now
Pull up and air that bitch out
Glock 17 on me now
Young nigga shoot up your house
What that shit you talkin' 'bout?
Look how that .30 hang out
Walk through the motherfucking crowd
Pussy nigga, shut your mouth
All of my young niggas killas
PDE, nigga, drug dealers
Nah, we don't fuck with you niggas
Get your ass slaughtered, lil' nigga
I keep them 5th's on my pistols
I keep a hold on my stick
When that bitch click, I don't miss
One to the head and I hit
Bitch land straight in your temple
I told you, "Don't fuck wit' me, nigga"
Shawty be popping them niggas
Shawty be dropping them niggas
Now they called cops on a nigga
'Cause they couldn't stop a lil' nigga
Right at the bottom, lil' nigga
PDE, Slaughter Gang, nigga
