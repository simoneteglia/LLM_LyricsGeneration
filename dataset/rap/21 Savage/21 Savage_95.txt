[Intro]
Metro in this bitch goin' brazy
[Verse 1]
Made it out the dirt, I was head first
A nigga used to rob, ayy, and I used to serve
Couldn't go to work, school was the worst
Pussy tried to play me, ayy, put him on a shirt
Lambo real fast, fell in love with cash
Fell in love with head, ayy, I fell in love with ass
Science, I was 'sleep, ayy, I fell in love with math
She was at the club, ayy, I made her take a bath
Ayy, I'm King Smoke, so I got a drum on the stick
Gang was in there, I can't put my tongue on that shit
He was talkin' crazy 'til that hollow hit his lip
Ayy, Big 4L, even the killers gettin' killed
All you see is Pateks and APs in my clique
Wе got all the bottles and the hookah in thе VIP
I might be a rapper, but it's thirty in this clip
Ayy, Zone 6, we get niggas buried 'round this bitch
[Chorus]
Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
[Verse 2]
My lil' niggas don't wanna trap, they wanna spin
Ayy, spin, fill the choppas up, then spin again
Free my dawg, he not ink, so why he in a pen'?
From Atlanta, not Vegas, but I still sin
Ayy, chain like a yo-yo, ride me like a pogo
She from out of D.C., when she fuck me, she play go-go
Used to sip lines, now a nigga sippin' Fours, though
Niggas rappin' gangsta, but they really hoes, though
Street niggas, streets don't talk, but you told, though
Rattail hangin' in the hood, boy, you bold bold
We ain't tryna hear 'bout all the bricks that you sold sold
They don't need a badge, but them niggas still the po-po
Focused on my bag, focused on my money
I done had some dark days, I done had some sunny
Niggas think they hot, I think niggas funny
Ayy, yellow baguette, VV-VVS's look like honey
All my diamonds pissed on, ayy, Andre Drummond
My playa won't even pull inside the 'partments 'cause they haunted
My dawg could've passed me the ball, but he punted
Got my turn, did a onside kick, that's how I'm comin'
[Chorus]
Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
[Outro]
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
[Skit: Morgan Freeman]
A wise man knows not to have a lot of enemies
The friction of constant conflict is a distraction in life
And left unchecked can end up being what subtracts him from life
If possible, all enemies should be eliminated
