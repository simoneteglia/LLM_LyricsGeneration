[Intro: Doja Cat]
Ahem (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, sheesh)
[Chorus: 21 Savage,
Doja Cat
]
That ain't something I would do (
That ain't something, that ain't something
)
Hell nah, let you slide like it's cool (
That ain't something, that ain't
)
Nigga, hell nah, fake the truth (
Yeah, yeah
)
Play by rules (
Yeah, yeah
)
Play with you (
Yeah, yeah
)
That ain't something I would do
[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I'm havin' plaques on plaques (Okay)
You niggas' streams ain't that (Okay)
I done seen a hater get whacked (Okay)
Hit him nine times, he a cat (Okay)
I grew up on the East, no cap (Okay)
Green Card, green tips in the strap
(Okay)
Keep talkin' 'bout where I was born (Okay)
Likе a nigga wanna still get clapped (Okay)
She sit on thе wood, no splinter (Facts)
New money like I got a printer
(Facts)
I ain't buyin' these bitches, I rent 'em (Facts)
These porcelain teeth, they not dentures (Facts)
Big VVS stones and they twinkle
(21)
I'm at Waffle House rollin' up Sprinkle
(21)
Let her ex call her phone 'til he wrinkle (21)
I'll pop at his ass, he a pimple
[Chorus: 21 Savage,
Doja Cat
]
That ain't something I would do (
That ain't something, that ain't something, that ain't something I would do
)
Hell nah, let you slide like it's cool (
That ain't
)
Nigga, hell nah, fake the truth (
Yeah, yeah
)
Play by rules (
Yeah, yeah
)
Play with you (
Yeah, yeah
)
That ain't something I would do
[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
Yeah, I would never lie
(Ad-lib)
I would never try (Ad-lib)
I would never holler at you, I would never cry
I would never start no petty beef, that do not fly (Ad-lib)
I would never put myself beneath one of my idols
I wouldn't submit (Money), I'd make you submissive
I can't fuck nobody man, but old girl need that assistance
I don't beeline to no D, like, I don't be like none these bitches
If I feel like havin' free time, hit the seaside with them fishes
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus: 21 Savage,
Doja Cat
]
That ain't something I would do (
That ain't something, that ain't something, that ain't something I would do
)
Hell nah, let you slide like it's cool (
That ain't something, that ain't something I would do
)
Nigga, hell nah, fake the truth (
Yeah, yeah
)
Play by rules (
Yeah, yeah, play by rules
)
Play with you (
Yeah, yeah, play with you
)
That ain't something I would do (
Bitch, it's okay
)
[Outro: Doja Cat]
Something I would do
