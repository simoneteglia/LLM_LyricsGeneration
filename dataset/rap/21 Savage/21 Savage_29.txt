[Intro: Diana Ross &
21 Savage
]
Am I really hard to please?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me (
Haha
)
My friends all fall so easily (
Pussies
)
[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Called the first one
Savage Mode
, my mood, that's what it was (21)
2016, we was ridin' around, beatin' niggas up in the club
I know she around for the money, but act like she loyal, I don't feel the love (21)
I'm so rich, get bored, might wake up, buy me a car just 'cause (On God)
Her titties is hard 'cause she spent a five, my bitch titties cost me a dub (21)
All my bitches got BBLs, all my bitches got butts (Straight up)
I ain't with thе rap beef, Draco pedophile, all of my opps get touchеd (Straight up)
We ain't never ran off on no barber, but we still be hoppin' out cuts (Straight up)
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', all my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', wipe his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', Savage never did no
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
That Clasé for your wife (21), that hookah for your wife (Pussy)
I'm Slaughter Gang, pussy, you know I brought my knife (21)
He was talkin' gangster (21), we caught him at a light (Pussy)
I let my young nigga do it, it was free, he wanted a stripe (On God)
Havin' my way with the cheese, I'm in the den with the thieves (On God)
I know that she ratchet, I could tell by the way that she wearin' her weave (21)
Smokin' on zaza, this shit came out the garden with Adam and Eve (21)
Chopper go fow-fow, shoot up your pow-wow, niggas tryna make y'all bleed (21)
Got out of line, spanked that baby, we had to rock him to sleep (Pussy)
Is it a issue? Keep me a pistol, I ain't finna diss you (Pussy)
All that pillow talk, I'ma have to send The Boogeyman to come get you
Chain hang low like a yo-yo, your bitch ridin' dick like pogo
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', all my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', wipe his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', Savage never did no
[Outro: 21 Savage,

&
Morgan Freeman

I brought a Hollywood bitch to Club Crucial (On God)
I was at the Met Gala with my shooter (On God)
Slaughter Gang, Gang, we don't do recruitin' (21)
Say you ready to catch a body, gotta prove it
Gotta prove that shit, nigga
Shit ain't no motherfuckin' game, nigga
Get your bitch ass whacked, nigga
Big facts, big 4L, nigga
Big Zone 6, nigga
We run the motherfuckin' city, nigga
Y'all niggas know what the fuck goin' on, nigga
Body for body, nigga, money for money, nigga
We skunkin' everybody
Fuck your crew, nigga, we'll kill your crew
Pussy, pussy, pussy
(
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
)
Are things better or worse the second time around?
Can we really do anything more than once?
