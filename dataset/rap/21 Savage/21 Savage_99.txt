[Intro: Faith Evans &
21 Savage
]
You are the love—
You are the love of my life (Precious little baby)
I dedicate my love to you
You are my child, oh
My child
(
Yeah, woah
)
[Verse 1: 21 Savage &
Summer Walker
]
I'm pourin' up Wocky in Greece
I came a long way from the east
She leavin' her cream on the sheets
My brother say he want a niece
When I'm with you, it's a safe space
Baby, you bringin' me peace
You know how it get in the streets
Ain't none of it shallow, it's deep
Yeah
I wanna cuddle for weeks
Your mama'nem think that you innocent
I know you turn into a freak
Don't really carе about your exes
Whatevеr it is, it could be
They playin', I'm makin 'em see
I know you swingin' them hoes like the D
I had to comb out the dreads
She fell in love with the braids
Gutter bitch, she cook and clean
And she'll load up the Ks
Your body got me in a daze
It don't matter the look, you get slayed
Her face card never decline
Man, fuck all that makeup, you fine
Better tell all them niggas you mine
She a dollar, way more than a dime
When I'm with you, I get nervous
It gotta be love, it's a sign
Yeah
I don't care where we goin', I'm ridin'
Fuck what you bring to the table
'Cause bae you the table, I'm eatin', let's dine (
Oh-oh
)
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
You know you my baby, you know you my twin
If they disrespect me, then it's comin' to an end
If them niggas play with me, we know that you gon' sin
Baby, if only you knew
How much I do love you
How much I do trust you
I pray these hoes don't make me have to prove it
[Verse 2: 21 Savage &
Summer Walker
]
You need a nigga to mold you (
I know
)
You need a nigga to hold you (
I do
)
He a lil' boy and I told you
Why you keep lookin' for closure?
Hit Eliantte and froze her (
Yeah, yeah
)
Now you a bear, polar
Play with her cat, Doja (
Oh
)
Throw that shit back like you 'posed to
Trust me, I'm takin' it easy
I really wanna get neeky
You actin' shy, but you freaky (
Oh
)
I want a piece, no Reese (
Oh
)
She sayin', "Bae, come meet me
At the salon, I'm on Peachtree"
She know I'm pullin' up BP (
Oh yeah
)
Ten Presidentials, no D.C.
She love Louis and CC (
Oh
)
No 2K, I got VC
Grab on that ass when she greet me
I heard of your nigga, he sweet tea
You cuffed me, don't ever release me (
No, baby
)
Talk about me in your stories
Bae, sub-tweet me
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
You know you my baby, you know you my twin
If they disrespect me, then it's comin' to an end
If them niggas play with me, we know that you gon' sin
Baby, if only you knew
How much I do love you
How much I do trust you
I pray these hoes don't make me have to prove it
[Outro: Summer Walker]
You are the love of my life
I dedicate
I dedicate it all to you
