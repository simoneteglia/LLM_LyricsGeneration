[Intro]
Step on a nigga in my Air Force 1s
Step on a nigga in some fuckin' Jordan 1s
Step on a nigga with this dirty-ass gun
[Verse 1]
It was one late night, I was cruisin' the street
We ain't had nothing to do, so we was looking for beef
Got a Glock in my hand and a stick in the Jeep
Stomping niggas 'round town, but I grew up on the East
Roll the window down, seen elbows and feet
I was kickin' up smoke, you was copping a plea
Yeah, we turned him to zaza, now his face on a tee
I be smokin' on opps, roll 'em up by the P (P)
Chopper keep shakin', the beat keep breakin'
No, I'm not a Muslim, but I don't eat bacon (Bacon)
Eyes look Asian, she say that she Jamaican
I bring her to the room, we just fucking, we ain't caking (Caking)
[Chorus]
Steppin' on niggas, steppin' on niggas (Steppin')
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin'), steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas, steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin'), steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
[Verse 2]
Got a Glock on my hip, niggas hippity-hop
He was dissin' on songs and that shit got him shot
Hit his block with a broom, hit his block with a mop
We ain't talking to bitches, we ain't talking to cops (Fuck 12)
Check the forecast, I got galore cash
Had them killers on your step like DoorDash
Fuck your baby daddy with his dork ass
We at the bottom, nigga, show me your extort pass
All the opps fans, they be imitating
Blowing gun smoke (Smoke), that's how we demonstrating ('Strating)
Hit his baby mama (Mama) while he had the baby (Baby)
Gave me good jaw (Jaw), I gave her penetration ('Tration)
[Chorus]
Steppin' on niggas, steppin' on niggas
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin'), steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas, steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin'), steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
[Outro]
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin', steppin')
Steppin' on niggas (Steppin')
