Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
When it's all said and done, who you gon' ride for?
Who you gon' slide for? Who you down to die for?
I gave her my heart, she was tellin' lies, though
Sleepin' with my guys, though, that shit turned my heart cold
I came from the bottom, I didn't have a dime, bro
Apartments with the blinds, bro, still got on my grind, though
I know my mama proud, everybody fine, bro
This shit took some time, bro, finally get my shine on
[Verse 1]
I done been betrayed, yeah, I done been backstabbed
Now I got my bands up and they who I laugh at
Riding in the Demon, no, this ain't no Scatpack
And we carry big straps, I suggest you back back
I just speak the truth, I'm not with thе rap cap
Can't wait 'til they free Turk, Mr. Push-Your-Shit-Back
Rest in peacе to Larry, Johnny B, and Tay, man
Swear I had a rough past, feel like I grew up fast
Go to war about my dawgs
Yeah, the ones who pick me up whenever I fall
All the pain I endured just to ball
I'd give this shit away to be with y'all
Standin' with you, throwin' gang signs, do it matter?
When them bullets start flyin', have fun, scatter
He ain't have no business in that car, now he ready to tattle
Just got shipped the diagnostics and he on a platter
Got on long sleeves, but I still bear arms
Rockin' Christian Dior, nigga, I'm in rare form
Savage ball like '97, '98 Jordan
Step back, shoot you in your face like I'm James Harden
[Chorus]
When it's all said and done, who you gon' ride for?
Who you gon' slide for? Who you down to die for?
I gave her my heart, she was tellin' lies, though
Sleepin' with my guys, though, that shit turned my heart cold
I came from the bottom, I didn't have a dime, bro
Apartments with the blinds, bro, still got on my grind, though
I know my mama proud, everybody fine, bro
This shit took some time, bro, finally get my shine on
[Verse 2]
Right hand on my Glock, left hand on her coochie
Cock the chop, hit your top, nigga, Bruce Lee
I'm the boogeyman, pussies can't spook me
Got your BM on my line talkin' 'bout, "Scoop me"
You know I got a soft spot for the hoochies
I don't talk to bitches, bitches talk the bullshit
I bought every pair of Amiris in the boutique
You know we want all the smoke, nigga, Lucy
I'll never fall off, I might take a break
You know either way it go, my family gon' be straight
Still in debt from all the losses that I had to take
When you out here tryna evolve, they gon' call you fake
I can't turn my back on the gang no matter what I make
I done took a lot of risks to make sure niggas ate
Superhero in my hood, I don't need a cape
I be lost sometimes, feelin' like I'm runnin' in place
[Chorus]
When it's all said and done, who you gon' ride for?
Who you gon' slide for? Who you down to die for?
I gave her my heart, she was tellin' lies, though
Sleepin' with my guys, though, that shit turned my heart cold
I came from the bottom, I didn't have a dime, bro
Apartments with the blinds, bro, still got on my grind, though
I know my mama proud, everybody fine, bro
This shit took some time, bro, finally get my shine on

When all is said and done
We can only judge, punish, reward, enslave, and free ourselves
There will always be doubters and haters, but they only have the power you give them
Remain focused, move forward, and never lose faith in yourself
Until next time, stay in Savage Mode
Because anything else would be too damn civilized
Peace
