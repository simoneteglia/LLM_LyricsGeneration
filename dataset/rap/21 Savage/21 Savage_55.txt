[Intro: 21 Savage]
21, 21, 21 21 21
I'm from out the gutter, middle finger, Zone 6
Turned sixteen and I got my first stick (MAC-90)
Fuck the other side, catch a body, sendin' hits (21)
You call that shit extended clip, we call that bitch a dick (21)
[Chorus: 21 Savage &
Offset
]
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers (21)
I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers (
Woo, woo, woo, woo, Offset
)
[Verse 1: Offset]
Mad Max with me, I'm Biggs (Mad Max)
Run through the Draco, we got cigs (Cigs)
Bustin' all on your bitch face (Ugh)
Make the bitch play with my kids (Hey)
Steak and shrimp, shot him in the ribs (Steak)
Baby bottles, ain't no bibs (Lean)
Twenty models all gon' kneel (Twenty models)
Breathin' with this water like gills (Water)
I done got a Lowe boat on the low note (Shh)
And I got an eighty-pointer that'll choke throats (Ugh)
Sipping on hi-tech, Four Lokos (Lean)
Wrist brr, fur coat way to go ho
Don't pass out, pop an Addy (Addy)
Won't smoke niggas in the attic (Smoke)
Rackades, the bankroll in the mattress (Racks)
I got, drip sauce like relish (Drip sauce)
Diamonds slippin', drippin', I'm a problem (Hey)
Heated my flow with the marble (Marble)
Stand on the stove, cook it all up (Cook it up)
Trap on the North with the Gualas (Migos)
I made so many millions, could have bought a helicopter
Do the surgery on the coupe like a doctor (Skrrt)
Heard that nigga poppin'? Call the goblins (Brr)
Gang, gang, nigga, fuck the opposite (Gang)
[Pre-Chorus: 21 Savage]
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless (21)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless (21)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Bitch, I'm mad ballin', all my diamonds mad flawless (21)
We got mad choppers, all my niggas mad cautious (Bitch)

I got mad dick, turnin' these hoes into mad stalkers (21)
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Hold on, let me kick my shit (Yeah)
Audemar drownin' my wrist (Yeah)
Put a double G on my kids (Yeah)
Put a double G on your bitch (Yeah)
I'll probably leave you before I leave the lean
Lil' bitch, don't play with my sip (On God)
I ain't even fuckin' round with no stylist
I got too much drip (On God)
You know you too much, bitch (On God)
You got too much hips (Yeah)
When she suck me off, she got too much lips (21)
4L gang, got a whole lot of choppers, lil' nigga
We'll shoot the shit (We'll shoot the shit)
Ran up a whole lot of M's, lil' nigga
I'm tryin' not to lose this shit (Facts)
Rims staggered, bad bitch, I'ma bag her
On my face, it's a dagger, private flights, I'm a jetlagger
Bitch, you ain't got no standards, where's your manners?
Hundred choppers, roll the window down, MC Hammer
