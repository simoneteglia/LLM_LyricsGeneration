[Intro]
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Count a hundred
[Verse 1]
Count a hundred, yeah, nigga
Diamonds froze, chill, nigga
I went platinum independent then I signed my deal, nigga
Young nigga, seventeen, all he do is kill, nigga
And I'm drinking on that mud like an oil spill, nigga
Gucci jacket, oh yeah
Saint Laurent, oh yeah
Bust down, cost a hundred,
nigga, that's a trophy
Balling like I'm Kobe, shoot you like Ginobili
Sitting on the courtside, never in the nosebleed
In the hotbox, yeah, with a hot Glock, yeah
In the trap car, yeah, get your block chopped, yeah
When it's time to blow smoke we do not stop, yeah
Pulled up in paradise, they got them Glocks out, yeah
Time to blast off, mask off like I'm mad, dog
Turned it to a murder trap then robbed 'em for a bag, dog
Police always fucking with a nigga 'cause I'm black, dog
Full court press, we won't show your ass no slack, dog
[Chorus]
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it, nigga
[Verse 2]
Another nigga dead, now the family's scared
Tryna duck the feds, tryna duck the feds
Paint the city red, paint the city red
Glocks in the mattress, choppers in the shed
Broad day smoke, late night smoke
All day smoke, bitch, we want the smoke
I'm from the Eastside where they cutthroat
Young niggas killing and they taking dope
And they taking chain, they not taking names
Gang, gang, gang, nigga, gang, gang
Pause the beat, free my niggas in the chain gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
[Chorus]
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it, nigga
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it
Run up them racks, I'm doing it, nigga
[Outro]
Southside
