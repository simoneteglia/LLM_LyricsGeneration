[Intro]
Cai, a noite sobre o nosso amor
Cai, e agora só restou do amor
Uma palavra: Adeus
Woah, woah, woah

Want it all, I won't leave a breadcrumb
Bitch, what? I thought a nigga said somethin’
Thought a nigga said somethin'
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
Nigga, all we know is— (Redrum)

We the reason all these niggas runnin' track, pussy (On God)
You ain't never stepped, you can't tell me a thing (21)

Keep my mouth closed and that's never gon' change
(21)
You get in the jam and go to pointin' and blame

I ain't let it slide, I was sharpenin' aim
Smokin' on my brothers, got his ass left slain
You know it's smoke, 'cause they ain't even take off his chain
Say it's up with me, your ass must do cocaine (21, 21)
[Chorus]
Want it all, I won't leave a breadcrumb
Bitch, what? I thought a nigga said somethin'
Thought a nigga said somethin'
G Block, all we know is redrum

[Outro]
Little pigs
Little pigs, let me come in
Not by the hair on your chinny-chin-chin?
Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down
Here's Johnny
