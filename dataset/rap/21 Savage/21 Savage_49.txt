You will be missed forever
(
Metro Boomin wants some more, nigga
)
[Chorus]
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago (Long time ago, straight up)
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on (I'm the one you counted on, 21)
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on (Shit brazy)
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on (On God)
[Verse 1]
Woulda never went against you ever (21)
I even tried to make the grudge settle (Straight up)
Yeah, I heard that you slept with a couple fellas (Straight up)
Still treated you like a virgin because I know you better (On God)
When she suck it, take my soul, she a whole devil (21)
Bought a Wagon then I covered it with rose petals (Skrrt)
She didn't think I was romantic 'cause I'm so ghetto
Got a Patek and a Birkin, it was fundamental
Then the situation took a U-turn (Fuck)
Foundation crumbled and the roof burned (21)
I ain't perfect, I was slidin' like a earthworm, loco
But I never, ever brought the dirt home (On God)
Man, we both played each other, you was worse, though (21)
Always blamin' me because I did it first, though (21)
You started sleepin' with your phone in your purse, though
And you had that pussy nigga fragrance on your skirt, ho (Punk bitch)
[Chorus]
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago (Long time ago, straight up)
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on (I'm the one you counted on, 21)
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on (Shit brazy)
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on (On God)
[Verse 2]
I had your back, you put a knife in mine (Now I'm scarred)
If you was finna lose your life, I woulda gave you mine (On God)
I sit back and reminisce sometimes (Just be thinkin', you know, 'bout the old days)
I used to drink my syrup while you drank your wine (My old ways)
Can't believe what we came to (21)
You won't believe what the fame do
We ain't together, any problems, I still came through (Straight up)
Heard he put his hands on you, that's what lames do (Pussy)
Got my first taste of love and I thank you (Thank you)
Savage, never let another woman taint you (21)
Fallen victim to my feelings, something I can't do (Never)
Get revenge on every bitch, even if it ain't you (On God)
[Chorus]
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago (F-U-C L-U-V)
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on (One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight)
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on (Heavy rain, thunderstorm, hail comin', fallin')
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on (Frown on the inside, laugh when the flash on)
[Outro: Morgan Freeman]
Truly genuine love never really dies
But lust, infatuation, and unrevealed attraction are all things that over time rarely survive
