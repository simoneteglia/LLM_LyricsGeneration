Metro in this bitch goin' brazy
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Strike like a match, knock him out his hat
Knife to a gun fight, this ain't none of that
Had to cut her off, she got too attached
I ain't wastin' time that I'm never gettin' back
Takin' less L's, makin' more M's
Put her Skims on, now she actin' like she Kim
Take it to the paint, take it to the rim
You look good on camera, baby, let's go make a film
[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Big diamonds, Big Puns, VS1's
Long guns, home runs, I'm the don
I can hang in the trenches with no one
Plenty switches with extensions, it's no fun
Givin' out spankings
Ridin' with lil'â€” 'cause he shoot without thinkin'
Baptize a nigga, send him home in a blanket
Upgrade a bitch and put some diamonds in her anklet
Better not get no throw up on my seat, I know you drinkin'
You ain't fuck no rapper, you a dinosaur, you ancient
I like fried rice, you better cook like you an Asian
Wrote a lot of verses, but I never wrote no statement
I been in them rooms, I never did no contemplatin'
This bitch wanna argue, I ain't doin' no debatin'
Seen her with her nigga, waved my hand, I'm like, "Hey, friend,"
Lookin' at the Shade Room, that shit be entertainin
'
Tryna turn an opp into a motherfuckin' painting
Wells Fargo where I'm banking, nigga
Heard your album sales tankin', nigga
My bros down the road shank you, nigga
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Strike like a match
, knock him out his hat
Knife to a gun fight, this ain't none of that
Had to cut her off, she got too attached
I ain't wastin' time that I'm never gettin' back
Takin' less L's, makin' more M's
Put her Skims on, now she actin' like she
Kim
Take it to the paint, take it to the rim
You look good on camera, baby, let's go make a film
[Verse 2: Drake]
6 God lurkin'
Come up off that bag for the boy that keep working
Dissin' on his album and it flopped, he deserved it
Come up out that booth and bring that energy in person
Got so many hits, it wouldn't be fair to do no verses
I could really go five hours in the stadium
What happened to that nigga claiming OVO? We traded him
Thought I was a popstar, I'm Slaughter Gang, I baited 'em
Walk around like Prince 'cause I got a lot of lady friends
Used to be in 'Sauga out at Sega City Playdium
Skatin' through this album like a Montreal Canadien
Way that I ran shit, you'd think I was Iranian
Niggas see my deal, look at they deal and now they hate the kid
Fuck, let me kick it basic
Niggas ain't got love for the boy, so they fake it
Crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake shit
But if I send a verse to they ass, then they'll take it
Shoot a video, arm around me like we aces
Or pop out at my shows, jump around with me on stages
Probably why these hoes love to shower me with praises
Might've fucked a rapper, girl, but you ain't fucked Drake yet
Yeah
[Interlude: 21 Savage]
Metro in this bitch goin' brazy
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Strike like a match, knock him out his hat
Knife to a gun fight, this ain't none of that
Had to cut her off, she got too attached
I ain't wastin' time that I'm never gettin' back
Takin' less L's, makin' more M's
Put her Skims on, now she actin' like she Kim
Take it to the paint, take it to the rim
You look good on camera, baby, let's go make a film
