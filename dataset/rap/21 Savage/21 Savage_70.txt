[Verse 1]
His wifey trouble, thot was finna cut her, I pulled out a rubber
Opps tried to slide on my brother, had to up that cutter
When it's smoke, we huddle, so many shots, damn near shot each other
AR st-st-stutter, Draco brown, look like peanut butter
Don't play tic-tac-toe or tit-for-tat, nigga, this ain't that (21, 21)
He was talking gangster on them tracks 'til I got him whacked
Glizzy with the switch and it go splat, ain't no ducking that
Y'all be smoking make-believe opps, we be smoking, facts
We be smoking gang after gang, cock it back and bang
21 4L, that's what I claim, let your nuts hang
We don't shoot at houses, we hit brains, y'all lil' niggas lame
Fell in love with them chopper sounds, Waka Flocka Flame
[Chorus]
Slidin'
Lookin' for the opps, they been hidin'
I grew up 'round drugs, sex, and violence
We turnt off they street, we heard sirens
Since a juvenile, I been wildin'
Chrome Heart jeans got me stylin'
Said he wanted smoke, now he joggin'
While you was in college I was robbin' (
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
)
[Verse 2]
(Brrt, bop bop)
Everybody run to they car (21)
You ain't gon' make it that far (21)
Walk down with an AR (Straight up)
We keep shit in the street (On God)
They gon' put it on the bar (On God)
Y'all niggas talking on pillows
All my Glocks got dildos (21)
Take your bank like Cee-Lo (21)
Draco bite, mosquito (21)
Y'all niggas corny, Frito (Pussy)
Kel-Tec hot, it shoot Cheeto (Pussy)
Y'all be talking that rah-rah (Pussy)
You ain't finna rob-rob me, though (Pussy)
He went against me, he gone
Step on him, I put my feet on him (21)
I just made an opp do the running man (Running man)
Keep an FN in my Cullinan (Cullinan)
Still ain't met a bitch that I'd cuff again (21,21)
Still ain't met a bitch that I'd kiss (On God)
He was talking crazy, he got blick (Straight up)
Savage keep a token, John Wick (John Wick)
Shoot him in the back like he Rick (Ricky)
Playing freeze tag, niggas it (Sticky)
[Chorus]
Slidin'
Lookin' for the opps, they been hidin'
I grew up 'round drugs, sex, and violence
We turnt off they street, we heard sirens
Since a juvenile, I been wildin'
Chrome Heart jeans got me stylin'
Said he wanted smoke, now he joggin'
While you was in college I was robbin' (
If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
)
[Outro: Morgan Freeman]
When your vision is crystal clear, they say it's razor-sharp
A focused mind is said to be like a knife, but the scalpel is wisdom
All one can do is accept that life is a double-edged sword
Stay on the edge
