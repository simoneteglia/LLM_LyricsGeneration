[Verse 1]
(
Hahaha
)
I can show you how to fit an M in a duffel
Show you how to fit a hundred bags in a duffel
Went and bought a Demon, nigga, just to burn rubber
Bitch, you bad as fuck, I might just hit you with no rubber
On that Slaughter Gang shit, bitch, we knife talking
Nigga, I ain't making no diss songs, we be white chalking
All my niggas dogs and we like to bite, don't it?
Glock 30 .45 with the mic on it
Going brazy, niggas think I need a psych, don't it
If I can't finesse 'em I'ma put the pipe on 'em
Niggas pussy, they can't wait to
turn to mice on ya
12 catch ya, they gon' put the blue lights on ya
(
Hahaha
)
[Chorus]
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas
(
Hahaha
)
[Verse 2]
You do a lot of talking, nigga, not me
Do a lot of walking, nigga, that's me
Finna open up a morgue, all this damn beef
Choppa with the sword,
Game of Thrones
, .223
Max out, Tee Tay down the road, finna max out
Late night, pullin' in the 'partments, all the straps out
Straps out, make the wrong move, get clapped out
Don't you think I'm slippin' just because a nigga rap now
Got a hoodie, man, I'm the boogie man
We on that bullshit, man, walk around with Uzis, man
This a Mulsanne, not a Mustang
Let the 30 hang, nigga, I'm so gang
(
Hahaha
)
[Chorus]
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas
[Outro]
Nightmare on Elm Street
It's a Nightmare on Elm Street
A Nightmare on Elm Street
Feel like Jason, Friday 13th
Hockey mask with the .223
It's a Nightmare on Elm Street
A Nightmare on Elm Street
