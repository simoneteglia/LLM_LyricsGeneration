[Chorus]
Get them bands, now run it up
Get them bands, now run it up
Stack my bands, now run it up
All blue bands like, "Nothing else" (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm good, I'm a hunnid now
Don't move less than a hunnid 'round
She ain't want me, she in love now
All my cups, they drugged-out
When she chill with me, she say that's a touchdown
She can't believe she gon' touch now
Smoking that herb and get bust down
I cannot get stuck now (Yeah)
Diamonds all in my bust down (Bah)
Big boy guap, it get left out
Don't want to talk about the check now
[Verse 1]
Off-White on my Nike check now
Tell Nike I need a check now
I don’t want more, I want less now
I'm the one keep them impressed now
Look at my phone, get the text now
The type of text you should check now
But you know I cannot stress now
Put my new one in a hex now
I'm the boss, I'm a T-Rex now
Basically, boy better step down
I'm the one paying for direct now
Hit that boy once, that's direct down
Silencer with no direct sound
She just wanna hear the TEC sound
You know I, like, play the cut now
I don’t have to do too much now
Go to my hood, in a rush now
Stand in the middle, we shut down
I’m the one with all the luck now
Stand in my hood and I’m bust down
Do you know the meanin' of bust down?
Even with luck, gotta tuck now
I got these chains, it from Elliot
A hunnid K on it, no cut-down
Avianne ring, yellow Yao Ming, Ben Baller chain still cost two-hunnid
With the cut-down, fuck all that, man, I still want it (Yeah)
That's how you know I get money (Money)
Balmains over a hunnid, no, I can't own, it fifty
Gotta watch, niggas tricky, these niggas can't trick me
Leave a boy even-steven, no, them boys leave you missin' (Mmm)
I was known for the drippin' (Yeah)
I was known for the business, yeah
I was known for, "If a nigga got a problem, we can get to hittin'", yeah (Huh?)
I'm not talking 'bout with my fist, got the Glocky, not unless it's a
Smith &, yeah

Yes, I'm in my own world, I am the president
If you wanna get to me, you gotta register
All blue cheese on me, not the type in the register
I don't really think it register
Nowadays, I'm not regular
I get all my drugs over the counter, pass the register
I fucked with her brain, so you know I can't have sex with her
Diamonds in my ring, so you know I gotta check with her
[Chorus]
Get them bands, now run it up (Run it up)
Get them bands, now run it up (Run it up)
Stack my bands, now run it up (Run it up)
All blue bands like, "Nothing else"
Bitch, I'm good, I'm a hunnid now

She on me, she in love now
All my cups, they drugged-out
When she chill with me, she say that's a touchdown
She can't believe she gon' touch now
Smoking that herb and get bust down
I cannot get stuck now (Yeah)
Diamonds all in my bust down (Blau)
Big boy guap, it get left out
Hate on me, get checked out
[Verse 2]
Heard that boy really got guap, and he went and just left town
Came back with the big ol' Lex now
Big old heart, feel like the best now
I can make that boy go back to his ho, and then blow it up, that is a letdown
Fucked them, but I can't just rest now
Think I'm worried 'bout being blessed now?
I ain't tryna be a letdown
12 undercover in dress-downs
Talked to my momma, can rest now
You want the drama, get pressed now
Met the real Drama, a letdown
They look at me like a check now
Used my head, I'm the best hands down
I'm the one fuck up they plans now
Boy, I swear I get you ran down
Me and my street always in Lansdowne
Free my boys that's in the can now
They freed 'em all, now they all hands down
She look at me from a glance
She look at me from a glance now
I had this girl in a trance now
Before she know, it in her pants now
Too much bank, got a new account
Big boy knots, that's a big amount
Bend her right over, put it in her mount
Don't wanna fuck, put it in her mouth
Diamonds on my neck hit like blue mound
Ask her, did
she ever sniff the white mount?
Bitch, I'm on the gang, turned ya' right now
Ecstasy with a 'shroom right now
Put the Perc in me, level right out
Don't wanna fuck, let her right out
I didn't wanna fuck anyway, just wanted her to see my new house
Want to see what her sweet tooth 'bout
Proceed to give me that mouth
Percy Miller, bitch, I swear I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Three years ago, Goyard wallet
Big Backwood full with Gelato
Light it up with a Goyard lighter
Lyrical dope ho, jaw ice
These niggas steal my flow, man, they liars
These niggas my clones, and they biting
Nigga like me, oh, I can't allow it
Bitch, I'm off a bean, bustin' off a molly
I can feel this shit in my body (Yeah)
[Bridge]
Keep it a bean, you ain't really ridin'
Keep it a bean, you ain't really slimin' (1600)
Everywhere I go, a camera on me, so I ain't really hidin’
Plus one turn a two into a minus
Bitch, I feel like I'm the one
Bitch, I feel like I'm the prophet (1600)
Know everything like the Mayans
I feel like old Hov
I feel like new Kanye (Yeah)

When I count new profit (C'mon)
