[Intro]
Metro Boomin wants some more, nigga
[Chorus]
Get knocked down, act like you never lost
Come back and win like you Ronda Rousey
Like you Ronda Rousey
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah
My niggas twist like they origami
Got them girls waiting all in the lobby
But my baby still right here beside, yeah
[Refrain]
This a gang, is you in or you out?
I put diamonds all up in my mouth
I feel like I'm part of Swishahouse, yeah
I was lost, and then, yeah, I was found
Had no money, yeah, um, I was down

We was already down
Nowhere else for us to go
Drive around in a Testarossa (Yeah)
Puerto Rican and she intercostal (Whoa)
Same girl that was on my poster (Yeah)
Damn, now I know
Treat my girl like I am Jay-Z
Treat my girl like she Beyonc√© Knowles
Money got longer, my neck got cold
My money get longer, don't need these diamonds

Get knocked down, act like you never lost
Come back and win like you Ronda Rousey
