Bought a new Spyder then take off the plastic

Rick Owens pants, they lay to relax
Crocodile Dundee, Don C on my hat
Alligator shoe on the pedal when I press it (Oh yeah)
Alligator shoe on the pedal when I press it (Brrt, brrt)
You know we stay vibed out and that is a fact
None of these girls got strings attached
I'ma get my blue cheese and I be dressing
I gotta teach these bitches a lesson
She fell in love, she saw a million racks
I made it out, I ain't going back
(
Ooh

Killing these niggas in all black
Look at these bitches, tryna broadcast

It is no one that is bad as you
We got new Pateks on Pateks, too
Made it straight to the top, got a whole lot to lose
Keep on asking me, she tryna find the truth (Shh)

Diamonds on my neck, not tucked, they emerging
Come on, bitch, now tell me what is the verdict (Oh, yeah)
Come on, baby, tell me what is the verdict (Oh, yeah)
My pockets big as Excursion (Oh, yeah)

She in love with the style, that's why she can't leave
I can never walk and beg on my knees
So my new girl, she black and Japanese (Yeah, whoa, ayy)
She's filling all of my needs (All of my needs, yeah, let's go, Uzi Vert, let's go)
