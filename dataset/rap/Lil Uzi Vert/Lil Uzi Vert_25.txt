[Intro]
Yeah (
Oogie Mane, he killed it
)
We tear it up, tear it up, tear it up
(
I'm workin' on dying
)
Yeah
[Chorus]
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Let's go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Woah)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Fact, fact)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (A fact)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (A fuckin' fact)
[Verse 1]
Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts (Facts)
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat (A fuckin' nat)
Just like his bitch ass, that fuck nigga will get clapped (Will get clapped)
Put a pause on that, you still broke, you ain't back (Yeah)
[Chorus]
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack
[Verse 2]
I could never change, gotta stick to my routine
I'ma hit it once, then you know I gotta leave
Got addictive personality, I turned into a fiend
Okay, my money sky blue, but my new coupe is slime green
My boys whip work 'til the white turn all tan (Tan)
Saw a minivan followin' my brand new Lamb' (Lamb')
I had a F and an N in my hand (And an N)
All my bitches ten
s, no, I do not fuck no fans
I was checkin' my DMs, found out she was a man (No, no, no)
I can't DM, never, ever again (No)
Lucien on my vision, that's the only thing that's tran (Yeah)
Okay, okay, nigga, let's get it
Got your bitch on my top just like a fitted (Let's get it)
I don't want it no more, then I gotta clip it
Balmain jeans, on the front got the zipper
My ice game got cold, got sicker
I'm a Leo like lion, I'm Simba
Stand on my money, I'm tall like a center
June and July cold just like December
It's too low, then the car, I lift it
I know baby girl miss my drip, yeah
Girl, your breath stink, need a spearmint, many (Yeah)
You need to go and take a minute
But your ass fat, lemme go for the finish
Overseas, I'm eatin' croissants
Told a fuck nigga, "Don't touch my crumpet" (No)
She a lil' thot, can't wife no bird
Four years, I ain't touch no chick
[Chorus]
Whip back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back (Yeah)
Bentley, Hellcat, new Lambo and Maybach (Yeah)
I can't talk on the phone, think my shit is tapped (Hello?)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Wrap)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rackie)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Lap)
Fendi knapsack, while I'm spittin' Fendi facts (Facts)
[Verse 3]
I don't want you back, you a thot, you a nat (Nat, nat)
Yes, that's them racks, that's them racks, that's them racks (Racks, racks)
Your jeans, they too fat, man, them shits, they relaxed
I got on Dior, and my skinnies, they all black
If we serve the sack, then we take that shit right back (Back, back)
650 for a hat, 6666 hundred for a jacket
Tried to hold me tight, but I didn't hug her back (No way)
'Cause she tried to snatch out my pocket with the racks (These racks)
[Chorus]
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Let's go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack)
Water on my neck, swim through that, that's a lap (Water)
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Go)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Rack, rack)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (That's a fact)
No strings attached, that's a rack, that's a rack (Facts)
