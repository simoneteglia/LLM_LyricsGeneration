[Intro]
Damn, DJ Plugg, you just killed it
[Chorus]
So much water on my neck might need a boat or somethin' (Hey)
So many different girls I got a load of 'em (Yeah)
Why you always hatin'? Go and get you some
Girl, why you always trippin' when you know it's love?
Walk around, Cuban link, my Patek is flooded (Blaow)
Now my pockets super deep, flooded with them hundreds (Ooh)
Flooded with them hundreds (Damn)
Flooded with them hundreds
What you thought it was?
[Verse 1]
And it's 1600 (1600)
Try to take my soul, my young niggas, they coming (Fire)
I remember when they said that I was nothing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't trust my brother, I can't trust my cousin (No)
No, let me take my time (Take your time)
I want every girl like I can't make my mind
(No, can't make my mind)
I spent 80,000 just to flood the time (Time, blah)
I don't wear no Hanes, my T-shirt Saint Laurent (Yeah)
I just made a whole bag from like half of a show
I still got some boys sad, moving bags of the dope
Yeah, you know I got that cash, you'll get blast on the low
Just because you knew my dad don't mean that I play you close
[Chorus]
So much water on my neck might need a boat or somethin' (Hey)
So many different girls, I got a load of 'em (Yeah)
Why you always hatin'? Go and get you some
Girl, why you always trippin' when you know it's love?
Walk around, Cuban link, my Patek is flooded (Blaow)
Now my pockets super deep, flooded with them hundreds (Ooh)
Flooded with them hundreds (Damn)
Flooded with them hundreds
What you thought it was?
[Verse 2]
I've been by myself, so I'm not losing health (No way)
I don't need you niggas, look like you can't tell
Can't do nothing around you, 'cause we know you gon' tell
Niggas I grew up with got a five-star room in Hell
Wait, 'cause they not loyal (Bah)
Can't believe we grew up in the soil (Fuck nigga, fuck nigga, fuck nigga)
Tell my niggas I got them with lawyers (Yeah)
Man, I wish I would knew, I would have warned you (Would've warned you)
Man, I wish I would knew, I would have warned you (Warned you)
They killed Ninety right there on the corner (Damn)
I miss Chico, I swear that's my brother (Damn, I love you)
Looking down on me right with his mother (Chee)
[Chorus]
So much water on my neck might need a boat or somethin' (Hey)
So many different girls, I got a load of 'em (Yeah)
Why you always hatin'? Go and get you some
Girl, why you always trippin' when you know it's love?
Walk around, Cuban link, my Patek is flooded (Blaow)
Now my pockets super deep, flooded with them hundreds (Ooh)
Flooded with them hundreds (Damn)
Flooded with them hundreds
What you thought it was?
