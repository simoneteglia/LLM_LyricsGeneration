Smoke gas 'til I levitate
You ain't never smoke that Jet Fuel (Yeah)

You like me, I will love you always until the end of time
It seems like that I'm always on that thin line (What?)

808s & Heartbreak
, Kanye with a little hentai
Samurai Jack on a journey, on my lonely, always rockin' Vetements
They asked me can I rap, man, can I?
But I chose to be a sharp shooter like Chris Benoit
Drivin' in that Lamb', I remember when my mom took me to PennDOT
Fucked a girl from Sweden then I sent her ass to Denmark
Fucked a girl from LA and I left her ass right there
Of course you rock with me 'cause I just came out this year (Yeah)
But I'ma see if you really fuck with me if you listening next year (Yeah)
Countin' all my bands up
