[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Me, I'm just me, me, I'm just real
Me, I'm that bitch that be footing the bill
Only a real nigga could cop a feel
Credit card blacker than that nigga Seal
Twenty-five million to broker the deal
Jewish my lawyer, he Kosher the deal
And I am still poppin' them pills
I don't give a fuck how you bitches feel
Jealousy, jealousy, that's how you feel?
I am still living in Beverly Hills
Tell 'em to chill, tell 'em to chill
Tell all them people my wrist is on chill
Bitches can't beat me, they ain't got the skill
Eye of the tiger, they ain't got the kill
Look up to Jada, I love her and Will
Bitches my sons but they not in my will...
The fuck be wrong with these bitches? (Woah)
The fuck be wrong with these niggas? Hey! (Kyuh!)
[Chorus: Soulja Boy &
Nicki Minaj

Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Tell 'em give a bad bitch her proper due
(Yasss bish, yasss)
What they say ain't never what they gon' do
(Yasss bish, yasss)
It say 250 on that fuckin' sticker
(Yasss bish, yasss)
Pinkprint hot, it should be in some slippers
(Yasss bish, yasss)
Niggas know me, yeah
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I don't fuck with you niggas, I own the Clippers
I own some homes,
I own my own liquor
Bitches is bitter, my titties is bigger
You bitches my sons, I need a babysitter
I am the dream, on the Dream Team
,
I am Olajuwon, I am Hakeem
'Dul Jabbar, I am Kareem
, I am the Queen because I'm a machine
You not ready, you not seasoned
Go against me, I say, "Fix it Jesus"
Thinking they hot, talk shit a lot
But when they shit drop, I say, "Fix it Jesus"
Oh, your shit ain't gold
Word to my bankroll
Real niggas ain't sold
Dropping my single in two weeks
The Pinkprint
album a movie
Bitches be thinkin' they hot
But these bitches be using that term so loosely (Kyuh!)
[Chorus: Soulja Boy &
Nicki Minaj

Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Yasss bish, yasss, yasss bish, yasss
Tell 'em give a bad bitch her proper due
(Yasss bish, yasss)
What they say ain't never what they gon' do
(Yasss bish, yasss)
It say 250 on that fuckin' sticker
(Yasss bish, yasss)
Pinkprint hot, it should be in some slippers
(Yasss bish, yasss)
Niggas know me, yeah
