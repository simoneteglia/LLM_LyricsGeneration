[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, llévame a la coco, yeah, a la coco
Ellos quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke ho, don’t fuck with po-po
Número uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things and let them things swing
Niggas know my name ring, and it go "ding-ding"
If I get a inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin’ 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, if I'm in the Gurkha, then they in the back of it
If I tell 'em eat food, then they make a snack of it
If they take your cocaine, then they making crack of it
If they yap your gold chain, then they make a plaque of it
No, we never lack on it, run up with the MAC on it
Put a couple racks on it, they gon' put the whack on it
She got the Nicki bundles, word to Stack on it
That's word to Brooknam (Rrr), that's word to Bucktown
That’s word to Harlem World, shout out to uptown
You know I shine on ’em, I spray sheen on 'em
That’s word to Southside, Jamaica, Queens on 'em (Kyuh)
I'm mad Queens on 'em (Rrr), run mad schemes on ’em (Uh)
I never scale back (Ah), the triple beams on 'em
My ice gleams on 'em, Wu-Tang creams on 'em
I pull up on the block bumpin' Biggie "Dreams" on 'em (Ooh)
Hunnid degrees on 'em (Kyuh), but I freeze on 'em (Oi)
A light breeze on 'em (Uh), I might breeze on 'em (Rrr)
Might do it like it's Christmas and light trees on 'em
I see the copycats bitin' my steez on 'em
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, llévame a la coco, yeah, a la coco
Ellos quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke ho, don't fuck with po-po
Número uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things and let them things swing
Niggas know my name ring, and it go "ding-ding"
If I get a inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin' 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting
