[Intro]
Patty, I see you too
This what y'all be wanting?
This what they waiting for?
Okay, haha, rrrr
[Verse]
Neck tat say “Onika”
I got more slaps than Aretha
When you lose the Queen, niggas friendly, dawg
It was just back to back like Wembley, dawg
Now you all the way back up in the Bentley, dawg
I turn lemons into lemonade simply, dawg
Old boy and my brother tried to end me, dawg
I heard they looking for the old me
A couple of you niggas still owe me
You asked for the G.O.A.T. so they sent me, sleeze
Tryna lay low, don't tempt me, sleeze
Thirty in the clip will be empty, sleeze
You bitches still my sons, learn your As and Bs
Leave the hate train in the station please
I was in the court, no Jays and Beys
Made her change her mind in the judge chamber, sleeze
The MAC's on the line, I ain't talking 'bout the PC
I'm the biggest fish in the pan, I'll do you greasy
All he gotta do is call, I'm in my T-shirt and my drawers
Face down, ass up, I'm already on all fours
Suck his dick through his shorts
Then I ride him like a whore
I mean a horse, I'm a boss
Yeah, I got the juice and I'm takin' him on a tour
Imitating Nicki while your ghostwriter dissin' me
Leave for two weeks, I got all of my babies missin' me
Never gon' fall, never not gon' ball
And I keep my nigga bustin' like a draco
He always come back, Big Draco
Still going bad on you stank hoes
[Outro]
Uh, haha mmm
Ahahaha, ahahaha!
O-kaaaaaay
They wanted the old Nicki
They wanted the old Onika, so
I had to, uh, get back in my bag
I might drop a freestyle every, um, week 'til the thing-thing come
The label hit me said they want the fifth thing-thing, I got in the studio, I did the fifth thing-thing
And then they say "You know, it's time to drop your single" I said "Noooo"
You know radio already tried to blackball a bitch
It's all good 'cause when you a legend, when you legendary
You shine no matter what
They get compared to me no matter what
They asked for the GOAT so I came through, bitch
But look, on some real shit, I'm 'bout to go on tour with, um, Juice WRLD
In Europe, shout-out to my fans in Europe
Uhm, I'm fucking three to four times a day, I'm feeling real good
I'm rehearsing for the tour
You know I'm sayin', pussy feelin' real good right now
Pussy like bald, like really bald right now
Like, because, I just be keepin' that shit so bald and so
That shit be so wet so, oh my, you know what?
Ayo, shout-out to my bad bitches, though
All my bad bitches know
All my bad bitches know what's good
I got you though
South side Jamaica Queens
South side Jamaica Queens, nigga
Heavy on it, sleeze
Hahahahaha!
But you know what?
Whenever I do something they say I'm the angry black woman
I'm just playing around and having some fun
Zamn Zaddy, eoooow!
