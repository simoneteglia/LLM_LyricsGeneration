[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I tell 'em that I'm the Sleeze, they tellin' me, "Okay, prove it"
I leave these bitches on read, so now they know that they blew it
I tell 'em I'm movin' units, my videos, they gon' view it
Spotify ain't gotta lie, they really streamin' my music (Woo)
I give bitches the crown, thеy fuck around and lose it, nah
I am the wave, I only wavе when I'm tellin' 'em bye
Bitch, we ain't twinnin', ain't fraternal or identical
When I'm around, bitch, you know you become invisible
[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
Mm, who wanna play with Nicki?
Got the power, I could tell my niggas, "Spray like 50"
(Brr)
Come on, bitch, I just put a milli' on my Richie
Minus like fifty, mine was nine-fifty, sissy
[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Fuck this club up, fuck this, fuck this club up (Flocka)
Fuck this club up, fuck this, fuck this club up (Flocka)
Fuck this club up, fuck this, fuck this club up (Flocka)
Fuck this club up, fuck this, fuck this club up (Flocka)
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, high heels on my tippies
Dolce & Gabbana, that's on my titties
Cop me Vetements when I ride the dickie
I still got the juice, bitch, buy a sippie
I will never slippy like a Mickey
Stay in your Tory lane, bitch, I'm not Iggy
I know that these niggas tryna bang like Chiddy
I am such a catch, nigga, throw on ya mitty
[Refrain: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, who wanna play with Nicki?
Got the power, I could tell my niggas, "Spray like 50"
Distribute about a million dollars worth of brickies
Told 'em to keep fifty, my cut nine-fifty, bitchy
[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Mm, give me my tens
Give me, give me my tens
Give me my tens
Then take away two, I ate, I win
Mm, give me my tens
Give me, give me my tens
Give me my tens
Then take away two, I ate it up again
