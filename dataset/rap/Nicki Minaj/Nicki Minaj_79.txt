NBA YoungBoy, let's go (

[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that, we can leave out
I leave the club, drivin' fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
[Verse 1: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
If you keep it real, say your needs, I'll pay the cost
Tеn thousand for to go shopping, ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
If it's a problem, get it poppin', blow the curb out
I spеnd the whole day wit' you, layin' in the loft
Not one, not two
Girl, you, I wanna see you take it off
Yeah, I'm everything you heard 'bout
Tryna see what your world 'bout, word of mouth
[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I wanna see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that, we can leave out
I leave the club, drivin' fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, throw that bag, I'm a bad lil' bitch, nigga
Got every ex nigga mad and they big bitter
Diamonds on the chain, blingin' off my tits, nigga
I hit his phone, he gon' curve her like a pitch, nigga (Ooh)
Word to me, pussy good, so he been hooked (Mmm)
If he got seen out with me, it's a big look
Word to Pop, body smokin' like a big blunt
Some big dick only thing that a bitch want
Left the lot with a big body, thick thot
All my niggas in the spot, you could get got
This that .40 vaccine, you could get shot
Since you wanna be stuntin' like a big shot (Brr)
This that pretty little joint from the southside
Fuck a quarantine, all my niggas outside
If I'm sittin' on your face, keep your mouth wide
Nigga, go hard, but be gentle with my chocha
[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I want see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that, we can leave out
I leave the club, drivin' fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Skrrt, vroom, she tell me "Face it," I face it
I say "This metal that you ridin', please cherish, don't break it"
You wanna be my girl? Be real, you get put in that placement
I'm in here with my boy Mike WiLL
I meant to say that's who made it (
Mike WiLL Made-It
)
Uh, ooh, came through swervin' through
In a brand new coupe, with some Forgiato shoes
Real nigga, Blues Clues
If you sleep on that money, then you lose
I don't snooze, you a fool, I'm the truth
[Chorus: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Can't do buying all the bottles, that you can't do
'Posed to be shining, but she notice that my chain do
Late night sex, I want see what that mouth do
Yeah, bounce that ass, do it how your mama taught you
Real made nigga from the trenches, do no pimpin'
I got seven figures bouncin' in the car, it look like switches, uh
Let's have a drink out, after that, we can leave out
I leave the club, drivin' fast, baby, what that speed 'bout?
