(
Go!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
It all comes down to this
I miss your mornin' kiss
I won't lie, I'm feelin' it
You're gone now and I'm missin' it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta let you know how I'm feelin'
You own my heart, he just rentin'
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pourin' out my heart, oh, boy
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I (Yeah, yeah)
I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (No, no, no)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh-oh
I (Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh)
I'm not livin' life (Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh)
I'm not livin' right (Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, right, yeah)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh-oh (Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah-yeah)
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Let's meet at our favorite spot
You know the one right around the block
From the nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Girl, just sit down, let's talk it out
One-on-one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, make you laugh again
I need to be near you
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Gotta let you know how I'm feelin'
You own my heart and she's just rentin'
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pourin' out my heart, girl

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj,
Chris Brown
]
It, it, it-it-it, it ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
That got me walkin' 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with him when the Lakers on
Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
But my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a wrap when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck 'cause all them bitches'll catch it
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (
Yeah
, let's go, let's go)
