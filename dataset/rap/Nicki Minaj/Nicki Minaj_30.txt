[Intro: Lene Nystrøm &

And I'm bad like the Barbie (Barbie)
I'm a doll, but I still wanna party

Rad, but he spank me when I get bad

I'm a Barbie girl (Girl), Pink Barbie Dreamhouse
The way Ken be killin' shit got me yellin' out like the
Scream
house (Woo)
Yellin' out, we ain't sellin' out
We got money, but we ain't lendin' out
We got bars, but we ain't bailin' out
In that pink Ferrari, we peelin' out
I told Tae bring the Bob Dylan out
That pussy so cold, we just chillin' out
They be yellin', yellin', ye-yellin' out
It's Barbie, bitch, if you still in doubt (Oh)

You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
