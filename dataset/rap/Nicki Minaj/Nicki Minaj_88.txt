[Verse 1]
Beggin' me to stay, and then you walk away
There's something that you wanted to say
I was in a rush, but you said you were crushed
And I said, "I'd be back, it's okay"
[Chorus]
I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish l didn't waste precious time the night when I called you
I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you
[Verse 2]
Listen
So close, but we were so distant
Wish I'da known in that instant
Ignored the hints or I missed it
I killed it
You'd always be in attendance
No flights, but always attеndant
Handwritten letter, you pеnned it
Them nights we wish never ended
Those rules that we wish we bended
Heartbreak that we never mended
Those messages we unsended
Best friends we somehow unfriended
Ain't care 'bout who we offended
Parties they wish we attended
Got drunk and laughed, it was splendid
[Chorus]
I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish l didn't waste precious time the night when I called you (Ooh)
I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you
[Post-Chorus]
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
Wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight
[Bridge]
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Yeah, yeah (Dream about you)
Yeah, yeah (Dream about you)
Yeah, yeah (Dream about you)
I still dream about you
[Chorus]
I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish l didn't waste precious time the night when I called you
I knew the moment I met you that I'd always adore you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd
[Outro]
Bore you
