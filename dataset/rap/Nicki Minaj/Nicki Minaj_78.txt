[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
On the real, nigga, I'm a real nigga, I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter, when I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real, nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
[Post-Chorus: Yung Berg |

Roll up on ya
Ro-ro-roll up on ya
Roll up on ya (
Yo, yo
)
Ro-ro-ro-ro-roll up on ya
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ay, ay, eight mil' on that new thing, tied up like my shoe string
Ain't fuckin' wit' you bitch niggas and that's real rap, but I do sing
Make room when I come by, ain't speakin', I'm dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it's a matter of time before one die
'Cause them dudes out and them tools out, all sixes like school's out
Niggas know if they talk slick, that I'm winter fresh, they'll get chewed out
'Cause them dudes out and them tools out, all sixes like school's out
Niggas know if they talk slick, that I'm winter fresh, they'll get chewed out (Uh)
This shit ain't regular rich (Uh), so they end up in a ditch (Uh)
I'm not a regular bitch, so when niggas see me, they jump on my dick (Uh)
He not a regular shooter (Uh), so when you see me, salute her (Uh)
Ain't got a knife in my hand, but I'm choppin' it up with some niggas from Cuba (Uh)
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
On the real, nigga, I'm a real nigga, I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter, when I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real, nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
[Post-Chorus: Yung Berg]
Roll up on ya
Ro-ro-roll up on ya
Roll up on ya
Ro-ro-ro-ro-roll up on ya
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, ask Jay who he married, eighty thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie got 'em aggy
These-these bitches is light-weight, I-I'm always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate, 'cause we move work through that Tri-State
'Cause them boys out and them toys out, still bangin' that noise out
You could get it in the wintertime or that May weather like Floyd's out
'Cause them boys out and them toys out, still bangin' that noise out
You-you could get it in the wintertime or that May weather like Floyd's out (Uh)
All of these bitches in pocket (Uh), I'm 'bout to make a deposit (Uh)
Tell 'em to go 'head and gossip as long as your house is the size of my closet (Uh)
Anybody I call, they picks up (Uh), even if they was gettin' they dick sucked (Uh)
These niggas don't make a mix-up, tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up,
tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
On the real, nigga, I'm a real nigga, I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter, when I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real, nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
[Post-Chorus: Yung Berg]
Roll up on ya
Ro-ro-roll up on ya
Roll up on ya
Ro-ro-ro-ro-roll up on ya
[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
