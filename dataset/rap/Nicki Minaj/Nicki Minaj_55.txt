I'm so fine wherever I go
Gakkeum meolli doragado, oh
It's okay, I'm in love with my-my myself
It's okay, nan i sungan haengbokhae
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh! What's good, Korea?
You know I've been a boss for my whole career
I'm 'bout to jet in the Lear
And put more than my hands in the air
Hands in the air, put your hands in the air
If you getting money, rubber bands in the air
Never gave an eff, they can cancel my care
'Cause if he look good, throw my pants in the air
I'm here, word to John Mayer
Body is a wonderland, my face is top tier
I swear, watch the ice glare
They be like I'm Gucci but don't shop there
One time, press rewind
Tryna come up off Nicki name, press decline
So much power in the mind, yes divine
Take your change, you'll never be next in line
[Chorus: RM, Jimin]
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Eolssu johda
You can't stop me lovin' myself
Jihwaja johda
You can't stop me lovin' myself
[Post-Chorus: All, Jung Kook, RM]
Oh-oh-owoah
Oh-oh-owoah-owoah
