[Intro: DaBaby &
Nicki Minaj
]
It's so on point, like it's so musically correct, I don't wanna clash
Like I'm tryna just put like
(DaBaby)
That's what I'm sayin'
(Da Barbie)
SethInTheKitchen
Turn up
[Chorus: DaBaby]
I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone (Brrt, brrt)
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo
That bitch drive me crazy (Uh), she gon' make me psycho (Yeah)
Everything I been through (Yeah), it's something only I know
Ayy, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone (Brrt, brrt)
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo (Ayy)
That bitch drive me crazy (Ayy), she gon' make me psycho (Ayy)
Everything I been through (Ayy), it's something only I know
[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Ayy, I'm a legend just like Michael
My bitch is ungrateful, so I'm out with my side ho
She gon' treat me different, I should make her my ho
She don't need no surgery, she don't got no lipo
But she got that ass, though, told her how to throw it right
She treat me like a motorcycle, ride me like a motorbike, vroom
I just took off, check the speed (Yeah)
I just made 100K off a show (Show)
I just made 50K off of weed (Yeah)
You know I like to play with your ho (Huh)
I choke her and pull out her weave (Huh)
I told her "Bae, I gotta go" (Go)
She beggin' me "Stay over, please" (Please)
I gotta leave, boo (Ayy)
I don't wanna mislead you (Uh)
I just wanna please you (Uh)
She looked and said "Me too" (Uh)
So I let her ride out (Ride)
She like how we vibe out (Vibe)
But if you blow my phone up (Brrt), I'ma put you in timeout
'Cause I'm—
[Chorus: DaBaby]
I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
That bitch drive me crazy (Uh), she gon' make me psycho (Yeah)
Everything I been through (Yeah), it's something only I know
Ayy, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone (Brrt, brrt)
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo (Ayy)
That bitch drive me crazy (Ayy), she gon' make me psycho (Ayy)
Everything I been through (Ayy), it's something only I know
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'm 'bout to tell my dude I love him, then I'm gonna dub him
'Cause to be honest I put my side nigga above him
Tell him that I know that he creepin' with that ho
That's why I'm fuckin' that nigga that I be callin' my bro (Bro, bro)
Middle finger, fuck a-you
Who the fuck is you?
This L is for you, I'ma take a W
Fuck on the dick, then I fuck up a check
He say he want a kiss, but I give him a peck
I said "Call me Aretha," I want my respect
When you niggas get stupid, it's plenty on deck
Ain't about to be sittin' home cryin' for you
Better get one in pink if you buy it in blue
All these niggas is lined up eyein' the coupe
Because takin' your spot what they dyin' to do
Ayo, open the door, give me my clothes
Throw me the keys, 'cause I'm taking the Rolls'
Get any closer, we comin' to blows
You get the picture, ain't talkin' a pose
I mean, who doin' it, doin' it?
Like we doin' it, doin' it?
Why you ruin it, ruin it?
Here we go
How you ain't know a Queen from a rat?
She saw that cheese, now you 'bout to get trapped
How you ain't know a Queen from a rat?
Ireland, you gon' be doublin' back
[Chorus: DaBaby]
I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone (Brrt, brrt)
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo (Yeah, yeah)
That bitch drive me crazy, she gon' make me psycho (Ayy)
Everything I been through (Ayy), it's something only I know (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I'm tryna stay up off my iPhone (Brrt, brrt)
Told my bitch "I love you", that was just a typo (Yeah, yeah)
That bitch drive me crazy, she gon' make me psycho
Everything I been through, it's something only I know
[Outro: Nicki Minaj &
DaBaby

Ain't no typo, ain't no Michael
(Tryna stay up off my iPhone)
Ain't a psycho, fuck your iPhone
(Yeah)
Fuck your iPhone
