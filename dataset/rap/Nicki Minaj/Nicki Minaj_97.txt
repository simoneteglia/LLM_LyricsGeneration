[Verse 1]
They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I'll remain a staple
My career has been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em, "Think pink"
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh, shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophesy everything I'd do?
But, before I continue, lemme thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne,
Mack Maine,
Baby and Slim came
Tezz
and E.I.
told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I coulda went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame?"
Lemme get up and go
Seven hundred to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm startin' the show
Man, I'm birthin' these artists
and I'm startin' to show
[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
[Verse 2]
Who I wanna work with? Nobody
Ninety-nine percent of them is nobody
Bitches actin' like they killin' shit, okay
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why these niggas goin' broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them ramen noodles
B-B-B-Bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy,
never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday at Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in there? 'Cause I must've missed it)
Twelve milli to kick my feet up
Get ready, this is the Re-Up
[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn a L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
[Bridge]
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding, baby
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your all for you?
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your—
Would you, would you, give your all for you?
[Chorus]
I feel free, I feel freedom (
Freedom
)
Why they mad? (
Why they mad?
) You should see them
Burn a L (
Burn a L
) 'cause it's crazy in here (
Crazy
)
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, (
Feel freedom
) I feel freedom
Why they mad? (
Why they mad?
) You should see them (
Hey
)
Burn a L (
'Cause it's crazy
) 'cause it's crazy in here (
'Cause it's crazy
)
Crazy in here (
In here
), crazy in here
It's crazy in here
