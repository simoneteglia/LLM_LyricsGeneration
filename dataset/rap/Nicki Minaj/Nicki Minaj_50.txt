[Pre-Chorus: BIA &
Nicki Minaj
]
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker (
Barbia
, BIA, BIA)
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
[Chorus: BIA]
Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old
Ain't gon' keep me 'round no ho shit, these hoes get too bold
I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold
I might paint my coupe white just to match with my toes, yeah
[Verse 1: BIA]
I can't wear the shit you bitches wear because it's cheap to me
It's some money at my table, grab a seat with me
Cost a ticket just to cover all my legal fees
I don't hang with jealous bitches, that's a weak disease
Ho, don't run up
If you broke and in my business, then just shut up
I invested in my body, bitch, I'm done up
I look good, I like to fuck him when the sun up, uh
[Refrain: BIA]
I put on my jewelry just to go to the bodega (Uh)
And I keep it with me just so that I'm feeling safer
Fendi on my body, but my feet is in Bottega (Brr)
Bitch, I'm getting money, give a fuck about a hater
[Pre-Chorus: BIA]
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker
It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker

Ayo

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I put on my jewelry just to suck my nigga off (Off)
Fingers on his balls like I'm 'bout to tell him, "Cough" (Cough)
Wait, hold on, Holiday
You can't give it to 'em dry like that
You gotta get that shit wet first
You gotta prep them for shit like that
Bring that shit back, bring that shit the fuck back
I put on my jewelry just to go out by the pool (Pool)
And I keep it with me case somebody act a fool (Fool)
Pucci on my coochie, I'ma make these niggas drool (Drool)
Higher than the moon, but I'm in tune, so don't run up (Brrap)
'Cause if you run up (Brrap)
I guarantee you ain't gon' leave looking done up (Uh-uh)
Some likkle Chinese bangs with the bun up
I got the crown, lil' bitch, you just a run' up (Oh)
[Refrain: BIA]
I put on my jewelry just to go to the bodega
And I keep it with me just so that I'm feeling safer
Fendi on my body, but my feet is in Bottega
Bitch, I'm getting money, give a fuck about a hater

Yo, Nick', these bitches trippin', let's send 'em a postcard
