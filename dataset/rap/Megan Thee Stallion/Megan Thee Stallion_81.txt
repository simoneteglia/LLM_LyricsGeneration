[Verse]
A lot of these niggas wanna hit it with Megan
He heard I work it out, roll it like a Jamaican
He call my phone when I'm on the road, see if I'm alone
Then I go up in the bathroom and give him what he want
Taking pics, rubbing on my tits, he think im the shit
Picture me in ya' bed, rubbin' all on ya' dick
Put that arch in my back and let you attack it
He like it when I make it jiggle, so I let him smack it
When you in it from behind
I'm looking at yo' face in the mirror
You be lyin' if you tell me this ain't mine
How you lick it up and down, must be tryna make it shine
Like a slip and slide ride, do it slow, then rewind
Name a bitch you know who fuckin' with my flow
Ya dick gettin' stiff, watchin' my videos
Record it on my phone then put it in slow mo'
I'm the real deal, no faking, no porno
Bitch settle down, hoe, it's money in ya' presence
He gon' act a fool when he see me in Giuseppe
Gotta tell him calm down, we in public, don't sweat me
Whisper in my ear, tell me how ya' gon' sex me
Pull up in that ooh, make a nigga say ahh
If he ask for my number, it's Chanel number 9
Only time I'm a freak is if I really got the time
If the nigga really mine, then he really won't mind
If I pull up late just to ride that face
He wanna be down, he respect my chase
That's why I gotta keep a special place for you
'Cause when I'm done in the booth, I'm comin' home to you
You could neva' take a L off a real bitch
I'm hotter then them hoes that you chill wit'
Up against me, bitches never win
If he ever hit Thee Stallion, he'll be back again, aah
