[Intro: Tyga]
What I need?
You what I need
(
Damn, Pliz
)
I need a freak
(
Mustard on the beat, ho
)
[Chorus: Tyga]
I need a freak, freak, freak
To rub my hair, hair, hair, ayy (Rub my hair)
I need a freak every day of the week
With her legs in the air, air, air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak
Who just don't care, care, care, ayy (Who just don't care)
I need a freak with a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)
[Verse 1: Tyga]
I need a freak, bounce to the beat, yeah
Freak ho, tell me what to eat, ew
Freak girl, tell me where to sleep
Swallowin' the meat, mmh, tell me if it's sweet, yeah
I like a freak, woo, do it in the car, leave cum on the seat (Ew)
Do it in the dark, I don't even wanna see (No, no)
Open up your door, I got a big ass key, yeah (Hah)
Like a free throw, baby, bend your knees (Bend your knees)
So nice, make her say please (Say please)
Like a lolly, lick it 'til it's clean
She looked at me, said, "Baby, what you mean?" (
What you mean?
)
[Chorus: Tyga &
Megan Thee Stallion

I need a freak, freak, freak
To rub my hair, hair, hair, ayy (Rub my hair)
I need a freak every day of the week
With her legs in the air, air, air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak
Who just don't care, care, care, ayy (Who just don't care)
I need a freak with a big ass butt

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Oh, you lookin' for a freak? (Huh?)
I'm the biggest one (Ah)
I can do a trick you ain't know make you cum (Mwah)
Big ghetto booty, bougie, choosy
Ain't givin' up the pussy for a dinner and a movie (Ah)
I need me a nasty ass nigga that don't care (Yeah)
Broke up with my ex 'cause I had the nigga scared (Bye)
You ain't eatin', what you here for? baby, I'm a nympho (Ugh)
Known to keep a nigga on rock like a Flintstone (Ah)
Real freaks don't trip, they cum and then dip (Yeah)
Treat him like party favors, I pass him like chips
Get my nut, then what? I'm back to business
A good lick and a trick, that's all that he is (Ah)
[Chorus: Tyga]
I need a freak, freak, freak
To rub my hair, hair, hair, ayy (Rub my hair)
I need a freak every day of the week
With her legs in the air, air, air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak
Who just don't care, care, care, ayy (Who just don't care)
I need a freak with a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)
[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ayy, I got a bitch named Ashley, she don't even ask me
Suck a nigga up with Britney in the backseat (Sheesh)
Brand new bitch, paparazzi think she Cassie (Huh, huh)
Tell her make it nasty, spit like Daffy (Spit)
I ain't Billie Jean, but the bitch call me daddy (Woo)
Diamonds in my ear got me feelin' like Gatsby (Ice)
House full of hoes, you could only imagine (Go)
Five in the morning, getting ghost like Casper
[Chorus: Tyga]
I need a freak
To rub my hair, hair, hair, ayy (Rub my hair)
I need a freak every day of the week
With her legs in the air, air, air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak
Who just don't care, care, care, ayy (Who just don't care)
I need a freak with a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare, ayy (All the niggas stare)
I need a freak, freak, freak
To rub my hair, hair, hair, ayy (Rub my hair)
I need a freak every day of the week
With her legs in the air, air, air (With her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak
Who just don't care, care, care, ayy (Who just don't care)
I need a freak with a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare (All the niggas stare)
