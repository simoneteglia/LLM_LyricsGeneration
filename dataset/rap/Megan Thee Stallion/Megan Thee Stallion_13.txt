[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Ayy, so smooth like the car I ride
Even ya best party planner couldn't catch this vibe
Big boss, and I make a hater stay on they job
And I be on these girls necks like the back of they bobs
Houston's finest, in the room with bosses
Make 'em all get ratchet in they suits and blouses
I remember writing flows in my room in college
Now I need global entry to the shows I'm rocking (Yeah)
Smooth like cocoa butter
My drip more than a puddle
They know that I'm the wave
Take over every summer
They must be giving Stevie if they ever had to Wonder
'Cause every beat I get on get turned in to Hubba Bubba, ah
