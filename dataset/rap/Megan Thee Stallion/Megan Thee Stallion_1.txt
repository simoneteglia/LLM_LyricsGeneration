[Intro]
I just wanna kick this shit off by sayin' fuck y'all
I ain't gotta clear my name on a motherfuckin' thing
Every time I get mentioned, one of y'all bitch-ass niggas get twenty-four hours of attention
I'm finna get this shit off my chest and lay it to rest, let's go
(And if the beat live)
(
B-B-Bankroll Got It
)
, ayy
[Verse 1]
I feel like Mariah Carey (Mariah Carey), got these niggas so obsessed (Damn)
My pussy so famous, might get managed by Kris Jenner next (Mwah)
He can't move on, can't let it go (Let it go), he hooked, nose full of that Tina Snow
And since niggas need Megan help to make money, bitch, come be my ho (Ah)
All of you bitches is weak, on the Bible (Weak, on the Bible), talkin' shit from where no one can find you
I can never be judged by a bitch that was dancin', makin' R. Kelly go viral
Ayy, I'm sexy as fuck, and I'm freaky (And I'm freaky), get whoever I want, eeny-meeny (Yeah)
Why the fuck would I stay with a nigga that's weak in the sheets and don't know how to please me?
Bodies on bodies on bodies on bodies
Say he fucked Megan and now he the topic
These niggas thinkin' they lowered the value
All this free promo, I'm turnin' a profit
Hate when a nigga be kissin' and tellin' (Tellin')
Say he a player, but he in his feelings (What?)
Bet I won't give up the pussy again
Shit, should've gave it to his friend (Ayy)
These hoes don't be mad at Megan, these hoes mad at Megan's Law
I don't really know what the problem is, but I guarantee y'all don't want me to start
Bitch, you a pussy (You a pussy), never finna check me (Yeah)
Every chance you get, bet your weak ass won't address me (Ho)
Bitches swear they G, but the G must stand for goofy (G must stand for goofy)
When the fuck did all the gangster niggas turn to groupies?
Everybody wanna kick it when you ain't a threat (Ain't a threat)
These niggas don't like me 'cause they know I'm on they neck
[Interlude]
Y'all goofy-ass hoes look so dumb every time y'all celebrate fake news, hah
Usin' my name for likes and views, I don't give a fuck what y'all make trend
Bitch, I still win
Ah (Hahaha)
[Verse 2]
Nigga, ain't you hear? I ain't scared of dick
Any man go against me, I handle shit (Handle shit)
I'm the Teflon Don in the courtroom (Yeah)
They be throwin' that dirt, don't shit stick (Shit stick)
All these lil' rap niggas so fraud (So fraud), Xanax be they hardest bars
These niggas hate on BBLs and be walkin' 'round with the same scars (Ah)
Real curvy, no etchin', niggas fight to get in my section (My section)
Don't speak on my body count if the dick ain't worth comin' back for seconds
Cosplay gangsters, fake-ass accents
Posted in another nigga hood like a bad bitch (Where are you from?)
I'm a big dog, bitch, can't lil' sis me (Lil' sis me)
Hoes get views when they tryna diss me (Hmm)
Make one move, got 'em in a tizzy (In a tizzy)
Killin' shit, that's why they tryna rip me
Still goin' hard with the odds against me (Odds against me)
These niggas don't have fans, they bots
(No)
These bitches don't have ass, they shots (Yeah)
And they still tuned in if they fans or not (Ah)
Allegations from the oppositions, bitch niggas just eatin' it up
These blogs get paid to lie, y'all talk shit and be broke as fuck (Broke as fuck)
Bottom line is I'm still rich (Yeah), do Megan bad and I'm still good (Still good)
Bringin' up who might've fucked and the bottom line is they still would
I just wanna fuck my nigga in peace, but all my old niggas still love me (Ah)
Niggas ain't hit this pussy in years, damn, I knew my shit was heat
None of you niggas was wifey material
None of you niggas was worth all the drama (Ah)
None of you niggas was hittin' it raw
And mad I'm not one of your baby mamas
Always got my ass out, always let my titties show
When I'm in the gym, I think 'bout bitches that I'm shittin' on
I'm way too fuckin' cocky to take him back if he been cheatin'
I can't let none of you raggedy bitches think that y'all my equal
Ever since I claimed the summer, all you bitches want a season (All you bitches want a season)
Ask a ho why she don't like me, bet she can't give you a reason
You know motherfuckin' well these bitches wanna sound like Tina
Don't you ever grab a mic and think that me and you competin', hmm
Ayy, bad bitch and the walls ain't bendin'
Post photo, name start trendin'
Why every time one of y'all Z-list hoes do an interview, I get mentioned? (Ayy, look)
I don't give a fuck who think what, you niggas is typin' for nothin'
On the internet typin' this shit to me? Write him a letter or somethin'
[Outro]
Say, bitch-ass nigga, don't type me nothin' else, don't write me nothin' else (Get the fuck out the comments)
Download JPay since y'all niggas got so much to say
Or schedule a conjugal visit or somethin', hahaha
Dick-ridin'-ass niggas
(Baow, baow, baow, baow)
Ah
