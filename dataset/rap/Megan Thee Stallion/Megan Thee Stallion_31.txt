[Chorus: Normani]
Diamonds are a girl's best friend (
Tiffany
)
Di-Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Southern girl like me
, I ain't afraid to catch a case
VVS' on me and I flooded out the face (Hey, hey,
Cartier
)
Diamonds are a girl's best friend (
Tiffany
)
Di-Diamonds are a girl's best friend
I don't need you, I got flooded out baguettes
I don't need you, all my diamonds drippin' wet (
Cartier
)
[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
I'm a super she-ro, bitch, don't try me, ho
Bad like a villain, I pop it and then I reload
All the best things in life come for free
But don't you think that applies to me
I do what I want 'cause I know that I'm hot
Ain't in a band, but you know how I rock
Don't need no clippers to give you a chop
Took me to dinner, then I took him out
I like it when you call me crazy
Long as you keep callin', baby
He think it's cute that I know how to shoot
Don't you be scared if I point it at you
Broke up with my ex, uh, dumped him in a text
Would wish you the best, but I already left
Date night with my bitches, gettin' real twisted
You know what you could do?
Give my ass a bunch of kisses
[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
I love me this much
My pear shape all dripped up
It's freezing in my bag, oh
[Chorus: Normani]
Diamonds are a girl's best friend (

Di-Diamonds are a girl's best friend
I don't need you, I got flooded out baguettes
I don't need you, all my diamonds drippin' wet
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Ayy, I know how to work a gun, I don't need a range
And I could take a hit, I ain't scared of the pain
And I don't really bang, but I came with the gang
And if you get too close, I might snatch off your chain, ooh
You want me to be a little more ladylike? Mmm
Come through with my girls, then beat your ass on ladies night, ayy
You don't wanna go toe-to-toe with my pedicure
Everyone you know be like, “Bro, how you handle her?”
Diamonds are my new boyfriend
So that mean I will never, ever fuck with you again
And I ain't never need 'em, so it's so easy to leave 'em
And I be doin' me, I ain't never tryna please 'em
[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
I love me this much
My pear shape all dripped up
It's freezing in my bag, oh
[Chorus: Normani]

[Bridge: Normani]
Look at all these rocks, rocks, rocks (So good)
Make 'em stop and watch, watch, watch (Oh)
All these diamonds dancing, know that you can't stand this
Bands on my hands, I got bands, I'm a bandit
Look at all these rocks, rocks, rocks (Rocks, rocks, rocks)
Make 'em stop and watch, watch, watch (Watch, watch, watch)
All these diamonds dancing, know that you can't stand this
Bands on my hands, I got bands, I'm a bandit
