[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo &
Megan Thee Stallion

Turnin' up on sight (Right now)

Pants down, chains on, I'ma leave her on ice (Ice)
Couple niggas might done had it but it still grip tight
If you gettin' to a bag, you the hot girl type (Hey)
Four hundred degrees, I ain't Juvenile
D'USSÉ got her goin' wild
Eat the nut, swallow my child
Clean it up, go get a towel
Shawty get to shakin', when she cream, cake batter
Tellin' me go deeper, I'm already in her bladder (I'm at the rim)
Hoes mad, niggas talkin' out they throat (Doin' the most)
Got the fire on me just in case you want smoke (Light this bitch up)
Open your mouth, I'ma make you drive the boat (

Best of both worlds, she Thee Stallion, I'm the
G.O.A.T.

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Ooh, you sexy, eat that dick up, please let me
I ain't talkin' 'bout no kids when I say, "Put it in my belly"
I'ma bust it open, spread it for that bread like some jelly
I'm the type to pull your card, so lil' nigga, please don't bet me
Huh, I got niggas, he got bitches, we don't trip though
Huh, hide the whip, so them hoes don't bust my windows
Huh, pussy good, he be beggin' me to get gone
Ayy, when I get up, leave it wet like some Soul Glo
Hey, I ain't fightin' with these bitches 'cause I'm pretty
Bitch, you mad 'cause your baby daddy suckin' on my titties
I be runnin' 'round his mansion with no panties like I'm Winnie
He don't dance, but this pussy make him bop like he Diddy (Baow, baow, baow)
[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo &
Megan Thee Stallion
