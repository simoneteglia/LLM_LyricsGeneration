[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
Ayy
Come over here, let me speak to you, baby
Talk to your body and teach you my language
I know you used to these women that's timid
See what I want, then I get up and get it
Hey, I know I get a lil' crazy, hmm
I need somebody to tame me, ayy
He love my lingo,
I'm wet like a free throw
And when you done playing let me know
[Pre-Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion]
I want you to know now
Baby, it could go down
I don't wanna talk about it, baby, let's just go now
When you talking to me, you gon' have to do me (Mwah)
Every time you think you're leaving, you running back to me
[Chorus: Khalid]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'
[Verse 2: Khalid]
Yeah
Started off right, I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before
[Refrain: Khalid]
Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it
[Chorus: Khalid]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'
[Verse 3: Khalid]
Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock
[Refrain: Khalid]
Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it
[Verse 4: Yo Gotti]
Yo, yo
I'm Yo Gotti, I normally don't talk a lot
I open the door and she walkin' out
A couple of things you should figure out (What that?)
You wanna eat steak or eat Waffle House?
I'm grindin' late night for the both of us (I am)
You live by the 'Gram, I don't post enough (Not me)
Relationship goals, I don't know enough (Goals)
I was in love with the streets growing up (Yeah)
I'm callin' her phone, she don't answer
I'm textin' her phone and she blockin' me (Block me)
Oh she in her bag, she cocky (Cocky)
You don't want her with me, then stop me (Stop me)
Her family be trippin', her ex a lame
Her friends be all in my DM (I see 'em)
Her daddy's a police and you already know me
I don't ever wan' see him
I'm Yo Gotti
[Chorus: Khalid]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'
[Outro: Khalid]
Figure out where we're goin'
