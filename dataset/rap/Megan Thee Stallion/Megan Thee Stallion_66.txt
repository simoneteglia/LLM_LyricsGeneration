[Intro: Lindsay Lohan]
You know what?
It's not my fault you're like in love with me or something!
[Chorus: Reneé Rapp]
It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me
It's not my fault
You've gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're like, you're like, you're like in love with me
It's not my fault you're like in love with me
You're like in love with me
[Verse 1: Reneé Rapp]
Where she at? (Where she at?)
What she doin'? (What she doin'?)
Who she with and where she from? (Oh)
Oh, she's this (Shе's this), oh, she's that (She's that)
She's a flight risk on thе run, okay
She's bad (She's bad), she's back (She's back?)
Yeah, I'm back, bitch, are you done? (Huh)
Excuse me while I bite my tongue (Woo)
[Pre-Chorus: Reneé Rapp]
I'm not on the same shit from before
I can't take this pettiness, now I'm bored, uh-huh
We can share, babe, there's enough for us all
Told you who I am and what it is, that's not my fault
[Chorus: Reneé Rapp]
It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me
It's not my fault
You've gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're like, you're like, you're like in love with me
It's not my fault you're like in love with me
You're like in love with me
[Verse 2: Reneé Rapp]
Get her number, get her name
Get a good thing while you can
Kiss a blonde (Kiss a blonde), kiss a friend (Okay)
Can a gay girl get an, "Amen?" (Amen; woo)
[Pre-Chorus: Reneé Rapp]
I'm not on the same shit from before
I can't take this pettiness, now I'm bored, uh-huh
We can share, babe, there's enough for us all (Us all)
Told you who I am and what it is, that's not my fault
[Chorus: Reneé Rapp,
Megan Thee Stallion

It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me
It's not my fault
You've gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're like, you're like, you're like in love with me
It's not my fault you're like in love with me
You're like in love with me (
Hmm
)
[Verse 3: Megan Thee Stallion]
I mean, who wouldn't wanna be in love with me? (Love with me)
I'm a mood, borin' whores gotta Pinterest me
I'm a stallion but they coming for me like Trojan (Ah)
And it wouldn't be me if I ain't cause commotion (Baow)
Bitch so bad, dudes thought I was A.I., ballin' like A.I
Stick to the motherfuckin' money like a stapler, stack like Jenga
Any pussy bitch get stroked like a painter
It's funny how the mean girl open all the doors (All the doors)
But I been told y'all, I'm the black Regina George (Baow)
Bikini top, booty shorts, Megan-core
You was hatin' back then, now you finna hate more
I got influence, they do anything I endorse
I run shit, to be a bad bitch is a sport (Baow)
[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]
'Cause I woke up hotter than I was yesterday
Don't care about no rules 'cause I always get my way
[Chorus: Reneé Rapp,
Megan Thee Stallion
]
It's not my fault
You came with her but she might leave with me (
Baow

It's not my fault
You've gotta pay for what I get for free
It's not my fault
You're like, you're like, you're like in love with me
It's not my fault you're like in love with me
You're like in love with me (

[Outro: Megan Thee Stallion,
Reneé Rapp

It's not my fault you're like in love with me
You're like in love with me
