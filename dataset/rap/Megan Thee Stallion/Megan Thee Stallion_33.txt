Boy
You know your bitch is not fuckin' with Megan
Your nigga not even fuckin' you naked
He put the tip in and then you start complainin'
If I get on it, I own it and take it
If it ain't good then I ain't finna fake it
You fuck like a rabbit, grow up and stop playin'
I need a nigga with stroke, hey
I wanna bust it on your face
He wanna see my shit squirt like he squeezed it
He finna die by this pussy, he need it
He wanna keep it like lock it and key it
I tell him to bring me my money then beat it
Give a nigga back to the streets, ayy
Ask your man not me, ayy
Only see him when it's time to eat, ayy
You ain't seen ya nigga, 'bout three days
Ask your friend bout me I'm the bomb, bae
Rap bitch all on the runway
Pink lemonade with the Bombay
Make the booty uh oh like Beyonc√©
I could make the dick dance, rock it like a blast
And he want another chance, but I know he won't last
And your last bitch mad 'cause I'm comin' up fast
I'm passin' bitches up like they runnin' out of gas
Your favorite rapper only use onomatopoeias
You don't wanna hear it 'cause you only wanna see her
I'ma show you how a real rap bitch tee up
Get up in the booth and beat the motherfuckin' beat up
Pissin' bitches off like a nigga left the seat up
Bitch big mad 'cause you can't beat me up
I don't wanna talk shit with ya or meet ya
Jealous ass trick tryna fuck up my features
I get my revenge when I drop all my pictures
I'm pretty like art, bitch, I look like a fixture
I'll get my revenge when I fuck on your nigga
I take that shit back, I won't fuck on your nigga
I'll fuck on his face, right in your place
Run with with his money, I'm goin' to Chase
Movin' these bitches right out of my way
Yo' favorite baddie be stalking my page
Yo' baby daddy be stalking my page
Yo' baby momma so minimum wage
Keep that lil' bitch from the fuck out my face
'Fore I beat the bitch up with a fucking briefcase
Full of them bands, full of them M's
Bitch, I'm on top of this bread like a ant
All of my hotties know Megan the shit
All of these rappers know Megan that bitch
Wonderin' how I'm this hot with no deal
Bitches offended by my sex appeal
I'm not a snack, nigga, I am a meal
I'm from the H, nigga, I am so trill
[Outro]
Ah
