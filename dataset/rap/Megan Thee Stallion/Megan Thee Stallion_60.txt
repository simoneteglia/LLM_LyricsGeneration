[Intro]
(
What's happenin', Chi Chi?
)
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
This ain't tag, why you runnin' from me?
Suck it while he cummin' (Ah)
When I do my little dance, get the Kelly and the Birkin (Mwah)
If he act up I don't give a fuck, I'm a rich bitch (I'm a rich bitch)
I'll be damned if a nigga have me cryin' in the whip (Yeah)
Okay, he sensitive when it come to me (Hey)
Talk shit like he runnin' me (What?)
He'll leave out and come right back
'Cause he know them bitches can't fuck with me (Yeah)
I don't understand how they go to sleep
And then wake up in my bidness (Wake up in my bidness)
I don't know what chain I'm puttin' on
My Cuban link
or my tennis
(Ah)
I know bitches gotta be losin' money
How they keep watchin' me winnin' (Watchin' me winnin')
Told him, "Boy, since you keep looking at it
Might as well go ahead and spend it" (Yeah)
Make-make-make a move (Make a move)
Baby, you know what to do (You know what to do, ah)
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
[Outro: Lil Baby]
I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
