Ayy, bitch, I'm up and my bag right (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pussy and my abs tight (Abs tight)
Always going up on my fee like a gas price (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
On these bitches throats 'til they get red-eye like the last flight
Way I dog these niggas, had to be one in my past life
Ayy, baby, without my name these niggas nothin', they should thank me
I'm a gangster but I'm such a fuckin' lady (Lady)
In the mirror and it's clear why they hate me
Up the price, pay me
