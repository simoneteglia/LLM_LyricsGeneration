[Chorus: Dua Lipa &
Megan Thee Stallion

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
)
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavour that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie (
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
I might take you home with this, I might give you all of it (
Yeah
)
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
Baby, I'm the sweetest, pussy is the meanest (Yeah)
Hot girl shit, but I'm cold every season (But I'm)
Know he got that pipe, let him bust it 'til it's leakin' (Yeah, mwah)
Booty like a pillow, he can use it while he's sleepin' (Look)
Don't be goin' through my phone 'cause that's the old me (Old me)
Ain't the only one tryna be my one and only (Tryna)
Real thick, movin' slow, that body like codeine
He a player, but for Megan, he cuttin' the whole team (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
That body lookin' nice (Lookin' nice)
I got cake and I know he want a slice
I wish a nigga would try to put me on ice (Brrr)
I ain't never had to chase dick in my life (Dick in my life)
I like that nasty, that freaky stuff (Freaky stuff)
Slip under my bed and keep me up (Hey)
That Hansel and Gretel, let him eat me up (Ah)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[Chorus: Dua Lipa &
Megan Thee Stallion

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (
Uh-huh

Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back (
Ah

I got the flavour that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie
I might take you home with this, I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie (
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
You got me hung up from across the room
I'm so high that I'm on another altitude
And on my cloud, I got some space for you
Got a taste for you, ayy
[Verse 3: Megan Thee Stallion]
More bounce to the ounce, pick it up, put it down (Woah)
Wanna put his Nutty Buddy in my Fudge Round (Bow)
Pussy tighter than a bitch, he ain't had it like this
Toes curling like they're throwing gang signs on Crip (On Crip)
One thing about me, I ain't takin' no shit
He whipped
, I know it's pissin' off his old bitch
Cesar Millan, I got his ass trained (I got his ass trained)
Tryna let a dog know who really run things (Huh, ah)
