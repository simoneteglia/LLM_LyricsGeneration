Ay, ay
Okay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Runnin' from his bitch, he gon' come when I call
If it ain’t 'bout money, then you know I ain’t involved
Worried 'bout these motherfuckin' haters? Not at all
Nine times outta ten, I’m the realest bitch you know
If you ain’t wanna pimp, then whatchu fuckin' with me for?
If you ballin and you know it, then let the money show
If he actin' scared to spend it, I'ma show him to the door
Ok now shake wid it, shake the shake wid it
And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it
And when I pop it, he get stiffer than some fake titties
And don’t be worried 'bout who I’m fuckin', cos you can’t hit it
Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
If I’m wit yo’ Daddy then you know we at the mall
If I’m wit a nigga then you know I’m in them jaws
How you let a broke nigga talk you out the drawers?
I don’t even chase liquor, why would I chase a nigga?
He say I should be nicer, well your dick should be bigger
He said it better be good, by the way that you’re braggin'
I hit him back and told him, well that just depend who you askin'
I got a ex that say he gon' leave his new bitch whenever I call him
Got a ex that say that every time he see me there’s gon' be problems
Got a ex that’s on his homeboy IG, tryna stalk me now
Got a ex that miss me so bad, probably praying for me now
Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
In the Gucci store, finna tear that bitch down
Money on my phone yeah like collect-calls
Pussy like a drug and he havin' withdrawals
Money, money, I need mo'
Get it, get it, watch me go
I be outdoing these bitches
I’m like Michael, they Tito
Not the one to compete with
You don’t want it with me bitch
​
göt2b Glued can't save you
When I come for your hairdo
Got the moves like I’m Ryu
Yellow diamonds, Pikachu
When I switch my hair to blonde, finna turn up like Goku
I go crazy in this bitch, I go crazy in the booth
He go crazy when he see me, and his girl go crazy too
And this pussy so wet, might have to eat it with a spoon
I was in bikini bottoms 'cause I got that goo lagoon
I don’t wanna fuck him if he tellin' me what he do not
I will come over and spin it on your head like bantu knots
Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Bitch I’m off the Henn', so you know I’m off the wall
Bitch I’m not the one so watch your motherfuckin' mouth
Hot Girl Meg from the motherfuckin' south
Ahh
[Beat Change]
Bitch I look good than a motherfucker
I be with niggas that’s hood than a motherfucker
We will come right in this bitch and then tear it up
I’m from a city where niggas ain’t sharin' none
I had to figure shit out on my own
Mama at work, and my Daddy ain’t home
Don’t listen to shit because bitch I been grown
I got a temper so hoe watch your tone
He tryna dog me but I got the bone
Don’t got the money? Don’t pick up the phone
He can talk down, he can say what he want
He was just mad he ain’t get what he want
Hoes love to try 'cause they think that I won’t
Bitch I will run through your shit like a cone
Bitch I’m mad, ain't get what I want
I’m lookin' for somebody take it out on
You wanna talk or you wanna get to it?
Cos when it come down to who 'bout it, I’m fluent
Bitch you was hatin' on me and I knew it
A hoe wanna give me some beef, I chew it
Giving these rappers the business, I’m suited
These bitches look better than me when they muted
Tellin these niggas that you got that water
But you ain’t gon' tell 'em your shit is polluted, uhh
