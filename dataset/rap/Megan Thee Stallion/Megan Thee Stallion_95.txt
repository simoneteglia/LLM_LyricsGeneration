[Intro: Megan Thee Stallion]
Ayy
[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
I'm who every nigga wife fear, thick-thighed nightmare
I'm the boogie-bitch, ho, I'm every nigga type, yeah
Jewelry so cold, gave these broke bitches goosebumps
White Ghost rollin' through the hood, look like Klu Klux
Say my name like Candyman, and bitch, you know I'm there
These hoes wish they saw me when they lookin' in the mirror
Red bottoms on my feet, Bloody Mary on my toes
Every time I pop out, it get scary for you hoes
[Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion]
Yeah, it gеt scary for you hoes
Every time I pop out, it gеt scary for you hoes
Red bottom on my feet
,
Bloody Mary on my toes
Every time I pop out, it get scary for you hoes
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
I put niggas on they knees, I put bitches on they feet
Only time my buttons pushed is when I'm pressin' on my keys
Six-hundred on my chain, yes, K, yes, Gs
Lookin' for a bitch to play with, then you better Ask Jeeves
I know goons, I know goblins, shootin' and robbin'
Mask all year, nigga, who want a problem?
I'm a dog-ass bitch, Ace of Spades when I piss
Prenup' just to fuck, bottom line is I'm rich
And that ass like a pumpkin, welcome to the dungeon
Where the niggas at? Tryna turn this into somethin'
Know a bitch like me is a very rare sight
And throw that ass back, hear the thunder and lightnin', ah
[Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion &
Rico Nasty

Yeah, it get scary for you hoes
Every time I pop out, it get scary for you hoes
Red bottom on my feet, Bloody Mary on my toes
Every time I pop out, it get scary for you hoes (

[Verse 3: Rico Nasty]
In my Jeep, creepin' on a lame-ass nigga
On my Monster Jam shit (Haha), ridin' in a Grave Digger (Yeah, yeah)
Keep talkin' on my name and we gon' dig a grave with you
Zombie-ass bitch (Yeah, yeah), nigga gave me brain for dinner (Yummy)
I want it, then I got it (Got it), my mansion lookin' haunted
Doc Marten, fishnet stockings, my bitches goons and goblins (Goblins)
This ain't no trick or treat (Uh-huh), but your nigga trick on me
If it ain't more than a thousand, I won't put it on my feet, bitch
Wh— When I pop out, it get scary like a cemetery (Cemetery)
I'm fresh to death, I need a hearse when I go shoppin', baby (Yeah)
He like me 'cause I'm godly (Yeah), Texas chainsaw in the whip
Shout out Megan the hottie (Let's go), yeah, I be the hottest topic (Rico)
[Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion]
Yeah, it get scary for you hoes
Every time I pop out, it get scary for you hoes
Red bottom on my feet, Bloody Mary on my toes
Every time I pop out, it get scary for you hoes
