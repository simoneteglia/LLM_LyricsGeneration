[Intro: VickeeLo]
If his name on it, then mine right beside it
Real fucking ride or die
[Verse 1: Megan Thee Stallion]
I'ma ride that dick like a stolen car
I got the best pussy that you had thus far
Which bitch you know goin' hard as me?
I'ma ride or die and I don't need the keys (
Fuck it up
)
I'm finna bounce that ass and drop that ass and pop it like a shootout
I pull them panties down, he smilin' like they brought the food out
I hop up on that face and make my
hips go like a luau
(Ah)
I showed you I'm a gangster, now I wanna see what you 'bout (
Fuck it up
)
[Refrain: Megan Thee Stallion]
I ain't shy, bust it wide 'cause I been that bitch (Ah)
Hey, ayy
I ain't shy, bust it wide 'cause I been that bitch, hey (
Fuck it up
)
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Now don't be playin' with a real bitch
Like I won't step back and click-clack and hit the killswitch
Like it ain't problems in my life I gotta deal with
Like I won't take 'em out on you real quick, ayy (
Fuck it up
)
[Pre-Chorus: Megan Thee Stallion]
I ain't scared, I'ma pop that shit
I ain't shy, bust it wide 'cause I been that bitch (Ah)

Bend it, bust it open, bend, bend it, bust it open
Bend it, bust it open, bend, bend it, bust it open

Bounce that ass and drop that ass and pop it like a shootout
