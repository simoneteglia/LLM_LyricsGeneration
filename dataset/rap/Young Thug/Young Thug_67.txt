[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Rockstar, yellow bitch like corn (Like corn)
Went to MIA, turned orange
(Turned orange)
Pull up new Lam', no insurance (Skrrt)
Bad bitch foreign (Foreign)
Overseas money when a nigga tourin' (I'm tourin')
She suck it up and her eyes start pourin' (Suck it up)
Let me strap my leg up like George
Woah, let's go (Let's go, let's go)
It's no way that I'm fightin' you (No way)
She moan like a prostitute (Bitch)
She ain't got a lot to lose (No, no)
No, no, at all
Yes, my Rollie face is green
Slime, his Rollie face is red
Gunna Rollie face is blue
(No cap)
Let's go, for sure, for sure
I could never make that girl my ho
'Cause she play with her nose (Ew)
Put diamonds on my wrist, my hands (Bblaow)
My neck, my nose (My nose, my nose)
I ran out of space, put it on my ankle
Put it on my toes

I jumped in the crowd and I felt so proud (Yeah)
I kill 'bout my dawg, and that's a hands-down (Hands-down)
Uzi a real king (Yeah), somebody pass him a crown (Yeah)
I had a dream 'bout lean (Lean), woke up, poured an ounce (Ah)
I just bought a car (Skrrt), put it in my mouth (Yeah)
Hundred fit this large (Racks), and I still can't talk (Can't talk)
I supply this town, I ranned out of rounds (Yeah)
I took off the Rollie (Woah), and put it on the ground (Woo)
Took the words out my mouth (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Yung Kayo]
Put Amari on her every day (Every day)
And I'm on the water just like a crate' (Crater)
The semen sittin' on her face, marinate (Marinate)
Stomp out an opp like a parasite
I got the heater, two hundred in Fahrenheit (Hot)
I got a European bitch, I'm Barry White
Roll in the bitch like a motherfuckin' ramp height
I keep at least ten thousand on my lap tight
And them bitches just wanna fuck me 'cause my status
I let off thirty-twos just like Magic
Told the bitch give me roof 'til I drop it
But we shoot at your whole head, we ain't croppin' it
I'ma air it out just like the laundromat (Gang)
Walkin' with whole bags, money counter, man
And my neck water, like the fountain, man (Woah)
And we got zero losses like the pointer, man (Point)
Get to the money, you know it's important, man
[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert &
Young Thug

Uzi, I am proud of you
Uzi, I'm so proud of you
