[Intro]
When you were worrying about pissing on your fuckin' self, I was a stoner
Band gang
Dun Deal on the tra-a-a-ack
Way back in 90-fucking'-4, when I was six or seven
Ayy, ayy, this that stoner music, nigga
Stoner! (This my damn bit!)
Stoner (Let's get it)
[Chorus]
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (I'm a stoner)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (Stoner!)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner
[Post-Chorus]
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss
I just drank with YSL just like a f— boss
Just like a f— boss, just like a, ch-ch! Boss, boss!
[Verse 1]
Thugger Thugger, you
I want Michael Jackson land, ooh
Oh, I'ma cash out (And what?)
I'm high as hell, ain't got no satellites on me (Moon)
I tell that bitch, I feel like Fabo (What?)
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo (Ha)
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo (Like Fabo)
I feel like Fabo, I feel just like Fabo (Fabo)
I'm back at it (What?), Juugman voice (Yung Ralph, hahaha, hehe)
Bankhead
Hear my song 'way from YTC
ROB, SMM, now we YSL venom (Sheesh)
Slime Thugger wit' it (Wit'), Slime DK wit it (Slatt)
Slime Wicced with it (Slatt), Slime Mondo wit it (Slime)
Slime Slugger with it (Slime), Slime Bubba wit it
Slime Check with it (Yeah)
Count hundreds and fifties off everyone city
[Chorus]
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (Stoner)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (What?)
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner (Ye)
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner
[Post-Chorus]
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss
(I feel like Fabo)
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss (I feel like Fabo)
I just drank with YSL just like a f— boss
(I feel like Fabo)
Just like a f— boss, just like a, ch-ch! Boss, boss!
[Verse 2]
Run that money up, like you're 'bout to start trial
When you beat the case, turn into a stoner child
We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet
Everybody stoned, weed, lean, molly, E (Woo)
Every time I walk inside the club, I see everybody looking
You know I'm a stoner, I love drugs and I can't never be tooken
And you can suck my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a lil' closer, my bitch won't know you
Andalé andalé andalé, andalé andalé andalé
How the fuck a nigga think he gon' survive on a YSL runway
(How, fool?)
My glasses are metro no blood off your chest
I control your ho like Net-and-flix
Your bitch is my dinner, she wet like a fish
I took off her three legs: T-Rex
[Chorus]
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner
[Post-Chorus]
I just put a forty on my wrist just like a boss
I just put ten thousand on my bitch just like a boss
I just drank with YSL just like a f— boss
Just like a f— boss, just like a, boss, boss
[Outro]
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel like Fabo, I feel like Fabo
I feel just like
