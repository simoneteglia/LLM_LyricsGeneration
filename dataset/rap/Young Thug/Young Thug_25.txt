[Intro: Young Thug]
Thugger
Slime, snake life
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Eighty-hundred capsules of Molly
Just be very still, I ain't gonna hurt anybody
Hell nah, I ain't 12, but if I like it, I cop it
I met Papi and he say he good at uploadin' wallets
Catch me ridin' with them slimes 'cause them my youngins
Catch me boolin' with them slimes 'cause them my youngins
I be slimin' with them slimes 'cause them my youngins
Catch me slidin' with the slimes 'cause them my youngins (Hey)

Chrissy Carter bezel inside my baby pampers, ew (Ew)
I get all the work and let the J's snort the scale (Sheesh)
My bitch ride slow with the yay' like she get L's (Sheesh)
I wear that white, I cook that white, but I am not no chef (Woo)
Add a little soda to put the tan on it (Tan on it)

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle
I was fly like a bird, I had on Stüssy Bape camo
With a cutie español, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had Jacobsen sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando 'cause her mama got cancer
She can't work in the States because her green papers ain't legal (Yeah)
Fuck a "dame un beso", she be like, "Run de un peso" (Alright)
Push the molly to Pedro so she can feed her
abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that dance pole (Alright)
She can't lose, she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Napo
-Leon, I could be ruler and ride the streets on my Benzo
So, then she get money vicarious off her friends though
'Cause a kid named Birdy look nerdy but he be after the bando (Alright)
She robbed Birdy for birdies, now Birdy after her head though
Hold on I think I see Birdy and Birdy killed my Cuban ho (Ferg)
