[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Own a label, I gotta get smarter (Spider)
I don't trust women, so I thank God that I had some daughters (Woo)
I'm the youngest, but yet I'm richer than every one of my brothers (Let's go)
I took flawless baguettes and put it on my mama and father
L.A., I get my pills from a doctor
Pimpin' a couple of bitches at Copper
I didn't like that pic, now crop it
You talkin' 'bout a check, now stop it
Water slip off my wrist, it's droppin'
Now I got a couple baguettes in my pocket
Big B, I been rockin' Chanel, then throwin' up Cs and that's for
Charlie
, ha
Point it out, you know I'ma buy it
Yeah, I was livin' my life on a yacht (Uh)
I ain't takin' my chain off, thot (Nah)
Like the way that you suckin' my cock (Woo-woo)
Got some Act',
then let's go get a pop
(Let's go)
Took the latch off and went to the top
(Let's go)
Niggas tried to say that I wasn't hot
Now they say I don't belong in this spot, ha, uh
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Metro, Metro, Metro bought me a painting from Basel
(Woo)
I went two-tone on my bezel, Baccarat the candles
Maybach, gettin' me some top, meanwhile I flip the channel
Bigger than the president, now my whole life a scandal
, yeah
Spider, spider, spider, please dismiss these writers, yeah
Caught up with your wifey and one night her, ayy
I put that shit on, I'm a fuckin' striker
Yeah, leather on, leather on leather like a fuckin' biker
[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Yeah, droppin' the top on the Lambo', know it's a 'mando, yeah
Yeah, whole life still a gamble, mob life just like
Sopranos
Yeah, Gallery Department, no sandals, and it's camo
My wrist is a chandelier, no beer over here, rock crocodile sandals all year
Better have manners right here, my family right here, nigga, both of my parents right here
Droppin' my album this year
, nobody gettin' spared, nigga, both of my banners right there
Know you see the fish-bowl tint and the motor geeked up, that's a motherfuckin' cam right there
Know you see the blam right there, they ain't playin' right there, they'll pull up in a Sedan right there
Hundred bands sittin' right there, you ain't gettin' no smoke, you a run for a band right there
All yo' opps in your face and you runnin' 'round this place, we ain't gettin' yo' man right there
I put the rose, rose, diamonds to poke in my motherfuckin' nose
She my sex slave, and she still don't let me pay though
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Metro, Metro, Metro bought me a painting from Basel
(Metro)
I went two-tone on my bezel, Baccarat the candles
Maybach, gettin' me some top, meanwhile I flip the channel
Bigger than the president, now my whole life a scandal
, yeah
Spider, spider, spider, please dismiss these writers, yeah
Caught up with your wifey, and one night her, ayy
I put that shit on, I'm a fuckin' striker, yeah
Leather on, leather on leather like a fuckin' biker
[Outro: Young Thug]
I been fresh as hell every time you see me on sight
Anything happen, my kids got Ms so everything alright
I done got used to takin' pills and bein' up all night
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
