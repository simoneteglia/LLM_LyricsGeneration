[Chorus: Young Thug]
All these diamonds in my chains got me dancing 'round this bitch
I'm Martin Luther King, black diamonds on my wrist
(
Run that back, Turbo
)
Put Giuseppes on my kids, put Chanel Coco on my bitch
Put that four-four on the switch, then you cock, pop, pop, then dip
I've been in the trenches, the trap, to be specific
I fell in love with my bitches, then sold 'em for some riches
This money be my missus, drive me crazy, I need Ritalin
I told 'em, "I'm so slimy, I'm so shady, I admit it, yeah"
[Verse 1: Young Thug &
Travis Scott
]
Slatt like to shoot, slatt like to murk
Twenty-one gun salute (Baow), drilling, putting in work (Yeah)
Cut his tonsils out (Woo), I said it'd hurt (Ayy)
Keep a new four-four, yeah, let it burst
Pockets Honey Kettlе, keep on pedal
Get my own cheddar, all my dogs bеtter
Honeycomb bezel, we make opps jitter
Maison Margielas, cases get settled
Here, clean the cookie off, family, Travis, the Scotts (
Yeah
)
Servin' the bags, I'm cookin' the stove
Came in the spot and we servin' with soap
I was just spazzing, finding the flow
I'm with some Crips, down with some Locs
Hand in the pot, I'm with some Bloods
How many slatts? Leave it to us (Yeah)
Yeah, countin' racks, smokin' on pot
Yeah, I upgraded my thot
Yeah, I upgraded my spots
Yeah, thots chickened out
Woo, yeah, the spots upgraded, now them bitches chickened out
Hey, thirty-five burnt hundreds on my pocket watch
[Chorus: Young Thug,
Young Thug & Gunna

All these diamonds in my chains got me dancing 'round this bitch
I'm Martin Luther King, black diamonds on my wrist
Put Giuseppes on my kids, put Chanel Coco on my bitch
Put that four-four on the switch, then you cock, pop, pop, then dip
I've been in the trenches, the trap, to be specific
I fell in love with my bitches, then sold 'em for some riches
This money be my missus, drive me crazy, I need Ritalin
I told 'em, "I'm so slimy, I'm so shady,
I admit it, yeah"
