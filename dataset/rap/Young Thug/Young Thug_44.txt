[Verse 1: Young Thug]
The price I want for a show, you 'gon need three promoters (Woo)
I got the body from Jim Ellis, but I had switched the motor (Skrrt)
I got these bad ass bitches riding 'round this bitch and they all the coldest (Yeah)
I just told her make a store run (Yeah)
I just bought all the Trojans (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
I told her stay out my mentions (Yeah)
I told her stop telling everything she seen and told hеr, "Meet me at the Ritz" (Let's go)
I got baguеttes in the back of my ring and I wasn't even tryna hit
(Tryna hit, yeah, yeah)
I told her she gotta run through the team before she can talk to the lick ('Fore she can talk to the, yeah)
Lamb chop, I just pulled up in some food
(Skrrt, skrrt)
I told lil' mama, "Tie all my shoes" (My shoes)
Showed her two million cash, now she woozy (Woah)
Twenty watches and I'm still snoozin' (Twenty)
I had came up out the trenches, then I had beat a few bodies like Boosie (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woah, woah)
She said, "You murk 'em, I show you my coochie"
I had to sing to this bitch like lil' Toosii (Woo)

Yeah, yeah (Woo)
Yeah, yeah (Ski)
Yeah, yeah (Ski)
Yeah, yeah (Let's go)
[Post-Chorus: Young Thug]
Bitch got a Backwood on her nightstand, she must be fuckin' with Gunna (Yeah, yeah)
I fuck with slatts and we come to eat rats and I came with some fuckin' piranhas (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Gunna &
Young Thug
]
All this Biscotti I got in my 'Wood, need somebody grow me a tree (Tree)
Came out the hood, now my trunk got a hood, now I crank up the car with no keys
Beat it, she for the street-neet-neets
Only once, she got hit at the 'spinini
I feel a lil' rich this week, to influence my family to not be cheap (Be cheap)
I tote an FN on me, call Neechie-Neech, it’s a Glock he keep
Duke Rollin' 60's, he locked in C's
We roll in that coupe with the bucket seats (Bucket seats)
Got out that mud like a football cleat
I used to trap out of that four-door Jeep (Four-door)
Call up the plug and he know what I need (Know what I need)
Stay on her knees so we hardly speak (Hardly speak,
yeah
)
I'm in New York counting shmoney (
Yeah
)
Ain't the stuntman, but I'm stuntin' (
Yeah
)
Wunna, these vibes wanna love me (
Yeah
)
Not wifey, and no lovey-dovey
[Chorus: Young Thug]
Yeah, yeah (Woo)
Yeah, yeah (Ski)
Yeah, yeah (Ski)
Yeah, yeah (Let's go)
[Post-Chorus: Gunna &
