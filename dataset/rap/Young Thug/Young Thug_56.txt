[Intro: Travis Scott]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Did you forget? Do it for life
Chicago that time, all bullshit aside
Wonderful vibe, wonderful night (Yeah)
Did it with tribe
All I can hear is you and I
Up in this club, bumpin' and grind
Who made it flood? You see the signs (Sign)
Signs, signs, signs (Yeah)
[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We pulled out the feathers for this type of weather
She pulled to the club to bust up a dub
She came with her man, I called in a sub
She givin' out hugs, we know 'bout them hugs
She put in my hand, don't know what it was
She know some the fam, but don't know enough (Enough)
My trust is in "In God We Trust"
(Caught in a trance, yeah)
Sippin' on Wock, don't do 'Tuss
She got her own fans, she need her a bus
Might give her a chance, it's givin' her— (Uh)
Out in a trance, it's givin' her— (Uh)
Not on no Xans, it's givin' her— (Uh)
Nigga with bands, it's givin' her— (Trance)
A nigga with plans, it's givin' her— (Uh)
Still in the gym, ain't did the implants
I like that for real, ain't givin' up
Like they know that you real, they give it up (Real)
Like if you got the steel, they give it up (Steel)
Takin' these Ms they givin' us
And run in the field like it's ten of us (Ten, ten, ten)
I'm cleanin' shit out like a enema
I make this shit look like a cinema (Ten, ten, ten)
(Caught in a trance, yeah)

Arm out the window, just throw it when we ride
I bent the corner, scraped the wheel and the tires (Woo)
Put twenty hoes on a boat 'til they tired
Everybody on (On)
You know you need me, my nigga
Just keep this shit real, don't you cry, what you saw? (Need)
Who else fuck up the city like us? When it rain, it's a thunderstorm (Thunderstorm)
I party at Shabba in New York and L.A. where they keep on goin' to the dawn (Shabba)
Two hundred K what I'm on (Two hundred)
She lickin' all down my chest (Down my, lick down my chest, yeah, yeah)
