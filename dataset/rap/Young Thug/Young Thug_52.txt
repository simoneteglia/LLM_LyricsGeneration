I got latitude, I was reaching out the avenue
Capture you, beat you bad, nigga, battle you
Snake shit, shoot your chest and shoot your bladder, too
Ape shit, we go monkey, go banana, too
Difference between me and him is he gon' run from you
And I'm nev' gonna run, I'ma gun at you
Hunnid K for the teeth got some gum on you
Cause my wife is too bad, she the bomb on you
Baby, suck that dick until it cum on you
I'ma suck that pussy, put some nut on you
She gon' drawdown with me, got you runnin', too
And just for that, I might put a son in you
Put that thirty piece right in my bomber, too
Quarter milli' Chanel, and she stuntin', too
