[Intro: Big Sean]
Metro, we done came up, dawg, and never look down
I might, gotta throw my Jesus chain on for this
[Chorus: Big Sean]
When you put the work in, man, it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit an all-time low
Been at a stand still and had to go, go, go
Man, they out here on a scheme like la, la, la
Breakin' promises you need like na, na, na
No hearts, no love, no "Kumbaya", ya
No hearts, no love, no "Kumbaya", ya
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Everythin' automatic, so I can't waste time
And if we break up, I only make up time
My team do this shit easier than lay-up lines
Never scared to cross that line or pay up fines
Look, Don, Don, Don, that's my top three in the order
Never took a shortcut, need a crib off the lake
Backyard look like a short club
Shoutout to my loyal ones, I wish that it was more of us
Went from thirty thousand a year to thirty thousand feet as my floor plan
I got El Chapo with a choppa as my doorman
I'm on the other side takin' care of what's important
If business not boomin', then it's time to change the format
Time to change the recipe, I'm special especially
Goin' for the record, no felony, and I'm dodgin' jail and jealousy
Daydreamin' 'bout a cruise with Penelope
Lookin' like success fell on me (Damn)
And get rid of all that jealousy, all that hate in your heart
I ain't got no enemies, I'm focused on what's meant for me
Puttin' my energy back into me, real shit
[Chorus: Big Sean]
When you put the work in, man, it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit an all-time low
Been at a stand still and had to go, go, go
Man, they out here on a scheme like la, la, la
Breakin' promises you need like na, na, na
No hearts, no love, no "Kumbaya", ya
No hearts, no love, no "Kumbaya", ya
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy, this shit intricate
Workin' like a machine, they keep tryna throw a wrench in it
But I'm too intuitive and into it
No ghostwritin', no sixth sensin' it
That's why all this shit sound so intimate
That's why I feel like you know me before we face-to-face
As for the latest, I'm the greatest Ali Bomaye
I put that work in overnight like that shit due today
I paint the pictures they can't trace, try and you get erased
I'm less focused on props and more on property
Done put so much back in my hood that I changed the economy
I'm 'bout to build a movie theater downtown properly
And help revive the heart of the city, just keep on watchin' me
And if these bitch-ass niggas got they wish and stoppin' me
Just know I done, done so much good business in my life
That there's gon' always be a job for me, an opp for me
I never burned bridges so there's a hundred ways to get where I gotta be, Don
[Bridge: Big Sean]
Same people, you see on the way up
Same ones you gonna see on the way down
You feel me? You love me, I love you
You hate me, I love you (Straight up)
[Chorus: Big Sean]
When you put the work in, man, it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit an all-time low
Been at a stand still and had to go, go, go
Man, they out here on a scheme like la, la, la
Breakin' promises you need like na, na, na
No hearts, no love, no "Kumbaya", ya
No hearts, no love, no "Kumbaya", ya
[Outro: Future]
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
