[Intro: Lori Perry]
Day after day seems like I push against the clouds
They just keep blocking out the sun
It seems since I was born
I've wakened every blessed morning
Down on my luck and up against the wind
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah (No, no)
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused (Don't)
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain
'Cause I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch, I ain't goin' to your event
You do too much goin' out and not enough goin' in
I got too much goin' on, so I'm gone with the wind (Gone)
And if I ain't gonna work, then I'm goin' to the gym (To the gym)
Yeah, bitch, I'm that focused, don't get it confused
I'm too spiritual to lose, it's worth every single bruise
Long as the dogs proud of me, then I got nothin' else to prove
Long as Milly proud of me, then I got nothin' else to prove
I'm a G, I'm a Don, I'm a soldier (I'm a soldier)
I'm charged up, man I'm beamin', I'm solar (Pew)
I'm from the streets, full of heat, don't get boiled
They chew you up and spit you out, like it's spoiled
And my mind is an open mind
I believe in the Bible and Quran
And I follow the signs, yeah not street signs
I mean universal signs, I'm outside
And I realize my life got more meanin' than a triple-entendre
And I realize any time the perfect time
[Chorus: Big Sean]
So don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain
'Cause I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, look
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Don't nobody know me like I know me (Like I know me)
So I follow instincts only (Only)
Man, I done been double-crossed by the homies
I learned the hard way that they was authentic phonies (Fake bitch)
Boy, shit so real in the field that I hardly stand still, but take care of my body still
I been drinkin' more water and poppin' less pills, man
Unless they vitamins, 'cause nigga I'm tryna live
And God blessed me like I got bad allergies
So I'm workin' like I run off an eternal battery
And if I dress casual, no I'm not a casualty (No, no)
And if I put my mind to it then that's what it has to be
Yeah you're fuckin' right damn, sure bitch that's for certain (Fuckin' right)
Never cut the family ties, I only cut the burdens (Woah)
Got so many cuts and scars, it look like I left the surgeon
Done been through so much shit, dawg, I'm a whole 'nother person (Thank God)
[Chorus: Big Sean]
So don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah (No, no)
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain
'Cause I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah
[Outro: Big Sean &
Future
]
I'm in space, I'm in mind, I'm in tune
On a mission 'til I get inside my tomb and cocoon
Every success is just a checkpoint, pass and move
When I leave this body, I'ma prolly set up on the moon
Hold it down, I'm the glue
We be here, that I knew, since Timbaland and Magoo
And I proved and I bloom, I'm gon' win more than my room
Hand straight up like it's noon
If I can't live a hundred years, I'm gone way too soon
I'm in tune
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
