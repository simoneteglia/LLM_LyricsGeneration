[Verse 1: gnash & Rosabeales]
Walk with me in the dark
Hold my hand through the park
Don't be scared it'll be alright
Come to bed, turn out the light
[Pre-Chorus: gnash & Rosabeales]
Something about you
Makes me wanna try again
[Chorus: gnash & Rosabeales]
I tried to fill the space
Forgive for my mistakes
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
I can't forget your face
Come home, don't fade away
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
[Verse 2: gnash]
I tried some other things I know you did too
I've seen all the crazy things you've been through
You know for me it's always only been you
You'll always be all I ever need
[Verse 3: gnash]
It's simple
See, me and you were made to grow together not just go together
Share a soul together, build a home together
Touch our toes together, steal the show together
They're all so whatever, this is so forever, I'll hold you better
See, you and me is enough cause you plus me it was love
And you plus me equals us
[Pre-Chorus: gnash & Rosabeales]
Something about you
Makes me wanna try again
[Chorus: gnash & Rosabeales]
I tried to fill the space
Forget for my mistakes
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
I can't forget your face
Come home, don't fade away
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
[Bridge: gnash & Rosabeales]
I know you know better than to go (So don't go)
I know you know better than to go (So don't go)
[Spoken: gnash & (Rosabeales)]
You know what my dad always says? (What does he always say?)
That love is when all your happiness and all your sadness
And all your feelings are dependent upon another person (Uh huh)
So I guess I love you (Haha)
[Chorus: gnash & Rosabeales]
I tried to fill the space
Forget for my mistakes
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
I can't forget your face
Come home, don't fade away
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
You just can't be replaced
