[Intro: Nessly]
Daytrip took it to 10 (Hey)
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold
[Post-Chorus: Lil Nas X]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold
[Post-Chorus: Lil Nas X &
Cardi B
]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought (

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, gunshot, gunshot
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow (Woo)
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is Snapped
Now you know how I get, every day, a foreign whip
Rather see you in a hearse
Than see you with some other bitch, huh (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold
[Post-Chorus: Lil Nas X]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
[Outro: Lil Nas X]
I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you
