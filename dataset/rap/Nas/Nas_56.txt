[Part 1]
[Verse 1]
It's getting to the point where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly, I must cry out loud
"I am lonely"
[Chorus]
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
[Verse 2]
Remember what we've said and done and felt about each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming
[Chorus]
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
Tearing yourself away from me now--you are free
And I am crying
This does not mean I don't love you--I do, that's forever
Yes and for always
[Chorus]
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
[Verse 4]
Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock and laughter the key to your heart
And I love you
[Chorus]
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
And you make it hard
[Part 2]
[Verse 5]
Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you
What have you got to lose?
[Bridge]
Can I tell it like it is? (help me, I'm suffering)
Listen to me, baby
It's my heart that's suffering, it's a-dying (help me, I'm suffering)
And that's what I have to lose
[Verse 6]
I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?
[Instrumental Break]
[Part 3]
[Verse 7]
Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing the song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow
[Verse 8]
Voices of the angels
Ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she so free
"How can you catch the sparrow?"
[Verse 9]
Lacy, lilting, leery
Losing love, lamenting
Change my life, make it right
Be my lady
[Part 4]
