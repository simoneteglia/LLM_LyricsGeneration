[Pre-Chrous: Nasty C]
Up with the weights, I work (work, work)
Down with the pack, I roll (I roll, roll)
Now up with the sack and you know that I deserve it
Half and half when we split the purse, yeah
The preacher man said:
"Please remember that your savior's on the way"
I still remember when the teacher man said:
"I wouldn't make it", but I made it anyway
[Chorus: Runtown]
I remember sey it wasn't easy
Right now everyting is amazing
Steady driving dem loco
Them are taking my photo
I remember that they telling me no, no
Right now everyting is global
Steady driving dem loco
Them are taking my photo
[Verse 1: Nasty C]
Now I put the labour in full effect
I keep the prayers in motion, ain't no pulling back
I was boxed in, all the boxes that I couldn't check
And God came through for me would you look at that
Now I'm building a legacy outta hobby
I never chased the dream, I designed it
Big crib, you hear the echo in the lobby
Boy I was broke as hell when they found me
Hell is where they found me
I'm past it, I made it, facts
My haters all plastic, fake in fact
My family is all happy, I'm grateful, thanks
And all the things I say are all naked, facts
I hope I get to meet up with my mother when I'm gone
Just to talk about my life and all the hurdles that I've won
I ain't saying it was flawless
'Cause at times I got it wrong
I had nobody to talk to so I said it in the song
All I do is go
[Pre-Chrous: Nasty C]
Up with the weights, I work (work, work)
Down with the pack, I roll (I roll, roll)
Now up with the sack and you know that I deserve it
Half and half when we split the purse, yeah
The preacher man said:
"Please remember that your savior's on the way"
I still remember when the teacher man said:
"I wouldn't make it", but I made it anyway
[Chorus: Runtown]
I remember sey it wasn't easy
Right now everyting is amazing
Steady driving dem loco
Them are taking my photo
I remember that they telling me no, no
Right now everyting is global
Steady driving dem loco
Them are taking my photo
[Verse 2: Runtown]
