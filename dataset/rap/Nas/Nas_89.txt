[Verse 1]
I wanna hear your voice but I don't wanna respond
Don't really have a choice
Just kind of hit me that you're gone
Haven't spoke for a minute
I have been barely living
I have been... It only feels so fitting
The only care that you were given
Is the loving that I'm currently missing
We made your WiFi-code and it's saved to my phone
Sometimes I type it in the dots[?] just to check if I'm home
Just like E.T. and the stars on your ceiling
Reflect my glow in the dark heart while it's beating and I'm bleeding out
We were about that scream and shout but what was it that we screamed about
With or without couldn't figure what would sting worse
Always wondered who would leave first
[Chorus]
Leave a message
When no one else is near you
So no one else can hear you
Tell me everything
Leave a message
When there's no one else around
I don't wanna hear it now but can't seem to turn you down
Leave a ...
[Verse 2]
Sorry I lost you ... But I got something to say before I leave
I'm sorry that I miss you but it's cool, get to see you in my dreams
Thanks for showing me how love feels
Thanks for showing me how loss feels too
Thanks for making me strong when things fall apart
Thanks for the try, at least we had a good start
Just wanted to hold you down but you put me on hold
And I gave you all my heart
And I gave you my soul
Baby, every little thing is gonna be alright
You'll always be on my mind, can't always be in my life
I know one day you'll smile with all the happy you need
I hope one day you'll smile with all the happy at me
I know one day you'll see everything in view that I see[?]
And I hope one day you'll be as happy as you pretend to be
[Chorus]
Leave a message
When no one else is near you
So no one else can hear you
Tell me everything
Leave a message
When there's no one else around
I don't wanna hear it now but can't seem to turn you down
Leave a message
[Outro]
There's ideas we had, that we no longer know
There's places we've been, that we no longer go
There's things we learn, that we don't wanna know
And there's people we love, that we have to let go
[Chorus]
Leave a message
When no one else is near you
So no one else can hear you
Tell me everything
Leave a message
When there's no one else around
I don't wanna hear it now but can't seem to turn you down
Leave a message
