[Verse 1: Naseebo Lal]
Peeraan nu main seene laavaan
Te main hasdi jaavaan
O, Peeraan nu main seene laavaan
Te main hasdi jaavaan
Doophan de naal lad-lad ke mein
Labyaan apniyan chaavaan
Dukh vi apne, sukh vi apne
Main te bas eh jaana
Sab noon samajh ke ki karna ae
Dil noon ae samjhaavaan
[Chorus: Naseebo Lal]
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
[Verse 2: Abida Parveen]
Mai deewani, kuch na jaana, mast ho ke gaawaan
Duniya raazi karke kamle, phir vi chain nai aauna
Saari khushiyan mil jaavan te picche ki reh jaana
Saari khushiyan mil jaavan te picche ki reh jaana
Tere bas me kuch vi nahi eh, dil nu eh samjhavan
[Chorus: Abida Parveen &
Choir
]
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
O, tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
O, tu jhoom
[Instrumental-Break]
[Verse 3: Naseebo Lal &
Abida Parveen
]
Main raazi apni zaat toon
Main uttay apni aukaat toon
Ae duniya meri fikar naheen
Main samajh gayi har baat nu
Ki karna eh oonchyaan shaanaan nu
Ki hath laana aasmaanaan nu
Main hasde-hasde hai jeena
Main nikal gaye gumaanaan toon
[Bridge: Naseebo Lal &
Abida Parveen
]
Main te mere wargiaan ki khud kolon sharmana
Duniya raazi kar vi layi eh, phir vi chain nahi aauna
Jo hai tera lab jayega, karke koi bahana
Tere bas me kuch vi nahi hai, dil nu eh samjhawaan
[Chorus: Abida Parveen,
Naseebo Lal
&
Choir
]
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
O, tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
[Outro: Abida Parveen &
Naseebo Lal
]
Main deewani kuch na jaana
Main deewani, mai deewani
Main deewaani
O, main deewani kuch na jaana
Main mastani kuch na jaana
Main mastani kuch na jaana, kuch na jaana
Tu jhoom, tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Main raazi apni zaat toon
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Ahha, nighaye.., nighaye..
Ooohooo..
Nigah-e-yaar jisse ashna-e-raaz kare
Wo apni khoobi, wo apni khoobi-e-qismat pe kyun na naaz kare
Wo apni khoobi-e-qismat pe kyun na naaz kare, naaz kare
O, tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, tu jhoom, tu jhoom tu
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom
Tu jhoom, jhoom, jhoom, jhoom...
