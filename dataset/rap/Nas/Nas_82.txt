[Verse 2: Lil Darkie]
I know lots of niggas that got guns for fun
And when they handlin' the drum it go dun-dun-dun
Because they comin' and it's rainin', cover up the sun
"I don't self-snitch," tell him if you up to some
But I cap in my raps, so the rats cannot tell the difference
I like snorting smack off her back while I'm acid trippin'
I might put the 'Gnac in my crack, now my butthole sippin'
Bitch, I like to cap, like a hat, anarchy the mission
[Chorus: Lil Darkie]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
(I sell crack, nigga)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
(Cr-ah)
