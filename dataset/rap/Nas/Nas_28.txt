(Rule #1)
[Verse 1]
Don't worry 'bout a bitch who never been in your place (Huh?)
Always move in silence, never question your fate (Rule #2)
Always check in on ya niggas, gotta make sure they
straight
If I'm gettin' money, then you know we all got a plate
Since a baby in her tummy mama knew I was great
They can't play me like a dummy, they know what not to take
Fuck these niggas 'cause the money only thing I'ma chase
Time is precious, that's the only thing I try not to waste
She hatin' 'cause I'm up, you can tell on her face
I been eatin' so much, I been sayin' my grace
When the times was rough, I would look up and pray
Thank God I ain't have to smack a bitch today
[Chorus]
Oh my fucking God, smack a bitch today
Thank God I ain't have to smack a bitch today
Yeah! Smack a bitch today
Thank God I ain't have to smack a bitch today (Huh?)
Yeah, woah, smack a bitch today
Thank God I ain't have to smack a bitch today
Huh? Smack a bitch today
Thank God I ain't have to smack a bitch today

Blast off, fast car, cool breeze in ya face (Whoa!)

Because my Audi paid off, bitch, hush! (Shut the fuck up!)
"Why she be yellin' so much?"
If I see you in the streets, bitch, ya ass is done (Lalalalala, hahaha)
I don't need your opinion (I don't need it, bitch)
