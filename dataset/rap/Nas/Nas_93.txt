[Verse 1: DaBaby]
She know I'm nasty (Yeah)
She like when I pull it out and I put it all over her ass cheeks (Like, uh, ooh)
And she don't gotta ask me (C'mon)
Yeah, I want head before we fuck and I want it nasty
She like when I tell her to spit on it (Like, psh)
I get that mouth and I sit on the couch and I make her sit on it (Let's go)
Yeah, I was that lil' nigga that could take a bitch from his big homie
Especially if she flexible, I flex her
I take both her legs and I put 'em behind her head like she a pretzel
Then I pick her up and I slam her down on her head like I'm a wrestler
Like mm, tryna kill the pussy, call the ambulance, get a stretcher
I be fucking his bitch while he ain't at home
And she got them pics of me in her phone
Know that man a fool if he don't leave
'Cause bitch can't leave a nigga alone, she call me
[Chorus: Ashanti &
Megan Thee Stallion
]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
We got London On Da Track
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
She ain't fuckin' you better than I am
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh, oh-woah
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (
Real hot girl shit
)
Ooh, the shit will never feel the same, yeah (
Ahh
)
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Quit talking that shit, when I drop that pin, come drop that dick (Come drop that dick)
He deep in them covers, this pussy like butter, he put it in, damn near nutted (Yeah)
He know he made it, he fuckin' on Megan, it's driving his last ho crazy
I like to talk shit when I fuck, I need a rough nigga like DaBaby (Haa, haa, haa, haa)
When he hit the city, he gon' tap in, he gon' fly me out to put it back in
And I ain't trippin' when a nigga pull my hair, 'cause he gon' pay for it to put it back in
I put one leg on the headboard and leave the other leg on the mattress
Look down at him while he smackin', get them headshots like an actress (Haa)
[Verse 3: DaBaby]
Yeah, my baby like to act up when we fuckin' (Uh-huh)
Aggressive freak, she tell me to smack her when we fuckin'
I started to laugh, she said "What's funny?"
She throwing that ass, she said "Quit running"
I'm holding it back, 'cause I don't wanna nut quick, but fuck it
Really got nothing to hide, she know what I'm what's up with
Me, we started at 12:30 and fucking 'til three
It's hot, I'm sweating out bullets on her, I need something to drink
Feel like a workout, don't it? (Uh-huh)
I'm doing my push-ups in that pussy
We getting our work out on it (Mm-mm)
I put a bath towel on the bed, just so she can squirt all on it
Like fwoosh, told you to stretch, now it hurt, now don't it? (Uh-huh)
She said, "Fuck if it hurts, I want it", I'm on it
She like when I take a pill and take her under (Let's go)
I fucked that bitch so good, she prolly ain't even save ya number (Yeah)
Like "Boom, boom, boom", lay the thunder
Mm, mm, say she wanna be my baby mama
Girl, you on the right track, yeah
I put it in her face, she say she like that, yeah (Brr), she call me
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I make him spend it all, this boy done fell in love
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, he fiendin', he can't get enough, no, no
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, he comin' when I say his name, yeah
[Bridge: Ashanti]
Sometimes I just want you to slide right in (Slide right in)
Pick me up and put these thighs around your neck (Thighs around your neck)
He mesmerized, tattoed his mind, he won't forget
DaBaby tryna have a threesome with 'Shanti and Megan, ayy
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, oh
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
