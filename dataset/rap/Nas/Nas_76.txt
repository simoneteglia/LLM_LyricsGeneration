[Chorus]
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin' (
I'm star walkin'
)
[Verse 1]
On a mission to get high up, I know that I'ma die
Reachin' for a life that I don't really need at all
Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise
You should never take advice from a nigga that ain't try
[Pre-Chorus]
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed, too
[Chorus]
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin' (
I'm star walkin'
)
[Verse 2]
Been that nigga since I came out my mama (Woo)
Thankin' God Daddy never wore a condom (Woo)
Prove 'em wrong every time 'til it's normal
Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em?
Th-These niggas don't like me, they don't like me
Likely, they wanna fight me
Come on, try it out, try me
They put me down, but I never cried out, "Why me?"
Word from the wise, don't put worth inside a nigga
that ain't try
[Pre-Chorus]
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed, too
[Chorus]
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin' (
I'm star walkin'
)
[Post-Chorus]
(
I'm star walkin'
)
[Outro]
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
