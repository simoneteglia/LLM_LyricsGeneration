[Intro]
Wait

Woo, uh
[Chorus]
Doing eighty in a sixty, fuck a ticket (Fuck it)
'Cause I ain't had that pussy in a minute, in a minute (Woo)
I told her when I get it, I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it
She told me that she want it, I'll be there when I'm finished
Ooh, girl, I'm on the way, ayy

[Verse 1]
You know you on my mind
I see you getting thick from behind, and them thighs
She looked at me like Nala
Said, "Nigga, why you lying?"
Girl, with all that shake, it might as well come with fries
Love it when she cook steak and taters on the side
That grown women shit, might as well add some wine
She like, "Baby, hurry up, so we can take our time"
Fine, I'ma call you when a nigga outside, ayy
[Interlude]
Hello?

I'ma be honest, I ain't even left the house yet
[Chorus]
Doing eighty in a sixty, fuck a ticket (Fuck it)
'Cause I ain't had that pussy in a minute, in a minute (Woo)
I told her when I get it, I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it
She told me that she want it, I'll be there when I'm finished
Ooh, girl, I'm on the way, ayy
I just left the club and I'm 'bout to make a play, I'm on the way, way
She told me that she cooking, I said, gon' and make a plate
I'm on the way (Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Look, in '09, we used to get high, baby
Lowkey, we was like Bonnie and Clyde, baby
It was plain as day, we still tried to hide them
Feelings inside, do you remember the time, baby?
Remember we used to vibe, baby?
You roll it up and I used to drive, baby
You light it up and I gripped your thigh, baby
Ayy, just tell me it's mine, baby
Yeah, she like nigga where you at

Park in the visitor so you won't get towed
It's been a minute, baby, I've been on the road

Yeah, go tell her that I'm home
And tell her I can't talk on the phone
'Cause you know I'm doing
[Chorus]
Doing eighty in a sixty, fuck a ticket (Fuck it)
'Cause I ain't had that pussy in a minute, in a minute (Woo)
I told her when I get it, I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it
She told me that she want it, I'll be there when I'm finished
Ooh, girl, I'm on the way, ayy
I just left the club and I'm 'bout to make a play, I'm on the way, way
She told me that she cooking, I said, gon' and make a plate
