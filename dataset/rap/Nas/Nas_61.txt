[Hook]
Feelings fade when people change
I stayed the same
You played your games
And now we're left with nothing
I'm not okay, but it's okay
Don't walk away
I'll take the blame
Before we're left with nothing
Don't know if I'll be fine without you
I hope I'll be alright without you
[Verse 1]
I'm tired of:
Fake people, fake smiles, fake hugs
Fake hope, fake friends, fake love
Cuz fake friends are a real waste of time
And fake love is real waste of life
So don’t you go texting me
Telling me
Wish you were next to me
Rest in peace
Everything’s ending eventually
Best friends can become your enemies
[Pre-Hook]
Do we have to talk about it?
You know how I make you feel, right?
You know I’d be lost without you
You never felt something so real, right?
Remember when we ran through all the fountains
In downtown that one night?
Now I’m running away
From the one that I thought was the one, right, cuz
[Hook]
Feelings fade when people change

Before we're left with nothing
Don't know if I'll be fine without you
I hope I'll be alright without you
[Verse 2]
I’m tired of:
Secrets, lies, excuses
Holding back, the truth is -
I act like I don’t care, but I wish you did
You used to make me smile, now you make me sick
I wish I didn’t waste my time
I wish you didn’t change my mind

[Outro]
(Ahh man)
I hope our feelings don’t fade
I know we know we need space
I’m sorry, I know it’s late
But I’ve got something to say
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
It’s gonna be okay, okay
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
Cuz tomorrow’s just a dream away
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
It’s gonna be okay, okay
It’s gonna be okay, okay tonight
Cuz tomorrow’s just a dream away
