[Intro: Dirtbike LB]
Narsayee? (Skrr, skrr)
Ahh (Hee, yeah)
Skrr (Skrr, skrr, skrr)
[Chorus: Young Adz]
Yeah, I'm a nasty arse nigga, I kiss every single body part she got
I'm still a G
I take ten bands out and get them other shotters shot the fuck up in OT
When they ask you who you work for, you just point to number 29 and say you work for me
I know some niggas that wouldn't do what they doing in the kitchen if it weren't for me
[Verse 1: Dirtbike LB]
Henny in my cup, I got bored of sipping mud
Roley on her arm, she been feeling like the one
Smoke until I'm calm, gelato 41
Came up off of crumb, L.A for the month
She my fifi, she my Keke, you know I'm her E.T
Lay a finger on my darling, that's a
mazzaleenie
Five thousand on my nieces, Moncler when it's breezy
Send them shooters to your ma'
[Verse 2: Young Adz]
Yeah, thirty thousand feet in my Adidas
Straight promethazine, it got me lean up
Take her to Dior, 'cause she a freak, yo
This is New Jack City, bitch, I'm Nino (Yah, yah)
Forty thousand dollars when I reload
Gelato 41, no Sour D though
She want Fenty make-up when she fleek up
I hope they feel the same when we meet up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Young Adz]
I'm a nasty arse nigga, I kiss every single body part she got
I'm still a G
I take ten bands out and get them other shotters shot the fuck up in OT
When they ask you who you work for, you just point to number 29 and say you work for me
I know some niggas that wouldn't do what they doing in the kitchen if it weren't for me
[Verse 3: Lil Pino &
Young Adz
]
They must think I wanna die
LB out in L.A, he just went and crash the Porsche
I'ma dive head first in that pussy
Lil Pino, darling, I don't show remorse
I put the range away
Been looking so plain today
All of my VV's, Look at these TT's
I feel like Flavor Flav
Buj
on my Bathing Ape
Sell crack on my day to day
I call my shooter, he be a roofer
Pull up and save the day (Cha, cha, cha, cha)
[Chorus: Young Adz]
I'm a nasty arse nigga, I kiss every single body part she got
I'm still a G
I take ten bands out and get them other shotters shot the fuck up in OT
When they ask you who you work for, you just point to number 29 and say you work for me
I know some niggas that wouldn't do what they doing in the kitchen if it weren't for me
I'm a nasty arse nigga, I kiss every single body part she got
I'm still a G
I take ten bands out and get them other shotters shot the fuck up in OT
When they ask you who you work for, you just point to number 29 and say you work for me
I know some niggas that wouldn't do what they doing in the kitchen if it weren't for me
[Outro: Dirtbike LB]
22, ya narsayee? (Cha, cha)
Ya narsayee?
Ayy (Ayy, ayy)
