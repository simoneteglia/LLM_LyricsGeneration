[Intro: Lil Nas X]
(
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey
)
Baby back, ayy, couple racks, ayy
Couple Grammys on him, couple plaques, ayy
That's a fact, ayy, throw it back, ayy
Throw it back, ayy
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Nas X]
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
Uh, need to, uh
Need to get this album done
Need a couple number onеs
Need a plaque on every song
Need mе like one with Nicki now
Tell a rap nigga I don't see ya, hah
I'm a pop nigga like Bieber, hah
I don't fuck bitches, I'm queer, hah
But these niggas bitches like Madea, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy (Yeah)
Oh, let's do it
I ain't fall off, I just ain't release my new shit
I blew up, now everybody tryna sue me
You call me Nas, but the hood call me Doobie, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Nas X]
And this one is for the champions
I ain't lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they're waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway (Ooh, ooh)
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say (Ooh, ooh)
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (Woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers
[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over
[Outro: Lil Nas X]
Yeah
I'm the industry baby, mmm
I'm the industry baby
Yeah
