[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable
[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me
Feel like there's only now
[Post-Chorus]
I've been living in my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from fate
Can't go running back to home, I can't facе her face (Oh)
[Verse]
Oh, finally grown, ain't nothing like I hopеd it would be
Out on my own, I'm floating in an oceanless sea
Could I be wrong? Was everybody right about me?
Scary things in my head, I can't dream and I just
[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up on the floor
Oh, this plastic bed don't blow up no more (Ooh)
In this broken home
Everyone becomes predictable
[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes you're angry
Sometimes you're hurting
Sometimes you're all alone
Sometimes I'm anxious
Sometimes it makes me
Feel like there's only now
[Post-Chorus]
I've been living in my lowest, it's safe to say
Hope my little bit of hope don't fade away
I've been living on an island made from fate
Can't go running back to home, I can't face her face
[Outro]
Ooh
Ooh
