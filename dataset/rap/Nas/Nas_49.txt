[Hook: Nasty C & Rowlene]
How did I?
End up falling for you
I find myself calling for you
Into the dark I followed you but
I should’ve known this ain’t the type of shit I’d go through
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
[Bridge: Nasty C & Rowlene]
I feel you, I feel you
I feel you, I feel you ABC
You take me up and down and I follow you like ABC
You act like you in it but you were never here with me
I wish it could be
Wish it could be like ABC
[Verse 1: Nasty C]
She ask me
Junior do you like it when I cry? (Huh)
Do you consider my feelings when you lie (Huh)
You put me second to some bitch on the side (What)
You just gon’ let a ride or die die inside (Damn)
You forget I was with you before the racks came
Before these skanks came
Before the plaques came
Before you started getting money and your raps changed
I was with you when you was still thinking about changing your rap name, nigga!
Say something now
Are you choking?
Baby I’m sorry
Are you joking?
So much for convincing me to be open
I don’t know why I bother with you
When you’ve clearly chosen, this music over me
It owns all your emotions
And you really have to give it your undivided devotion
But somehow my heart feels safer when you hold it
Like you not the one that broke it
[Hook: Rowlene]
End up falling for you
I find myself calling for you
Into the dark I followed you but
I should’ve known this ain’t the type of shit I’d go through
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
[Verse 2: Nasty C]
Yeah
Look I’m in Joburg working
And you know I need money
Instead of telling me you hurting
Focus more on your studies
I’m not ignoring you trust me
I’m always busy with something
You call too late or too early
I couldn’t talk I was grumpy
You couldn’t talk you were grumpy?
We supposed to be-
Junior you told a hoe you don’t love me
She posted about it you dummy
All I ever did was love you
I don’t deserve to be punished
I cut off all my friends for you
What more do you want from me?
You cheated too
That was so long ago
One of my dudes
We dated long ago
That makes it cool?
I said I’m sorry though
What the fuck were y’all doing all along, huh?
'Guess I’ve always been a dummy
Bitch I dare you to lie to me and say you told him you love me
And you know what
I should’ve known you were hiding something
You laughed at everything he said
That nigga wasn’t even funny
You made me feel so insecure and weak as fuck
But I’m not sending you away
So you going to have to run from me
'Cause I still love you
[Hook: Rowlene]
End up falling for you
I find myself calling for you
Into the dark I followed you but
I should’ve known this ain’t the type of shit I’d go through
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
Send me away
[Bridge: Nasty C & Rowlene]
I feel you, I feel you
I feel you, I feel you ABC
You take me up and down and I follow you like ABC
You act like you in it but you were never here with me
I wish it could be
Wish it could be like ABC
