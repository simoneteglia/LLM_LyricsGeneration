[Verse 1/Intro]
I always see the light way before the dark
And you always see the end way before the start
I've been trying and finding that things going right
Aren’t as simple as everyone told me they would be
I know that you miss me
I’m sorry I’m busy
And don’t make the time
For the things you ask from me
[Pre-Chorus]
Out of breath
Out of time
Is it your turn?
Is it mine?
I can’t sleep tonight
I can’t sleep tonight, no
Is it fine, if we find
That in time this isn’t right
I can’t speak tonight
I can’t speak tonight, no
[Hook]
Just make me feel special
And make me feel loved
Make me feel something
Lately life’s made me numb
I just want to hold you
For just long enough
So you don’t get tired of me telling you
I love you so much
[Verse 2]
If I take care of you
Who’s gonna take care of me
I could just say take care and leave
But I love how you stare at me
I stay cause I’m scared to leave
I’m not prepared to be
Lonely without you see
That just won’t feel right
I need you in my life
[Pre-Chorus]
Out of breath
Out of time
Is it your turn?
Is it mine?
I can’t sleep tonight
I can’t sleep tonight, no
Is it fine, if we find
That in time this isn’t right
I can’t speak tonight
I can’t speak tonight, no
[Hook]
Just make me feel special
And make me feel loved
Make me feel something
Lately life’s made me numb
I just want to hold you
For just long enough
So you don’t get tired of me telling you
I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
[Bridge]
So don’t make me, no
Don’t make me go
Don’t make me
[Verse 3/Outro]
In a city I don’t know
Hit me three times ‘fore the show
I need sleep tonight
You'll be in my dreams tonight, tho'
