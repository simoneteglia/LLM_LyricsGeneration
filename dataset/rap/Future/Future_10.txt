[Intro: Future]
I'm able to, uh
The stage in my life where I'm
Where I feel like I can conquer anything and everything
(
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
)
[Pre-Chorus: Future &
Drake
]
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Poppin' tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin' in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinkin' that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me
[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
[Verse 1: Drake]
And you know what I need
From you when I get home (Yeah)
You better not be on the phone
Talkin' up a storm like you usually do
Talkin' to your friends like you usually do
Tellin' them I never spend time with you
It's hard to find a time, we been
[Pre-Chorus: Future &
Drake
]
Sippin' on Dom Pérignon for no reason
Poppin' tags, upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn, she was perfect
I'll let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Ballin' in the middle of the club, no jersey
I don't want no liquor 'cause I been drinkin' that dirty
Bring that Ace by the case, my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup, my drink with me
[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
[Verse 2: Future]
I'm familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin', you can vouch for me
I did it my way, you can vouch for me
I put the cocaine and the powder in the couch, homie
Whenever I step outside the house, I keep that glocky on me
Bad bitches wanna come by, the paparazzi on me
I got so many bad bitches that I barely want her
I'm barely paying attention, baby, I need substance
I know you spent some time puttin' on your makeup and your outfit, but
[Chorus: Drake & Future]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamonds on me dancing
[Outro: Drake]
You doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You doing me dirty
Doing me dirty
You doing me dirty
You know (Yeah, dirty, dirty)
How we let it get like this, I don't know (Yeah)
But that nigga can't save your soul (Nah)
Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty
Haven't even heard from you (Yeah)
How can you live with yourself?
I haven't even heard from you
How can you live with yourself? (Uh)
Ungrateful
Ungrateful (Hmm)
Your mom'd be ashamed of you
I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you
Ungrateful (Hah)
I'm too good for you, too good for you (Yeah)
You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable (Hah)
Doing me dirty (Dirty, dirty)
You're making me nervous
I haven't even heard from you
You look drained, you look exhausted
Girl, them late nights ain't good for you
Really starting to show on you
Don't hit me up when it's good for you
Ungrateful
