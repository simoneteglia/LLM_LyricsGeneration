[Intro: Future]
Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
If Young Metro don't trust you, I’m gon' shoot you
You heard, spit it, yo
[Chorus: Future]
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Percocets)
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Percocets)
Rep the set (Yee), gotta rep the set (Gang, gang)
Chase a check (Chase it), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches)
Mask on (Off), fuck it, mask off (Mask off)
Mask on (Off), fuck it, mask off (Mask off)
Percocets ('Cets), molly, Percocets (Percocets)
Chase a check (Chase it), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches)
[Verse 1: Future]
Two cups (Cups), toast up with the gang (Gang, gang)
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain, ya
Out the bottom (Ya), I'm the livin' proof (Super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on a coupe (Gang, gang)
Drug houses (Where?), lookin' like Peru (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Graduated, I was overdue (I'm on due)
Pink molly (Molly), I can barely move (Barely move)
Ask about me ('Bout me), I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James (James), thirty-three chains (Thirty-three)
Ocean air (Air), cruisin' Biscayne (Big foreigns)
Top off (Ya), that’s a liability (Big foreigns)
Hit the gas (Gas), boostin' my adrenaline (Big foreigns)
[Chorus: Future]
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Big foreigns)
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Big foreigns)
Rep the set (Yee), gotta rep the set (Gang, gang)
Chase a check (Chase it, ye), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches, big foreign)
Mask on (Off, ye), fuck it, mask off (Mask, big foreigns)
Mask on (Off, ye), fuck it, mask off (Mask, big foreigns)
Percocets ('Cets, ye), molly, Percocets (Big foreigns)
Chase a check (Chase it), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches)

Four-door Maybach (Four-door), I drive anything (Ye)
Buy my Range (Ye), make 'em go insane (Ye)

DJ EscoMoe City
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I got a halo
I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell (Wait)
Half of y'all might need help (Wait)
I might fall in Rodeo (Bitch)
I might ball in Australia (Say no more)
I might call her for real (Say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows and I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4,
know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a Create-A-Player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions and put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (It's deep, it's deep, it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep (I can't sleep, I can't sleep)
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (Swear to God, swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (Swear to God, swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (It's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (Get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (How many?)
Take the mask off so you can see
[Chorus: Future]
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Big foreigns)
Percocets (Ya), molly, Percocets (Big foreigns)
Rep the set (Yee), gotta rep the set (Gang, gang)
Chase a check (Chase it), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches, big foreign)
Mask on (Off, ye), fuck it, mask off (Mask, big foreigns)
Mask on (Off, ye), fuck it, mask off (Mask, big foreigns)
Percocets (Ye), molly, Percocets (Big foreigns)
Chase a check (Chase it), never chase a bitch (Don't chase no bitches)
[Outro: Future]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
Vengeance is mine, said the Lord
