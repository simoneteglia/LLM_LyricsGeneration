[Verse]
Could this be Earth?
Could this be light?
Does this mean everything is going to be alright?
One look out my window, there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station
