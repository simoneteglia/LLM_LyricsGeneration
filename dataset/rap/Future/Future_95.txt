[Verse 1]
Seasons change
And I've tried hard just to soften you
Well, seasons change
But I've grown tired trying to change for you
'Cause I've been waiting on you
I've been waiting on you
'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh
I've been weighing on you
[Chorus]
As it breaks
The summer will wake
But the winter will wash what is left of the taste
As it breaks
The summer will warm
But the winter will crave what has gone
Will crave what has all gone away
[Verse 2]
People change
But you know some people never do
You know when people change
They gain a peace, but they lose one too
'Cause I've been hanging on you, ooh-ooh, ooh
I've been weighing on you
'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh
I've been hanging on you
[Chorus]
As it breaks
The summer will wake
But the winter will wash what is left of the taste
As it breaks
The summer will warm
But the winter will crave what has gone
Will crave what has gone
Will crave what has all gone away
[Outro]
'Cause I've been waiting on you
