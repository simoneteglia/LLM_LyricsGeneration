[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Keep the bitch ju-u-ump, keep it on ju-u-ump (Jump)
Keep the bitch ju-u-ump
I caught it cool, for a ten
The bitch get loose, she tryna win
I beat her by the house, I beat her in
There's forty in the couch, I let her spend
[Verse 1: Don Toliver]
When the car's lit, better call in
She done popped all out, she done called twin
I done went too spazzed out, I put the raw in
I done hit the strip club and spent a tall ten
Lil' shawty off the Clicquot
She been comin' hot just like a hеat stroke (Heat stroke)
I could see you lurkin' through thе peephole
I'm stackin' different money, type of C notes
(C notes)
I'm talkin' C notes, nigga, hit C notes
[Pre-Chorus: Don Toliver]
You spend what you want and you get what you want
I guess you got what you wanted
You're hittin' the pole and you give it your all
Now, you keepin' it honest (Yeah)
It's too many nights I went nameless
It's too many nights I went famous
It's too many nights I went brainless
Sayin', "Uh-uh-uh-uh" (Yeah)
Let's get dru-u-unk
[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Keep the bitch ju-u-ump (Keep jump)
Keep the bitch ju-u-ump (Keep jump)
Keep the bitch—
I caught it cool, for a ten
The bitch get loose, she tryna win
I beat her out the house, I beat her in
There's money in the couch, I let her spend
[Verse 2: Don Toliver]
You made a hundred and you fall back
Need you on a call back
Knowin' that you're all that, bae
Oh, it's two-hundred on your dashboard
Stampin' out your passport
Ask me if I'm really okay
[Bridge: Don Toliver]
You get what you want, you want, you want
You get what you want, you want, you want
You get what you want, you want, you want
You get what you want, you want, you want
[Pre-Chorus: Don Toliver]
You spend what you want and you get what you want
I guess you got what you wanted
You're hittin' the pole and you give it your all
Now, you keepin' it honest (Yeah)
It's too many nights I went nameless
It's too many nights I went famous
It's too many nights I went brainless
Sayin', "Uh-uh-uh-uh" (Yeah)
Let's get dru-u-unk
[Chorus: Don Toliver]
Keep it on ju-u-ump (Jump)
Keep it on ju-u-ump
[Interlude: Don Toliver]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Keep it on ju-u-ump)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Keep it on ju-u-ump)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Keep it on ju-u-ump)
Ooh-ooh (
Hahaha

[Outro: Future]
Bottega Veneta whenever you ride with me
It ain't like I'm askin' you to ride for free
From trappin' to rappin', need to be proud of me (Proud of me)
Pack out the studio and throw parties (Throw parties)
Money comin' too fast, I can't slow it (I can't slow it)
Feel like I'm runnin' from my past, I can't slow down
Too many nights, 'bout to crash (Skrrt)
Now I'm buyin' the foreigns, all cash
I can't slow down
