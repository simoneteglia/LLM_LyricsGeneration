[Intro: Drake]
If anybody know
I know
Yeah
[Chorus: Drake]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
[Verse 1: Drake]
Aw yeah, Magic City on a Monday
Esco treat that shit like church on Sunday
Niggas look at us like, "Maybe one day"
Maybe one day, maybe one day
But for now, a nigga got the ones with me
I be in the club with the bands like I got the keyboard and the drums with me
Maybe one day, maybe one day
You'll understand how I get it, though
Man, it's everything I ever said it is
Mixin' liquor cups with the sedatives
I roll up with the bands on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me
This a good night to dance on me, yeah
[Chorus: Drake]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
[Verse 2: Future]
Yeah, last time they seen this shit was BMF
I know Big Meech and J-Bo, they was there
I know OG, India, and Suga there, aw yeah, aw yeah
Bust it out the wrapper, throw it in the air, aw yeah, aw yeah
Throwed enough money on a Monday than you make in a year, aw yeah
Ordered sixty thousand ones, told the owner 'bout to break a record
Hit the parking lot, it's lookin' like a video
Bunch of pretty hoes, high saddity hoes
Whole lot of Xans and we pass around candy
Magic City on a Monday, we worship this like a Sunday
Aw yeah
[Chorus: Future]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead, pick up all the cash
Go ahead, pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead, pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
[Chorus: Drake]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
Go ahead and pick up all the cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
[Chorus: Future]
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead, pick up all this cash
Go ahead, pick up all this cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
Get a plastic bag
Go ahead, get a plastic bag
Go ahead, pick up all this cash
You danced all night, girl, you deserve it
