I sleep on a beach off the avenue (The avenue)

Fuck all these bitches, I keep 'em comin' (Foreign)
I pull up right now, I'm parallel (Skrrt)
I hit your block with them swangers (I hit 'em)
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers (Throw up)
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
These niggas can't come around here 'cause it's dangerous
(Wizard)

I get focused on millions and everything (Focused)

You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in (Yeah)
I was born to get this money in this life of sin (Life of sin)
I poured up before they got my dawg on murder again (Murder)
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini (Skrrt)
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it? (No)
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treated me (Hah)
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons (Oh)
[Chorus: Future]
I did the digital dash (Fuck)
I fucked that bitch on the passenger (Fuck)

Hot on the street like thermometers (Thermometers)
You rats'll never be honorable (Fuck 'em)
They know I'ma keep that my word (They know)
I hustle the first to the first (I hustle)
[Verse 2: Drake]
These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again
I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again and again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what an entrance
That's when you know it's a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas to just make the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on they neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, your shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I
[Outro: Future]
I did the digital dash (Woo)
I fucked that bitch in the passenger
I gave that junky a blast
I sell that dope to your mama, though
