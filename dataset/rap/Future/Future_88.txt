[Intro: Future]
Saggin'
out the malls, we do the most, oh
Had a
ratchet
in my coat, got a girl doin’ coke
[Chorus: Future]
We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean
[Verse 1: Future]
When I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked
If you always there for me, that's a rеally good look
I’m changin' up your salary 'cause I'm gettin' to know you
Tell mе your availability, I want all of you
If it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning
I stack it up, get feisty, can’t sabotage it or ice it
You gon’ tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy
You're a good girl but you’re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates
I let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body
Me and cheap girls stay cheap, we
do numbers
, stay fly
If it's gettin’ to you, then we fast forward, yeah
Stayin' low like a stash house, yeah
Bando to bando, traphouse, yeah
Made it with nothin', learned to swag out, yeah
Can't be defeated, I got mad sauce, yeah
Why would I front like it ain't my fault?
[Chorus: Future]
Drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean
[Post-Chorus: Future]
She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean
Yelled, "Jesus Christ," but I wasn't causin' commotion
Hit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah
[Interlude: Future]
Hit it all night, we was drinkin' and smokin' (Yeah)
Drinkin' and smokin'
[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I done went from GG to BB to LV
I done fucked with Kiki and Lili and Nini
I text her "So proud of you" when I got my B from CC
It is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
She said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth
Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed
I don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze
Man, I read her text, she said, "Girl, I creamed"
Man, I know she duckin' off with her side me
Who you know gon'
hit it raw
, baby, besides me?
[Chorus: Future]
We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turn me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean
[Post-Chorus: Future]
She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean
Yelled, "Jesus Christ," but I wasn't causin' commotion
Hit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah
