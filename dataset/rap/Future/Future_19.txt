[Intro: Future]
Yeah
Uh
Future
Wakin' (
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus: Future]
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
(Freebandz)
I go so hard with these riches
(Freebandz)
I fell in love with this dodie (I did)
I fell in love with the Rollie (Yeah)
I wake up, pray every morning (Pray)
These demons, they callin' my soul (Hold up)
I said fuck all of you hoes (Hold up)
I'm ballin' outta control (I'm ballin')
I'm ballin' outta control (Let's ball)
[Post-Chorus: Future]
If I could give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever need (All that)
For me to move on and succeed (All that)
For me to move on and succeed (All that)
Jealousy, envy, and greed (Hah)
Too much of this shit, I don't need it
[Verse 1: Future]
I turned on the gas with a nickel-plated (I did)
I sit back and laugh 'cause these niggas traitors (Hahaha)
Mentally, none of this shit can faze me (Mentally)
Mentally, none of this shit can faze me (Yeah)
I came out the trenches, I really made it (I really did)
I came out the gutter, I really made it (Sure I did)
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
(Freebandz)
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it (Gang)
Shoot out the carbine, no lovey-dovey (Facts)
These bitches, they lookin' for hubby-hubby (Hubby-hubby)
I'm lookin' for paper in any city (I swear)
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have them sticks on us in every city (I swear)
Take the private 'cause lately, out here, we gettin' it (Yeah)
Spent like seven-hundred thousand on both the Bentleys (Skrrt)
I got love for the city, I jugg and get it (Yeah)
[Chorus: Drake &
Future

I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money, man, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin' my soul (
Hold up
)
I said fuck all of you hoes (Hold up)
I'm ballin' outta control (I'm ballin')
I'm ballin' outta control (Let's ball out)
I'm ballin' outta control (I'm ballin')
I'm ballin' outta control (Let's—)
[Verse 2: Drake]
I need acknowledgement (Need it)
If I got it, then tell me I got it then (Tell me)
I'm ballin' outta control (Ballin')
Keep on receiving the scholarships (Woo)
Mayor comin' to the house (Woo)
Nigga, please, watch your mouth (Watch it)
I'm the one without a doubt (Watch it), yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choosed by these hoes
Usually, they just leave when we done
I don't wan' share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change, yeah
[Chorus: Future]
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
(Freebandz)
I go so hard with these riches
(Freebandz)
I fell in love with this dodie (I did)
I fell in love with the Rollie (Yeah)
I wake up, pray every morning (Pray)
These demons, they callin' my soul (Hold up)
I said fuck all of you hoes (Hold up)
I'm ballin' outta control (I'm ballin')
