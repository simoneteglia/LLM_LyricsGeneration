[Intro: Future]
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer
Draped in all designer, draped in all designer
Yeah
[Verse 1: Future]
I got all exotic bitches, you gon' think I'm racist, yeah
I just called a gang of bitches out of immigration, uh
You gon' think we printin' money 'cause the way we make it, uh
I got all these fuckin' whips and ain't got no payments
[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Pink slip sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really, ayy
[Verse 2: Future]
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
I dropped a few whoop-da-whoops in my cup
Put it on my tab, put her on my tab
Franchise tag on me, Bron Bron
Steph Curry wrist, nigga, Oakland
Perkies for the bitch in Magic, Don Juan
Standing ovation and an encore
And I keep a check, Nike Concord
[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Pink slip sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really, ayy
[Chorus: Future]
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
[Verse 3: Drake]
Whole time, I was ready
They was like, "Hold up, wait a minute"
I was like, "Nah, nigga, let's get it"
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here tryna take somethin', there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thang, I got Summer P in this thang
I just dropped a jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Yeah, yeah, up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit comin' in May
We doing three hundred records a day
Who really think they can get in the way?
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter, they hurtin'
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving (Skrrt)
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowin' up like it's urgent (Brrt)
And she was actin' like a virgin (Nah)
I gave it to her, then I curved her
[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Pink slip sitting in the dashboard with me
Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really, ayy
[Chorus: Future]
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
