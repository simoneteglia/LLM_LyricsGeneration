[Intro: Future]
Hendrix
Yeah
Aqua
Ah
(I woke up like this)
[Chorus: Future]
Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch
[Verse 1: Future]
Reportin' live from the gutter
I'll buy this motherfucker, talkin' big money shit, bitch
Straight up out the gutter, never had shit
Now we got 90210 on our address
Talking ten mil' just to get our assets
I know them tears still fallin' now on my last bitch
This money make me hungry, I'm a savage
I seen the stars lining up, you couldn't imagine
I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, counted up and started laughing, ah
I went back inside the attic, counted up and started laughing, ah
(Freebandz)
Ah, Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house, I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see hell everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't start drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean, my niggas still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pool sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just pay they bills now
Money make her feel good, but damn she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe, but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar
[Chorus: Future]
Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money shit
I ain't talkin' nothin' but big money, bitch
[Verse 2: Drake]
Reporting live from the gutter
I will buy this motherfucker, it's not even a discussion, woo
And I got my niggas with me, yeah, yeah
She gon' end up dippin' with me, yeah, yeah
And I got her trippin' off the yah-yah
Pillow talking, dishing out on all y'all, yeah
In one ear and out the other
Shut your mouth and take what's coming
Live from the gutter, dawg, yeah, yeah
She don't want pets, but I'm a dog, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dawg, yeah, yeah
And she love it, dawg, yeah, yeah
On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit
Soon as night fall, that's when we lock in
This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dawgs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks, woo
And we gon' miss you
They don't want no smoke, they don't want no issue
But these the times we gotta live through
But these the times we gotta live through, and I'm
[Chorus: Future]
Reportin' live from the fuckin' gutter, bitch
I ain't talkin' but some big money shit
Reportin' live from the damn gutter
Swear to God, I'll buy this motherfucker, ah
