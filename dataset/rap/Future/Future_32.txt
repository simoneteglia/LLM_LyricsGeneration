[Intro: Future]
Yeah
You know how nights like this go
(OVOFBG)
[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Sixty naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitress
When you gettin' a lot of money, you can't help but save it
[Chorus: Drake]
But tonight, me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends, we got money to spend
[Verse 1: Future]
This Adderall got me to the ceiling (I'm to the ceiling and I)
I think them Percocets had me in my feelings (In my feelings and I)
I peel them hundreds on hundreds
I get that money on money
I get that guala on guala
I get them dollars on dollars
Then throw out them dollars, them bitches gon' holler
I got more style than the stylists
I like that money is piling
I see that money just piling
I see it's piling and piling and piling and piling and piling and piling
We do the favors, them bitches gon' cater
We fuck the models, then we fuck the neighbors
Fucked all the strippers, then we fuck the waitress, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Sixty naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitress
When you gettin' a lot of money, you can't help but save it
[Chorus: Drake]
But tonight, me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends, we got money to spend
[Verse 2: Drake]
Two in the morning, my mind is on you
Four in the morning, it still hasn't moved
Hit me to tell me you get off at ten
Come here, I make sure you get off again
Roxx got a case, but they get off again
Fuck all the opps and the shots that they send
I let off first, then I let off again
You will not hear from them ever again
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Reps Up, you know there's a hundred of them
FBGOVO, hundred percent
Don't ask me shit when it come to my set
Don't ask me shit when it come to my set
FBGOVO, hundred percent, yeah
Six summers straight and I run it again
[Pre-Chorus: Future]
Sixty naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Smashing all the models, now we hit the waitress
When you gettin' a lot of money, you can't help but save it
[Chorus: Drake]
But tonight, me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, we got money to spend
Me and my friends, me and my friends, we got money to spend
[Outro: Future]
Sixty naked bitches, no exaggeration
We bought all the bottles, had to change locations
Take it to the head, baby, penetration
Money not a problem, you can finger trace it
Drinking on the syrup, taking medications
After this club, we just change locations
After this club, we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locations
We don't take it in, we just change locations
