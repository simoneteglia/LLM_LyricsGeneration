[Intro]
Smoke
Ty Beats (Ty)
[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Back in this bitch mothafucka', yeah it's me
SpaceGhostPurrp and I put your bitch to sleep
Me and my twin at it again with this phonk
Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk
RIP to Screw,
rest in peace to Pimp C
Shout out to the H
and that fucking SUC
My fucking brain is purple, nigga
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (ASAP, swag, swag, swag)
I said
everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It be that pretty mothafucka' sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol, my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin 4s since back in 06
Won't you see a nigga getting throat bitch?
Two middle fingers to the showbiz
Cause they selfish and they show bus'
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish
I be the fly young fella (Yeah) Maison Martin Margiela (Uh)
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella,
I go and tell her
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said
everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
Uh, all hell here, bitch it's Satan talking
Told her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain (rain)? Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus, go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way
A hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper
Smoking on purple, bitch, I'm dangerous, nasty crazy
90s baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement
Hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways
So fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? (Yeah) I'm chasing this paper
That's purple, nigga
