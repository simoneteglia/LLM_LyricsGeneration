[Intro: Scarface]
"Mo—money and the power, money and the power"
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky &
Dean Blunt
]
Eyedrops,
("Fuckin' with the killas")
Teardrops
Droptops,
("Fuckin' with the killas")
Ice blocks
(Beat drop, beat drop)
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I was thinking to myself (Calldrops)
Maybe I should seek some help
Maybe I should blame myself ("Don't expect no money")
My mystique in stealth is gone away
("Don't expect no money")
It's going away, it's going away
[Chorus: Dean Blunt]
Eye drops
Teardrops
Droptops
Ice blocks
[Interlude: A$AP Rocky &
Kodak Black
]
You used to be so soft
This is a prepaid collect call from
("Fuckin' with the killas")
Beautiful teardrops on your cheeks
An inmate at Florida Correctional Institution
Beautiful things
This call is subject to recording and monitoring
This-this life situation and shit, you there?
Uh-huh
You ready right now?
Yeah, I'm ready, got you on speaker
[Verse 2: Kodak Black &
A$AP Rocky
]
All the pain I went through
Turned to a singer
I put it all on my tattoos
'Cause of where I came from
If I ain't ever learned before, then it's gon' change me
(This call is subject to recording and monitoring)
Sittin' in institution, I  done lost my baby
If nan' ain't ever woke me up, then it's gon' wake me
When them people ran up on my spot, and they took my baby
A random kind that's doing his time, but it's for no reason
A random kind that's ridin' the pine
, something you free—something you free—something you free
(This call has dropped, to add more credits, please press 1)

Free Kodak
