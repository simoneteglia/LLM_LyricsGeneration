[Part I]
[Intro: ASAP Rocky &
MGMT
]
Changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through
changes
Always changin' faces
I'm goin' through phases
I'm goin' through changes
Changes
I'm goin' through changes
All those changin' faces
I'm goin' through phases
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Love comes with a price tag and a barcode
Still love you when we
part though
Blame me like it's my fault
Still o-, still okay
Walk around like your heart cold
Hop around like your parkour
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay (changes)
Still o-, still o-
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky &
Devonté Hynes
]
Look, I got a text from this girl I used to see
Sayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with
Look, I apologize, but this message fucked me up
Then I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, "Best of luck to ya"
Fast forward couple months I'm like, "Wassup witcha?"
'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it (Feel it)
But really it's been a lil' minute
Ain't nothin' changed but the address
My neighbors hate how I be livin' (Livin')
Mad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'
Like fuck all the other tenants (Runnin')
Bought mines, boy, you rentin' (Runnin')
Rich niggas in their feelings (Runnin')
Bitch niggas in their feelings (Woo)
Bags packed, knapsack packed like I'm leavin' home
They ain't wanna let me go, I guess you need me more
I was on the road on tour (Tour)
She just said I changed for the worst (
She just said I changed
)
Rain flags, rain backs, fact guess you need it more
Had to let your heart go, I guess you need it more
[Bridge 2: A$AP Rocky and
MGMT
]
I'm going through changes
Sweetest smile
Always changing phases
Upside down
I'm going through phases
I'll be cruel to you
I'm going through changes
Don't know if you love me or not
[Part II]
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
These ain't monkey bars from no fuckin' kiddy parks
Itchin' with the chicky pox, nigga
Shittin' on 'em, need my litty box
Mink on, see the fox
(Oh, that's how you feel, nigga)
'03 Bentley Park, by the candy shop, Vicky, Vicky Fox
Time to give them what they want
Rakim Allah mixed with Biggie, Pac
Weird nigga from the block, ugh
Square bitches give me box, ugh
She pussy pop to Iggy Pop
You pussy niggas really pop
[Bridge 3: A$AP Rocky &
Devonté Hynes
]
Thanks for the light, waitin' for the light
Changes
Change for a lifetime (What a wonderful life)
Thanks for the night, drinks for the night
Changes
Waitin' for the right time (What a wonderful life)
(Changed for the better changed for the worse)
So far I done been and feelin' change, changes
So far I done been and feelin' change, changes
[Part III]
[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
My biggest distraction is that I get distracted
People suing me for shit that didn't happen
I wonder how the world would be if they didn't have me
(Fuck this shit)
Wake up to my explore page
See my exes engaged, or either gettin' married
Or had a baby with some nigga
Or either three months, post-natal, postin' up that little nigga papi
I wonder if they really happy or just gettin' at me
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & MGMT]
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Changes
Goin' through changes
Goin' through changes
Goin' through changes
