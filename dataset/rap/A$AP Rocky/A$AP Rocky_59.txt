[Intro]
Yeah
Fake homies do turn to fake phony dudes
Let me find out that you phony too
Yeah, fake homies do turn to fake—
[Chorus]
Roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch
Hold my gun, load it up, count my slugs (That's my bitch)
Yeah, they don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my bitch (That's my bitch)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup (That's my bitch)
They don't know nothin' (That's my bitch)
[Post-Chorus]
Roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch, rub my gut
Rub yo' butt, be my slut, be my cunt, yeah, so what?
Fuck them hoes (That's my bitch)
They don't know nothin' (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck they talk 'bout? (That's my bitch)
'Cause they don't know nothin'
[Verse 1]
Time to call it what it was, first I thought it wasn't nothin'
Probably think I wanna hit and run, bad girls wanna have fun
I don't want no Goody Two-Shoes, no nun
I ain't no priest, I ain't gon' preach
I didn't want no goodie-goodie, but she still praise Jesus
I share my clothes with my bitch like shе my sis
I don't beat my bitch, I need my bitch
She clean my crib, shе feed my friends
She keep my secret, she keep my fridge packed, my freezer lit
That's how deep I get, negative degrees
What's the type of bitch I need?
[Chorus]
Roll my-roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch (That's my bitch)
Hold my-hold my, load it up, count my slugs (That's my bitch)
Yeah, they don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my bitch (That's my bitch)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup (That's my bitch)
They don't know-They don't know
[Post-Chorus]
Roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch, rub my gut
Rub yo' butt, be my slut, be my cunt, yeah, so what?
Fuck them hoes (That's my bitch) They don't know nothin' (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck they talk 'bout? (That's my bitch)
'Cause they don't know nothin'
[Verse 2]
She got bank accounts too
With big amounts, shit you couldn't count
Just pick the number that you couldn't count to
Like an attitude, curve a nigga when she didn't have to
Around the lords like a British council
With all these sticks around you
We can build you a wooden castle
Got a penthouse, see the Bronx Zoo
Got a townhouse with the town view
Got surround sound with the top down
Ride through
Allerton up to Soundview
I was lost then but I found you
Little slim thick with a bounce too
It's your tough love that I'm bound to
I fuck it up, then it's round two
[Chorus]
Roll my, roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch (That's my bitch)
Hold my, hold my, load it up, count my slugs (That's my bitch)
Yeah, they don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, be my bitch (That's my bitch)
They don't know nothin'
Roll my blunt, fill my cup (That's my bitch)
They don't know-They don't know
[Post-Chorus]
Roll my blunt, fill my cup, be my bitch, rub my gut
Rub yo' butt, be my slut, be my cunt, yeah, so what?
Fuck them hoes (That's my bitch) They don't know nothin' (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck they talk 'bout? 'Cause they don't know nothin'

Felt full since our first encounter (My first encounter)
And baby (

Don't let another nigga try my baby
Girl you know I'm one call away
(I wish a nigga would, I'm one phone call away)
It's nothin' (Tsch, this shit ain't nothin', baby)
And baby (
I fell in love with you

My angel and my Goddess, when my head get clouded
(My head get cloudy, my thoughts get cloudy)
You're my soulmate, my Goddess (My soulmate)
And baby (
I fell in love with you

Took a little time in a gray place (
I fell in love with you
)
For nothing, nothing

Fuck they talkin' 'bout? 'Cause they don't know nothin' (Yeah)
