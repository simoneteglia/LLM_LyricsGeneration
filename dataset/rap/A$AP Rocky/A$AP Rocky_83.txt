[Intro: slowthai]
Yeah, yeah
Jesus Christ
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
[Chorus: slowthai]
Mazzalean (Mazzalean)
When I'm pulling up, muddy dungarees (Yeah, huh?)
Make the place look like a murder scene (Murder)
Ayy, when I make moves, I'm a money fiend (Money, yeah)
[Verse 1: slowthai]
Suicidal tendencies, what's up, man? (Bang, bang)
Feel like I'm down, I say, "What's up?"
Way too, way too, way too gully, give me money (Give me it all)
Cannot trust me, no one ever fuckin' buss me change
(Buss me, buss me, buss me, buss me, buss me)
Look how shit changed
Feeling like these drugs made me better than I was
But I never felt love before the drugs
So, now I say, "What's up? What's up? What's up?"
"What's up? What's up? What's up?"
Say, "What's up?
"
Failed to revert to my old ways
Cricket tickets, stacks of cocaine
Sticky fingers, shoplifters
We got tools like Homebase
Lift a finger, dug his own grave (Yeah)
Same, same with the same name (Yeah)
Closed case, red wine, no ros√©
Do genocide for the whole gang (Gang, gang)
You're telling lies, now I'm energised, I'm more precise
Walk in, made a Big Bang (Yeah)
Propane with the Roxanne (Brr)
Gin and tonic, I'm a bigger topic (Yeah)
Bigger pocket, can't close my wallet (Blah)
Quicker blotting, like my name's Sonic
Glass homes, we stone chucking
[Chorus: slowthai]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mazzalean (Mazzalean)
When I'm pulling up, muddy dungarees (Yeah, huh?)
Ayy, make the place look like a murder scene (Murder)
Ayy, when I make moves, I'm a money fiend (Money, yeah)
[Post-Chorus: slowthai]
Ayy, make the place look like a murder scene
Ayy, when I make moves, I'm a money fiend
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Olive, body shaped like a bottle
Popeye off of spinach
Pop a model 'til she wallow, uh
Drop her toddler off, damn
Light a flame, toss a Molotov
Drop it off, then I Mazel Tov
Pop a whole god-dang champagne bottle cork
Still might find me in a mosh pit
And I still ain't even corporate
Walked in with who I work with (Yeah)
Yeah, run up on you while you're jogging
Make you listen to my Walkman
Mixtape shit, streams never seen
Make a whole boat sink (Yeah, listen, bitch)
Watch all the hoes pay attention when I walk in (Yeah)
Stroll in like an old man (Damn)
Like I popped like four Xans (Yeah)
Niggas acting like close friends (Yeah)
Fame, don't even know mans (Nah)
Tell the kids I'm a grown man
Pop two steps, slow dance (Yeah)
Woo, woo, woo
Got jokes uptown, Harlem world
New York like I'm Pop Smoke
Riding 'round in the drop rolls
Watching rats in the pot roast
Finger polish with the top coat
The bottom platinum but the top gold
Bling, bling, that's a barcode
Ring, ring, that's a smartphone
Beep, beep, there your heart go
slowthai, here your part go
[Chorus: slowthai]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mazzalean (Mazzalean)
When I'm pulling up, muddy dungarees (Yeah, huh?)
Ayy, make the place look like a murder scene (Murder)
Ayy, when I make moves, I'm a money fiend (Money, yeah)
[Outro: slowthai]
Different goals
On the street, play different roles
