Stoned-stoned when I'm in my zoney-zone
Smokin' on the homegrown, feeling like I'm all alone
Used to go to Kingdome, Rucker Park with Tony Tone
(Harlem!)
Listenin' to Bone Bone, feelins in my bone bone
[Post-Chorus: A$AP Rocky &
Puff Daddy
]
I can tell it
I could give a fuck about a list, ya heard? (
Ya heard?
)
I could give a fuck about a diss, ya heard? (
Ya heard?

I could give a fuck about your clique, ya heard? (
Ya heard?

Shut the fuck up 'fore I rock your bitch, ya heard? Uh

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky &
Puff Daddy
]
My mama named me, my papa gave me cock to take a piss with
To fuck ya bitch with
,
life is different for me, for instance
The type of niggas spray his kids in some chicks
He wouldn't raise his kids with, that type of twisted sick shit
Come on, man
[Interlude: Akia Harvey &
Puff Daddy
]
What you say, nigga? Time's out
Let's start over with this conversation
You sound super crazy right now
And I got my two kids listenin'? (
I'm just playing

You said what? (
I said I'm just-

Uh-uh, nigga, you got me fucked up

Shut the fuck up 'fore I rock your bitch, ya heard?
Shut the fuck up!
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky &
Puff Daddy
]
People really think I'm an asshole, I say anything
(C'mon)
Truthfully, I just say what I really think
Like I'm too fresh, man, to be an under-class-man
(Too fresh)
Would say, "Suck my dick"â€”but that's sexual harassment
(Take that, let's go!)
Fuck around and really come through in a murse on ya
(Come on)
Who else you know design ya stage and do your merch over? (
Come on
)
And if you lame, do your verse over
(Yeah)
I changed the game like I'm Kurt Warner
(Yeah, keep going)
I run the game like I'm Time Warner
(Yeah)
This ain't no Teen Choice Awards, slime slide on ya
(Keep goin', yeah)
And make it home for mama's fried roasting
Had leans and Beams, tomatoes, Mercedes
Had keys and grams, just me and Yams
(Yea
h, com
e on)
[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
And Stevie rest in peace
Pickin' off the last collard greens
, stress up outta me
Now we sellin' out the Coliseum for the dynasty
Tell them boys who got it locked and got the key
You gotta see behind the scenes or in the streets (A$AP)
