[Chorus 1]
Uh, goddamn
How real is this?
I know them Harlem
Niggas gon' be feelin' this
East Coast nigga (Uh)
But how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit
My ignorance is still a bliss
Uh, goddamn
How real is this?
I know them Harlem
Niggas gon' be feelin' this
East Coast nigga (Uh)
But how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit
My ignorance is still a bliss
(Uh)
[Verse]
Stone-cold love
Rose gold slugs
I could afford it
I imported stone-cold drugs
Stone cold
Rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone
I was stoned, nigga
Don't remember me
As a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sippin'
Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston
Hear it in my music (Yeah)
A trill nigga to the truest
Show you how to do this
My all gold grills
Give her cold chills
Said she got a coke feel
'Cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy
Scale, but I sold pills
No deal
Put her on her feet, toenails
Them vampires, them bloodsuckers
Them thirsty killers
We 'bout it, 'bout it
We rowdy, rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill
Don't sport Chinchilla
My bounty hunter's
A bounty killer, I'm 'bout my skrilla
Gimme the title then gimme the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity-wickity-wack
Like Kriss Kross,
her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal
We smokin' that, thinkin' we're burnin' the hash
Puff it and pass, makin' it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, makin' 'em crash
Snuck it and snatched it, ain't givin' it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame
This is real life
An insight to my
Trill life,
Clams
[Chorus 2]
Uh, goddamn
How real is this?
I know the whole
World gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga
Boy, how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit
My ignorance is still a bliss
Uh, goddamn
How real is this?
I know the whole
World gon' be feelin' this
Uh, goddamn
How real is this?
I know the whole
World gon' be feelin' this
Uh, goddamn
How real is this?
I know the whole
World gon' be feelin' this
Uh, goddamn
How real is this?
I know the whole
World gon' be feelin' this
