[Intro]
Olympicks—Olympicks—Olympicks—
Olympicks
Uh, alright
[Verse]
Get money addict, I'ma get "Money" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A,
Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post, while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna
, and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy, but Rocky been jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met Jay Hov
(Who dat? ASAP)
But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a
Juice
scene
No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in my new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing
Nigga, I do things,
let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne
(Uh)
Fly kicks, my shit (Uh) yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money,
so save the bullshit for the Q-tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin' on the block like Whoo Kid
A$AP standing on the block like the new kids
[Outro]
Uhh, A$AP nigga, uhh, uhh
Alright, yeah
A$AP nigga, uhh
Alright, alright
