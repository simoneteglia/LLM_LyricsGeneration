[Intro: Imogen Heap &
A$AP Rocky
]
Do just what I tell you (
Uh
)
Don't come in any closer (
Uh
)
And no one will get hurt
'Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two (
Uh
)
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Out— Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André (Uh)
Beef is on my entrée (Yeah)
,
gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way (Uh)
Pussy on a Sunday (Yeah), business on a Monday (Yeah)
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet's like a runway (Uh)
Come be my fiancée, she fucked me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe (Yeah)
Dinner date for one K (Bitch), shopping date for two K (Bitch)
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days (Yeah)
Finally got it today (Uh), swear to God my mood changed (Uh)
Top off like toupees, drive off, touché (Bitch,
uh
)
Yeah— Yeah, my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy (Yeah)
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy (Uh)
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holler at a nigga, G (Yeah)
Ridin' on my enemies (Yeah), this my ghetto symphony (
Uh
, uh, yeah), 'ny
Uh
(Uh),
uh
(Yeah)
Uh
(Uh, yeah)
[Chorus: Imogen Heap &
Rick James
]
Sing
Louder
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
[Verse 2: Gunplay &
A$AP Rocky
]
Whip— Whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and lockin' up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news, I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel (
Uh
)
Before I get aggressive, forget it, war-ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that (
Uh
)
Black magic on the tires, only I
Roll— Rollin' down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain, it may slow me down, cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain, I came to reign from here forward
Still 'noid, so the crib got clear doors
Burnin' planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports
(
Uh
)
[Chorus: Imogen Heap,
Rick James
&
A$AP Ferg
]
Sing
Louder
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer (
Uh
)
[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Since Rocky spit like André
I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée
Eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a 'roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking, how fast you could grip a nine?
Damn
Look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in, lift and shine
Tip-tip and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times your eyes seen a nigga die?
Never
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga
