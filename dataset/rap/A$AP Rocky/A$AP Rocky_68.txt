[Intro]
Uh, pain
Uh, pain
Uh, pain
Uh
[Refrain: A$AP Rocky]
So there you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call when no one else around
[Chorus]
It was a lights, camera, action, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
Lights, camera, action, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
Lights, camera, action, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
The future will be televised, haters gettin' genocide
Twenty-three and forty-three, I'm talking my Margiela size
My niggas is hella fly, you over-accessorize
Dead alive, it's in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, I'm a king, ask Coretta Scott
Cute face, fat ass, and a nice set of thighs
Rihanna weave, I need an umbrella, ella, ella, ah
[Verse 2: Kent Jamz]
Everybody knows me, shit, still ain't got no cash, bitch
Hit that flash quick, post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram, match a gram, Mando
Royal blue Foams, getting head in the red Lambo
Media take me out, TMZ all in the V.I.P.
Bitch, I'm hard and my Loop Concrete
Too much Bossip if you ask me
Almost fucked fame, but she came with money
I got two bad bitches, haters wanna take 'em from me
[Chorus]
It was a lights, camera, action, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
Lights, camera, action, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
Lights, camera, action, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love it, you love it)
[Verse 3: Tube]
Tryna get on in this industry, actin' like you (Ruthy)
Breakin' down cocaine with an EBT (Oh yeah)
These male groupies doin' it
However, whatever they seein' on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot
Everybody's an artist (Everybody not)
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talkin' dollars, gettin' change
In a minute, I'ma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I'm cutthroat, so what goals
Do you have for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within
[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, through the glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto goals, want me pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that Bathing Ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch, it's Hammer time
Getting dirty money, but I keep my hand sanitized
Li-life is what you need, won't you take a Z? Feel the breeze
Smoke the Sour Diese', hit that shit and please act at ease
What you wanna be? Like The Black Eyed Peas, all these steeze
S-T-A-R-S
, Hollywood,
won't you rest in peace?
[Refrain: A$AP Rocky]
So there you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call when no one else around
