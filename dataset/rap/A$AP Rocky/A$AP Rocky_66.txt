[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, uh
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I thought you said you'd never leave (Leave)
I think back as I took a puff (Puff)
Know what happens every time you leave (Leave)
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuck
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuss
Holdin' back, ain't no turnin' back when you fall in love (Love)
Know what happens every time you speed (Speed)
Always fall flat 'cause you wanna rush (Rush)
Huh? So we could take it slow (Slow)
Separate the highs from the lows (Lows)
Separate the evens from the odds (Odds)
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart
[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever (
Yeah
)
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I'm here to say I
May have even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure ('Dure)
If you fly away then rest assured
[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever
[Bridge: Florence Welch]
You're the eye, but I'm tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I'm never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart
[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
You made a bet with me, now you're in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It's ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude, but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin' 'gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I'm in her heart on her left titty
[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever (Can't last forever)
Can't last forever
[Outro: Florence Welch]
I come apart (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I come apart (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
