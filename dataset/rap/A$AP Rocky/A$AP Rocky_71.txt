[Chorus: Roisee,
Young
Thug
]
Not done fightin'
I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'?
Is there more like us?
Got me feelin'
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten
But I can't give up
I'm still fightin' (
Metro
)
I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'?
Is there more like us?
Got me feelin'
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten
But I can't give up
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, wakin' up, feelin' like the thankful one
Count up my ones, lacin' up my favorite 1s
One-of-a-kind, one of one, the only one
Got one shot and one chance to take it once
Kiss my mama on the forehead, 'forе I get the code rеd
'Cause I was born, bred to go in, toast ready
Swing by 410, beef patty, cornbread
In the concrete jungle, where my home is
All get focused, all raise your toastes
The nickname: Mr. Keen-To-Do-the-Mostest
I was livin' down bad in my folks' crib
Now I'm laughin' to the bank and the joke is
Did more things than folks did, or folks get
We been gettin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends coexist
They love to mix, and we know what it is
[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fightin'
I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'?
Is there more like us?
Got me feelin'
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten
But I can't give up
I'm still fightin'
I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'?
Is there more like us?
Got me feelin'
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten
But I can't give up
[Verse 2: Roisee]
I can't find it in myself
To just walk away
I can't find it in myself
To lose everything
Feel everyone's against me, don't
Want me to be great
Things might look bad, not afraid
To look death in the face
I'm good now (Now, now)
Who's really bad?
I choose me now (Now, now)
What's wrong with that?
Wish you could see me now, now
Mmm, who had my back?
Ain't belong, no love lost
Good always will win
[Chorus: Roisee]
Not done fightin' (Fightin')
I don't feel I've lost (Feel I've)
Am I dreamin'? (Dreamin')
Is there more like us?
(More like)
Got me feelin' (Feelin')
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten (Beaten)
But I can't give up (Can't give)
I'm still fightin'
I don't feel I've lost
Am I dreamin'?
Is there more like us?
Got me feelin'
Like it's all too much
I feel beaten
But I can't give up (Can't give)
[Outro: Roisee]
Up
Can't give, can't give
Up
Can't give, can't give
Up
Can't give, can't give
Up
Can't give up
