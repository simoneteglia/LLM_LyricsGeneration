Mama told me, "Go and get it" (Mama)

Cluckin' chicken (Yeah), gotta watch out for the pork (Yeah, yeah, uh)
That's the most important part (Yeah, uh)
Started out, we was only makin' art (Yeah, uh)
Gotta say it from your heart (Yeah)
Most of you niggas lack that, get backstabbed
Bodybag, toe tag, worst body parts in the cast
Smash that, Glock and gloves, mask that
Shorty asked my Apple Pay and CashApp (
Hol' up

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Why we greedy like wolves?
Adam, Eve with the fruit
Why we need new new?
Only got two seats, why we need new coupe?
Only got two feet, why we need new shoes?
Papa need new shoe, baby need new shoes
I'ma need new shoes, Birkenstock, fifty Gs, new shoes
Metro got this shit boomin' (Boomin')
