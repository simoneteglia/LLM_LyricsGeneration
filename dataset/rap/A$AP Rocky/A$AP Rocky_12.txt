[Intro: A$AP Rocky &
Juicy J
]
Fuck niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply (
Yeah, real shit
)
Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply (
Mhm
)
Igh, igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh
[Interlude 1: Juicy J]
Yeah, nigga
It's your boy Juicy J
Man, you gotta watch out for these old backstabbin', broke-ass, you know what I'm sayin', jealous, hatin'-ass niggas out here, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
Man, these niggas ain't no real niggas, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas be smilin' in your face
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky &
Juicy J
]
Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Durag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
The one you be with be the one to shoot at you in a minute (
Yeah
)
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps (
Mmm
)
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
To the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel (
Yeah
)
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
(
Mhm
)
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill (
Uh
)
Nah, I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these motherfuckers better give me my props, word to Pac
Who the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed?
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold?
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive, he'd tell these hoes and these niggas
[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Even in my will, keep it trill to the day I peel (Mhm)
Even in my will, keep it trill to the day I peel (Mhm)
Even in my will, keep it trill to the day I peel (Mhm)
Even in my will, keep it trill to the day I—
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
[Interlude 2: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga (Uh, yeah)
I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?
Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag, swag, nigga (Uh)
Shut the fuck up
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck with a nigga like me (Woo), RIP my nigga Pimp C (Woo)
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that (Yeah)
Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back (Uh)
No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back (Yeah)
B-Boy with the G pack,
might fuck around and bring the mink back
Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga
If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga (Uh)
Fuck with a nigga like me (Woo), RIP my nigga Pimp C (Woo)
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that (Uh)
I'm a trendsetter, you ain't even peep that (Yeah)
Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at? (Uh)
Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that (Yeah)
(We ain't no fashion killers, nigga, we fashionable killers)
(Y'all got Flacko fucked up)
[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit
Don't I deserve just to brag a bit? (Yeah)
Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents
Number one stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate (Yeah)
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate (Uh)
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch (Yeah)
I think back to when pockets packin' lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp,
bitches lie, killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride
Prosper still and strive, to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch
[Outro: Juicy J &
A$AP Rocky
]
Fake-ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin'?
These niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man
Niggas be gettin' extorted like a motherfucker out here, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
To the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
To— to the day— peel— peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
