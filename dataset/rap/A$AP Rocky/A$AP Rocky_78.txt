[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, posted on the corner like a trapper, uh
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper? uh
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper? uh
(Testing, testing, uh-huh, listen)
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
My whole life I just wanted to be a rapper
Then I grewed up and the boy became a rapper
And my older sister made me wear the golden wrapper
She said, "Watch out, 'cause you know the hoes will trap ya"
[Break: A$AP Rocky &
BlocBoy JB
]
To the block—to—to—to the block
To the block, ayy, ayy, ayy
Don't know why
To the block—to—to—to the block
Word, word, word, word, word, word
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky &
BlocBoy JB
]
Got my first pager, that was 1998
Sneaking, talking to my girlfriend way up late (
Hello
)
Mama on the mothafuckin' line, "Boy, you cray"
I was trappin' since a young nigga by the way
Back, way back then, boy, I was a different dude (
Dude
)
Standing on the corner like I ain't got shit to do (
Do
)
Nowadays
(uh-huh)
feelin' like I ain't got shit to prove (
To prove
)
All the beef is lookin' minuscule (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
And I modeled Dior, but I'm still a rapper (
Yeah
)
Took a little detour, but I'm still a rapper (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Used to be a D-boy but I'm still a rapper
My whole life I was livin' like a trapper (
Trapper
)
Shacked next to Casanova, locked up on the island
I don't brag about it 'cause it never really matter
Knew that I would never go back, don't hold back
Just shine my golden teeth
Just throw my dubs sack, that boof pack
That specimen, I could beef with OG beepers, nigga
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, posted on the corner like a trapper, uh
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper? Uh
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper? Uh
Uh, uh, uh-huh
(testing, testing, testing)
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky &
BlocBoy JB
]
All I ever wanted was some money and some jewels (
Jewels
)
Pray my YouTube reach a hundred million views (
Million
)
Pray I make a little extra cash for my dudes (
Dudes
)
Like all she ever wanted was some ass for her boobs
Sneaking, uh, why she freaky? (
Freaky
) Uh, why she geeking?
Uh, when she see me (
See me
) why she kinky? Uh
Why she wanna be my— (
I don't know why, nigga
)
Twenty years later and God still ain't make no errors (
Make it
)
You could be authentic, it's just living trial and error (
you gotta take it
)
Sitting in the cell, just from snitching on your cello-phone
But cozy beeper all I needed (
Hello
) OG beeper all I needed (
Hello
)
[Outro: A$AP Rocky &
BlocBoy JB
]
My whole life I just wanted to be that nigga (
Nigga
)
All my ex-hoes, they was turning into strippers (
Bitch
)
Then the whole time they was fucking other niggas (
What
)
I paid no mind, I'm like fuck them other niggas
(Fuck 'em)
