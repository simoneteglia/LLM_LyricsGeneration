[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
I get so high, I touch the sky 'til I can't even function
I get so high, I fuck around and wanna leave the function
The only thing that's on my mind is I'm gon' leave with something
But it's nothing, and we roll one, with the Tussionex,
and we gon' get
Get, get, get (Get lit) get lit, lit (Get) lit, lit (Lit)
Get, get, get (Get lit) get lit, lit (Get) lit, lit (Lit)
Get, get, get (Get lit) get lit, lit (Get) lit, lit (Lit)
Get, get, get (Get lit) get lit, lit (Get) lit, lit
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
It's about to go down, drunker than a bitch
Afterparty with my niggas, slumber party with your bitch
Finna hit a lick, 10-56,
takin' sips, let the syrup sit
Let it get to mix, every day, we gettin' gettin' lit
That 'Purrp purp when I get lit,
'methazine, tell 'em sip this
I'm on that Memphis, that 666,
Trip Six shit, bitches
A fifty box of them Swishers,
gold slabs on them sixes
In a backseat full of bitches
tryna hit licks, we gon' get lit
[Chorus]
(
We about to get lit
) Lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
(
We about to get lit
) Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
(
We about to get lit
) Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
(
We about to get lit
) Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
(
We about to get
) Get lit

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Just light the candle on the nightstand sitting by the lotion
I got her open, got her floating off this purple potion
Just take a hit, no time to quit because you gotta smoke this
I gotta focus when I po' it cause it's kinda potent
(
She like them all gold slugs
) No diamonds on it
I chuck the deuce, I'm coming down and I be riding spokes and
I be that pretty motherfucker and you gotta know this, this
Now we gotta go get, get, now we gotta go get
[Chorus]
(
We about to get lit
) Lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit

Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
(
We about to get lit
) Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
(
We about to get lit
) Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
(
We about to get
) Get lit
[Outro: Fat Tony]
Young nigga from the Southside of H-Town
Fat Tony up in this bitch, fuckin' with A$AP Rocky in this bitch
Out in NY, Harlem in this bitch
You know how young niggas connect from state to state
Keeping it great, nigga, puttin' it in ya face, nigga
Five in the morning making this shit happen dawg
(You just happen to be yawning, nigga)
Y'all niggas ain't never understand
(You already understand how I stay, bitch!)
How we stay so throwed in this hoe, nigga
Niggas so throwed like we don’t know no better, nigga
We disobedient, nigga
Mama wanna grab the switch, we like, "Fuck that, nigga"
We out here, mayne, coming down, coming live
