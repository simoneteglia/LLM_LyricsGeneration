[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Step on the scene
With the Co-Comethazine
Give him a magazine clip (Blick, blick, uh)
Wax on, keep it legit like I told you, ten-fold
Green Benjis, Blue Benjamins, identical
I keep me some 20s, no 20s or 10s, can't bend or fold
Keep me some Crippies, all red billies, no menopause
I’m that nigga, bitches on my zipper, walk around like that nigga
Disagree, I beg to differ, I back door strippers
In the back, slap niggas, I even smack childrens
Walk around like Katt Williams
Come for your head, uh, must've been off of your meds, uh
Lockin' them niggas with dreads
Fruity pebbles on my teeth, uh
I got dinner with Fred, tell him my business ahead
Might get him some head
On the stick, riding so much, get him some pegs (Shit)
They ask me if I’d rather be dead or sit in the feds
Nah, I'd rather be rich, fuck bitches instead (Uh, yeah, bitch)
'Cause ain't no hoes inside the prison walls
Just holes inside the prison, pause
Walk around like that nigga with bonafide killas
[Chorus: Comethazine]
I walk around like that nigga, finger on the trigger
If a nigga want some smoke, I let this choppa eat his liver (Boom)
I came with the .38, I'm leavin' with a body
If he try me, do him sloppy, shootin' out the big body (Raah)
I walk around like that nigga, finger on the trigger
If a nigga want some smoke, I let this choppa eat his liver (Boom)
I came with the .38, I'm leavin’ with a body
If he try me, do him sloppy, shootin’ out the big body (Raah)
[Verse 2: Comethazine]
Ayy, pop out on a pussy (Boom), nigga, what the fuck up?
Gas pack strong as fuck, my blunt be doing push-ups (Push-ups)
If you 'bout that action, tell that pussy nigga buck up (Buck up)
You be talkin’ hella tough on Twitter, pull the fuck up (Ayy)
My bust down be shinin' like some glitter, but it's VV (Ayy)
Murk a nigga, put him on the news, he on TV (Ayy)
I got all this ice 'cause I’m a goddamn celebrity (Ayy)
Bust down demon on my motherfuckin' Cuban link
[Chorus: Comethazine]
I walk around like that nigga, finger on the trigger
If a nigga want some smoke, I let this choppa eat his liver (Boom)
I came with the .38, I'm leavin' with a body
If he try me, do him sloppy, shootin' out the big body (Raah)
I walk around like that nigga, finger on the trigger
If a nigga want some smoke, I let this choppa eat his liver (Boom)
I came with the .38, I'm leavin' with a body
If he try me, do him sloppy, shootin' out the big body (Raah)
[Verse 3: Comethazine]
Yeah, now you boys know me, I ball better than Kobe
Keep that .38 on me, fuck boy, so please don't approach me
She got ash up on her knees 'cause I stand up when she blow me
Got my first bag and took a risk, it was a car or the Rollie (Raah)
Bitch, I wanted the Rollie, I took a Uber to buy it
Now my limo tint big body, got a white man to drive it
I was down on my dick, ain't have no money to buy shit
And I walk 'round like that nigga, just in case you forgot, bitch
[Chorus: Comethazine]
I walk around like that nigga, finger on the trigger
If a nigga want some smoke, I let this choppa eat his liver (Boom)
I came with the .38, I'm leavin' with a body
If he try me, do him sloppy, shootin' out the big body (Raah)
I walk around like that nigga, finger on the trigger
If a nigga want some smoke, I let this choppa eat his liver (Boom)
I came with the .38, I'm leavin' with a body
If he try me, do him sloppy, shootin' out the big body (Boom)
