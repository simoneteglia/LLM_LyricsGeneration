[Chorus: Joe Fox]
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
And this love, and this love, and this love gon' own our
[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I think my cup is gettin' muddy, oh buddy
Is this that punch, drunk, and love it, no buggy?
Eyes bloody when we out in public
I'm hubby, she say she love me
Wasted money on syrup and honey, she think she Duffy
Then I became a druggy, enhanced my fame and money
And for your pain and sufferin', my karma's waitin' for me
Expecting payments from me
But she won't get a damn thing from me
She just might get a band-aid from me
You swear the Benz and these bands ain't from me
[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky &
Joe Fox
]
I know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke
The night is still young, for you to sip and whine
(Slow, slow, slow
) Let me see you whine
(
Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah
)
I know your heart is broken (Oh), pick up your wine glass
With your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow
(
Slow, slow, slow
) Let me see you whine
(
Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah
)
[Chorus: Joe Fox]
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes
[Bridge: M.I.A. &

How many fucks am I supposed to give? (

[Verse 2: Future]
You the one that was puttin' up with me (Hey)
You see how these streets corrupted me (Hey)

I know that look that you givin' me (Yeah)
