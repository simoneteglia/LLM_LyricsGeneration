Couple fans in the hood I got no choice but to vent
Going in front to back
At events, fuckin' packed
With the hits back to back
With the gas from the back
Gold on gold, platinum plaques (

To the cathedral, tux like I'm married (Tux on like I'm married)
Don't got a ring on but it feel like I'm married (Ring on my finger)
To the cathedral, tux like I'm married (Like I'm married,
yeah
)
Know when that ring involved, know that it married (
Yeah
)
Fuck views and opinions
I'm willin' to die, seemin' to shake off the image
But when I'm inside pretendin' to smile
I feel the same high from the vengeance (
Check it out
)
I mean, I know we're both grown, like who are we kiddin'?
Goodbye to the correct way
The picket fences, kids in the kitchen
Stuck in this world, I feel lost
I'm feelin' trapped in my thoughts (
Yeah
)
I don't know who to trust (
Yeah
)
Just got my word and my balls (
Yeah
)
This is hell in a hole
I know this the life that we chose
But lovin' the life that we livin' (
Uh
)
We'll make it in the beginnin'
Save me the tux
Save me the tux for the endin' (Save me the tux, save me)
Ending
