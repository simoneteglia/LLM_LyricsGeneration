Please, please
[Chorus: JID]
Get off my dick, get off my dick
Forty my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, rollin' my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this shit
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit
Get off my dick, get off my dick
Forty my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, rollin' my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this shit
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit (Woah)
[Verse 1: JID]
Okay, East Atlanta playboy
Don't got much to say, boy
Cradle to the grave, and it's been like that since a slave, boy
It ain't shit to pull up, pick the fucking tool up
Screaming hallelujah, pushing daisies and some tulips
(Hi guys, hi, hi, hi)
Itty bitty bitch, niggas in the city with it
Pull up with a stick,
thirty with the dick
Seen you in a minute, nigga, put you in cement
Anybody get a nigga, anybody get
Shot to the top, nigga poppin' this shit
Got the drop in your crib, in the spot where you live
If you talking that shit, nigga, stop it
I'm a god, I'm a king, I'm a giant
Nigga not trying, .40 my side
Eastside guy, but I been worldwide
D.I.Y, T.I.Y, I'ma try, I'ma die for what I believe in
We like to feast and I try to eat, cannibal meat
I am not an animal, a beast
Riding with the hammer on the seat (
Oh
)
Shotgun, shotgun, hand on my heat
Badmon, badmon, land of my freedom
Nigga get life, let the white folks be
Online beef, not my motif
.45 me, ta-ta, go sleep
Don't mind little old me, lil' OG
J.I.D, I came in on the boat, see
May I be the cold nigga with the most heat
Niggas know bro, you don't know me
[Chorus: JID &
J. Cole
]
Get off my dick, get off my dick
Forty my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, rollin' my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this shit
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit
Get off my dick, get off my dick
Forty my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, rollin' my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this shit (
Hey
)
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip (
Okay, okay
)
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit (
Okay, okay, okay
)
[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Legend out the 2-6 (Woah)
Y'all know who the truth is (Woah)
Crazy like a movie by that nigga Stanley Kubrick (Woah)
Perfect time to pop up (Woah)
Wet you like the hot tub (Woah)
Clean up Aisle seven, damn, somebody gettin' mopped up (Woah)
Pull up on the block, eeny, meeny, miny, moe
You and every nigga that you know is getting popped
Fuckin' with a nigga, ass sitting in the box
Tryna sneak diss, then I'm pickin' up the Glock
I squeeze this, they be pickin' up the top
Styles, Sheek, Kiss, yeah, I'm pickin' all the locks
Pickin' on a nigga way bigger, then I got
Bigger than the nigga that was
Kindergarten Cop
Terminator
shit, I'm a robot
With the chrome .45 that most don't got
One false move, get your moto shot
Turn a nigga whip to a photo op
Click, click, click, and the flows don't stop
'Til I got more cream than Cold Stone got
Like a boatload, nigga I'ma float on top
'Til the grass don't grow and the wind don't blow
And the po-po don't kill niggas no more
I bought a forty round extendo
If a nigga wanna duck, then I'm playing
Duck Hunt
In real life, not on Nintendo
Looking out the window like Malcolm X with the rifle
Climb the steps up the Eiffel
Barely broke a bead of sweat, woah
Many hope to be the best, oh
Cannot fuck with me just yet, though
JID the closest thing to me
C'est la vie, my vocal range putting
Blood stains on Notre Dame hoodies
Hello fiends, I brought novocaine plus dopamine
You can load your veins with the product I slang
Niggas gon' honor my name, boy, I'm a god in this game
Y'all niggas homonyms, sounding the same
Not in my lane so I can't complain
Me and Ben Frank got a damn good thing goin' on
Way more than a random fling
Cole and JID with a tandem, niggas can't stand 'em
Got a new anthem, look at my whip
Slit on my wrist, suicide, suicide doors on my Phantom
[Chorus: JID &
J. Cole
]
Get off my dick,
get off my dick
Forty my hip, loadin' my clip
Cannabis, cannabis, rollin' my spliff
Hannibal, Hannibal, look what I did
Edible, edible, got the munchies
But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this shit
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit
