[Intro: Ari Lennox]
Ooh
Hold it, need it, need it, yeah
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow
[Verse 1: Ari Lennox]
Touch me, take me, kiss me
Love me, impress me
Pull up, black truck, ganja
Wrist so blinding, heart so timeless
Wishing, you could meet me, see me, freak me
[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox &
J. Cole
]
You lost in the shape of my hips
Hope there is a move
If you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (
Oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Hope there is a move (
Oh, oh, oh, oh
)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can
[Chorus: Ari Lennox &
J. Cole
]
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets
(
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You crossed my mind a thousand times
The cost was fine, I draw the line
I'm back, relapse, I'm fiending
Yes, what's that? In fact, I'm dreaming
Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
I got a shot at you, you wouldn't reach
Cop that, cock back, trigger release
Pop that top, take a sip of your holiest water
I know I'm a part of your flow now
Tell me you cut her
Don't matter you love her or not, you got part of her soul now
I ain't know then, but I know now
Apologies due, to one of the few
The ones I ran through, but never loved you
I pray you found peace and you whole now
I'm doin' better, I got me a chocolate bar
Climbin' on top of the bar
Think of the shape, and I lick in the places you only gon' lick when you rock with her forever
[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox &
J. Cole
]
You lost in the shape of my hips
Hope there is a move
And if you really down, we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (
Oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Hope there is a move (
Oh, oh, oh, oh
)
And if you really down we can find it
Lost in an alley, make love
[Chorus: Ari Lennox &
J. Cole
]
Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)
Shea Butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets
(
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)
