[Refrain]
Do you wanna, do you wanna be?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
[Verse]
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
[Refrain]
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be?
