[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Art of seduction,
hoes jump like Vince Carter
Backstage like they a part of production
We talked about her dreams, you gotta start off with something
Her momma went to college but yet her father was hustling
Found it funny 'cause now they daughter is stuck in
A similar predicament, I'm askin' where her nigga went
She said "Your guess is good as mine
Dropped outta school now he run the streets like all the time
Left me alone with this baby I don't hear from the nigga
And to keep hundred with you I don't care for the nigga
Well, movin' on
Funny 'cause I only know a couple of your songs but I love when they come on"
Word?
[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted

I'm in a small ass town with a superstar chick
This is superstar dick, girl how could you not taste it?
[Verse 2]
That's a little egoâ€”
Tistic, my amigos be hocking in Toledo
Niggas winning off me, it's all G 'cause he know
Bitches can't get the Michael so they settling for Tito
We know, yeah nigga we know
Hot bitch fell in my lap like cappuccino
Niggas so thirsty it irks me
You keep on putting bitches over money but that ain't my cup of tea though
Nah nigga, the game is to get
A bunch of paper just to change your fucking neighbors and shit
I swear if niggas put half of what they put in chasing ass
Into a craft, by now you'd be famous and rich, huh
But I get it, you rather lay with a bitch
While you play with her pussy, and let her play with your dick, huh
She thinking she got a first round pick, huh
She thinking 'bout all the things she can get, huh
She thinking you got a Range for a whip
And a fly ass cribbo, but it's not that simple 'cause
All you got is a phone full of bitches
And they just like her
Meanwhile I'm stacking paper up, my word
Had more hoes coming than a bus driver
Got a full grown woman wanna fuck my word
Wanna ride my nouns, let her suck my verbs
Aye
[Hook]
I'll take it, baby I'll take it
Why I'm starin' at you 'cause I'm picturing you naked
Know what's on your mind, embrace it, do not fake it
Tonight is what you make it, take it, do not waste it
Take a shot, you not wasted
