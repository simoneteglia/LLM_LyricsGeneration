[Part I: "2SEATER"]
[Chorus]
We can speed in my two-seater
Girl, I got a two-seater
Speed in my two-seater
In my two-seater
[Verse 1]
About a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop (Yeah)
You see, my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
But since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
E92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And if I crash, I'm owing wheels like I'm a Vaughn or a Vince,
Tiptronic
is stick
Or automatic, you pick,
shit is static as shit (Yeah)
Sure my shit is AM, might get that X6 end
Don't follow exit him, might take a back street hidden
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on him neck next his precious gems
No AMG, it's M, boy, I will eat him Benz
New engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims
You got a warranty, don't care if you scratching rims again
[Chorus]
We can speed in my two-seater
Girl, I got a two-seater
Speed in my two-seater
In my two-seater
[Bridge]
Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, 'cause you driving me wild
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes, it's too much
And you can feel the beat in my heart
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes, it's too much
[Verse 2]
Yeah
I know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers and shottas
And fucking shoot at your Honda,
then fucking zoom out in Mazdas
Them GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonald's
Boy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas, if you flex, then they swarm
They cashing so many checks, they're calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09
Or probably September...
Boy, I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves,
skate park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again
'Cause I killed the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in (*beep*)
Give it 'til he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue,
like cops are changing fits or shit, I'm killin' it
Fuck!
[Verse 3]
Back when Left Brain had the hightop fade (Fade)
And we would go skate on them concrete waves (Waves)
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted, boy, my board's in the trunk (Skate!)
[Segue]
Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
'Cause it's windy
But I love it when your hair...
[Part II: "HAIR BLOWS"]
[Chorus]
Blows, when it blows
When your hair blows (When it blows)
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows (When it blows)
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
[Verse]
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrrting on these niggas
Skrrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrrting on these niggas
Skrrting on these bitches
[Bridge]
You can say you don't want to take that drive
But your hair, it blows
(It blows me away)
I know we'll have a good time
You just gotta stop being scared
Just roll
Just come and roll with me
It's all good
[Outro]
Yeah, man, what's good, man? You good? I've been—
I've been chilling, man, I've been doing some push-ups and shit
For real?
You know, fifty a day...
Oh, w-w-wait... is that that nigga, Tyler?

Bitch ass, nigga, here he come to me, man
Fuck this nigga, man, this— this nigga stink...
Wait, be quiet, be quiet

So you can go get your shit up, I can get y'all some shit...

Aw thanks, man, I'm trying, man, I'm just trying
Yeah, man, let me know if you need anything
