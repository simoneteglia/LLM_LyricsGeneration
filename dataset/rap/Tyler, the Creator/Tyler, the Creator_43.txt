[Intro: Tyler, The Creator &
DJ Drama
]
Rolls-Royce pull up, Black boy hop out
Shoutout to my mother, and my father didn't— (
Hold up
)
"Oh, my God, I never seen nothin' like this"
Haha, that's what my mom was sayin'
She, she was cryin' and shit
It was, she was just like, "This shit is beautiful"
It was a beautiful moment
You alway– you always keep the picnic blankets in the back
'Cause you, you never know
(
Gangsta Grillz
)
You never know where the fuck you gon' end up at
(
Okay
, haha, let's go,
now we ready
)
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator,
DJ Drama
&
Jasper
]
Rolls-Royce pull up, Black boy hop out
Shoutout to my mother, and my father didn't pull out
MSG sell out, fuck these niggas yap 'bout?
Whips on whips, my ancestors got they backs out (
Yeah, oh
)
Too far? Five hundred stacks for the hood (
I dare you, nigga
)
Call me lumbеrjack 'cause I wish a nigga would race (Uh-huh,
right)
Do it like I? This thе wish-a-nigga-could face (Uh)
They ain't gettin' paper like they should, wait
(
You niggas woulda, coulda, shoulda
,
oh, shit
)
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator,

&
Jasper
]
Niggas ain't really on the type of shit he on
I hit Drizzy and told him I had a milli' for him (
Oh shit
)
I own my companies full, told 'em to keep the loan
I took that gold bitch home, niggas was big mad (Ugh,
oh shit
)
I put that bitch on the shelf to let it ventilate
And bought another car 'cause I ain't know how to celebrate (
Top shelf, nigga
)
That big boy, that big bitch for all weather
It never rain in Cali', came with an umbrella (
Ooh
)
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator,
DJ Drama
&
Jasper
]
Rolls-Royce pull up, Black boy hop out (
Man, what the fuck?
)
Shoutout to my mother, and my father didn't pull out
MSG sell out, fuck these niggas yap 'bout? (
Sold out
)
Good credit score, this card really can't max out (
Wow
)
Too far? Five hundred stacks for the hood
Call me lumberjack 'cause I wish a nigga would race (Uh-huh)
Nigga this the face, man I wish a nigg— (
It's the face)
It's different, it's really different
(
Catch up, niggas
)
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator,

Ayo, I might just sled in Utah, LA is too warm
My nigga tall, he look like a bitch, I call him Mulan (
Hey, oh
)
Salad colored emerald on finger, the size of croutons
Niggas can not fuck with performance of magic (
Oh
), new wand (
Nigga
)
That's my nuance, used to be the weirdo
(
Ah
)
Used to laugh at me, listen to me with their ears closed
Used to treat me like that boy off Malcolm in the Middle  (
Why I'm motherfuckin' rich
)
Now I'm zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero (
That's six
)
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator,
DJ Drama
&
Jasper
]
Rolls-Royce pull up (Zero), Black boy hop out (
That's seven
)
Nah, I can't take this shit no more, man, I quit
That's it
,
I quit, I swear to God, nigga
Fuck niggas talking to me about? Close y'all fuckin' faces
Quality Wednesday music
Wish-a-nigga-could face
(Them stones is cloudy, nigga)
Oh yeah, you asked for it
(Fuckin' crumbs)
Wish-a-nigga-would face
Fuck you mean, nigga?
