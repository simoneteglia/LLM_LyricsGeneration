[Part I]
[Verse 1]
Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor
[Chorus]
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?
[Bridge]
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch
[Verse 2]
Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck
[Chorus]
Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?
[Interlude]
Whoop, uh huh
Yeah, bitch
Yeah
[Part II]
[Intro: slowthai]
I see the light
Now didn't I tell you motherfuckers
Um, I see the light
To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you?
I see the light
That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do
I see the light
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator &
slowthai
]
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (
I see the light
)
Is that shit clear? Check the aperture
Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (
I see the light
)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (
I see the light
)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (
I see the light
)
[Chorus: slowthai]
I see the light
I see the light
I see the light
(
Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though
)
I see the light
(
Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though
)
I see the light
[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator &
slowthai
]
That car crash couldn't take me (
Woo, ha
)
Green haired angels all around me (
Uh
)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (
I see the
)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...
[Outro: slowthai &
Jerrod Carmichael
]
Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (
I said
)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it
