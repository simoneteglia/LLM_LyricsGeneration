[Verse 1]
Hello, I'm a salesman, sorta giant
I sell Molly and Mary and other various items
One time, one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead, tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short, he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding, uh
[Chorus]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high (Tryna get high)
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Task force poured into my fortress (Fortress)
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
, and
Then they found a couple portraits on the porch
Hope they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties, and we was raging, I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches
I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft
,
I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin, cotton, leather, and wool
And most people like flying kites
, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake 'cause it's good,
I mean, I would if I could
But I like playing dress-up and mix-match
Sorry, I'ma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back (Kids back)
[Chorus]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high (Tryna get high)
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high (Tryna get high)
Dope—Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
[Bridge]
What's in my trunk?
White girl
What's in my trunk?
White girl
You need a warrant, officer
[Verse 3]
You could say I kill 'em if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug 'em down
It's pretty disgusting
Finger-crush your face,
I'll leave you permanently blushing
, blood
[Outro]
Nosebleed drugs
Cook you in the oven, yeah
