[Part I: FUCKING YOUNG]
[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana, but I had to pretend that I wasn't
[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, "I don't know"? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because
[Chorus:
Charlie Wilson
&
Tyler, The Creator
]
'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (
For me, uh
)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (
No
)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
A six-year Difference, uh
Is a ten year Sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another Statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love
[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, "I don't know"? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because
[Chorus:
Charlie Wilson
&
Tyler, The Creator
]
'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (Woo!)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God,
yo
)
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
When you're thirty-five, I'll be forty-one
And when I'm twenty-seven, you'll be twenty-one,
yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo, this is dumb,
you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally, you're older than me, and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang", I'm thinking 'bout a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
But I found my wings, fuck
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator &
Charlie Wilson
]
But you're too fucking young
I really like you
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
I don't know what to do
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)
It won't even matter,
I'll be in the clear, haha
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young, ha
[Part II: PERFECT]
[Intro: Kali Uchis]
Boy, I know that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy, I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)
[Verse: Kali Uchis &
Tyler, The Creator
]
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I'll exit and wait a while
Just say the word, girl
Can't you see the answers are all there?
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you, girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all, baby, it's just you and me
[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckinâ€™ hurts
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
I rock (I rock)
I rock (I rock)
I rock (I rock)
