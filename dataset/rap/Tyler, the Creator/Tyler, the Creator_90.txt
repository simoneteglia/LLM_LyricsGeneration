[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not
Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you can bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke, but I'm just asking, baby; could you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel,
well, baby, meet me by the lake
Bathin' suit, it's going down, shit, just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars,
well, could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me
[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I'm give it to her, she want that summer time
I'm give it like no other 'cause she know I'm hers
Damn right, she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right, it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summer time, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga (
Hahaha
)
Catch us Venice beachin', she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club 'cause she like to get it popping
Sangria
on my freedmind, 'cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her, but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in,
when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine,
I am her porcupine
I poke her face
her throat for taste,
give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
I can grab the fireworks, and soda, all the cookies we could eat
Make you nauseous, but be cautious, this is not
Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it,
you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke
, but I'm just asking, baby; could you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel,
well, baby, meet me by the lake
Bathin' suit, it's going down, shit, just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well, could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I packed a couple
sandwiches
inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine
[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, grab a drink
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, look in the sky
Watch the sunset (
Hahaha
), we can watch the sunset, we never have to leave
Watch the sunset (There goes a rainbow,
Hahaha
)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (We can stay here,
hahaha
)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (All night long,
hahaha
)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (
Hahaha
)
Watch the sunset (There goes a rainbow)
Watch the sunset (
Hahaha
), we can watch the sunset (Look)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (
Hahaha
)
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset (
Hahaha
)
Watch the sunset (Let's go to sleep,
hahaha
)
We're here, all night, school is in session
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep
