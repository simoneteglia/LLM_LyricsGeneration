[Intro]
Oh, I don't need the metronome, bro
Ayy
Kahn-da-muh, duh-cay
When you wanna be, ah
When you eat all the cheese
In the store, in the store, in the store
In the store, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
[Chorus]
(It's this girl)
[Verse 1]
She lives next door
To the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply
[Chorus]
(It's this girl)
[Verse 2]
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beatin' Richard up
To mental images—her face look
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook
(This girl)
Video chats are so exciting
'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy (Yeah)
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate (Arg, it's this girl)
I see her in class
Not really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, ah, my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of datin' this bitch
[Chorus]
(It's this girl)
Her name is my password, fuck
[Refrain]
(This girl)
[Verse 3]
All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck are known as bitches and sluts
But she's special
I know, to y'all, I come off as rough; but I'm the nicest to her
And I just want to concur, a relation
I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands, walking home
I look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that I hate, but
[Refrain]
(This girl)
[Verse 4]
Things are looking great; cut, copy
Last time we talked, she said that her relationship was rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Faggot's gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
(Girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in the cut at Wendy's, she's not alone (Fuck)
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her? (Shit)
Come to find out, she got back with her nigga (Damn)
Damn, fuck
[Chorus]
(It's this girl)
Another one, it’s not the first time
(It's this girl)
[Verse 5]
She's so pretty
Fuck self-pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know
What do I do with myself?
Sit in my room for some days?
Play Xbox with piles full of wet socks? Fuck that
(Girl)
[Verse 6]
My nigga ask, "Ace, what happened to such-and-such?"
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked ("Yeah, I fucked")
Or I could tell him the truth, and just say she ain't like me much
But instead, I lie, and say she moved to Nebraska
[Chorus]
(It's this girl)
But she's not mine
