[Part I]
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy
I'm watching
Freaks and Geeks
with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
Nigga
[Pre-Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me, nigga, you not important
I'm focused (
Two, three, four
)
Bring in the horns
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator &
Kanye West
]
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot,
please come and get me
(
Two, three, four
)
Said I suckin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy, I'm sicky
(
Two, three, four
)
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon (Yeah)
And a terrorist? Goddamn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
(
Two, three, four
)
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigâ€‹ger
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (Man...)
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
(
Two, three, four
)
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust (Woo)
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beast is loose
(
Two, three, four
)
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
(
Why, oh, why don't they like me? They don't like me, oh
)
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more Section 8
And what we ate was the steaks, now our section is great
(
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, don't they like me?
)
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my nigga, pass 'em a plate
'Ye!
[Pre-Verse: Kanye West]
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me?
(
Two, three, four
)
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
(
Two, three, four
)
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike
[Verse 2: Kanye West &
Tyler, The Creator
]
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
(
Two, three, four
)
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
(
Two, three, four
)
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (Yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
(
Two, three, four
)
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em (
Two, three, four
)
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?"
(
Two, three, four
)
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
(
Two, three, four
)
I know they told they white daughters, "Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype (Woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon (Ask the deacon)
It's funny, when you get extra money (
Two, three, four
)
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (Yeah, yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
(
Two, three, four
)
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
(Woo) (
Two, three, four
)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (
Skrrt!
)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level
(
Two, three, four
)
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God
(
Two, three, four
)
He said, "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard", uh (Woo)
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin'
Freak and Geeks
, got a trampoline in my room
Damn
(
Two, three, four
)
[Part II]
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator &
Lil Wayne
,
both
]
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction
Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoney's,
yeah
It's Tunechi, homie, Master of Ceremonies
I knock 'em down, Domino effect, no pepperoni, I swear
It's them Golf boys, like them Hot Boys (Yeah)
For the nine-nine and two-thousand,
but it's the two-thou' and (
Yeah
)
The one-four and the one-five,
yo, what up, Wayne?
What up, Slime? Nigga, go hard
Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad, and she give brain
That's that road head (
Ye
ah
), that's a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that one-nine-nine-one,
'nother nigga like I, you won't find one
'Cause, nigga, I'm a god, a divine one; Tune!
(
Two, three, four
)
My trigger finger wise, but my .9 dumb
(Yeah)
Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one
(Um)
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rollie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda, oh my goodness
Wayne, them bitches ugly,
these niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel
(Black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling (
Two, three, four
)
Boy, let's get a scrimmage and cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German,
you bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow and get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot, ugh!
Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus
(That's too harsh)
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini
I know,
it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or l
ame, nor strange,
nah, faggot, it's Golf Wang
