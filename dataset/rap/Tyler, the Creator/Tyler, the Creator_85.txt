[Intro: Tyler, The Creator,

Fuck you niggas talkin' to me about?
See, see, as a kid, I felt alienated by the niggas who looked just like me
Niggas treated my nuance like it, like it was a nuisance
So, so I was like, I was like, "Fuck 'em"
Fuck 'em, I did my own shit, and now I'm up and now all that paid off
And all them niggas, they peaked in high school
I always had confidence, I ain't never been nervous, I ain't never had anxiety, I ain't never second-guessed myself
If I want it, I go get it
I'm always on go mode, I just go
I don't know what fear is
When they talk about, "That nigga," I'm him, I'm him, I'm that nigga
(
Run
)
It's funny, right?
(
Run
)
For some reason, y'all didn't really think we was gon' be here
(
Run
)
See, for y'all, the sky is the limit
For us, the sky is just what we stand on to
reach the beyond
(
Run, run, run
)
High above the clouds, as you see us (
Gangsta
)
Catch up, niggas

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator &

]
He off the dope (Yeah)
We off it, we off the boat (Okay, true story,
run
)
Crosshairs 'til he off, we tee off like G-olf
We (Phew-phew-phew), we see off the scope
So I (Run), grin (Run)
Bunnyhop been zoomed in
Ever since I hit two tens
Of the faces with the blue skin
With the green background, don't know how to act now (
Now
)
But I need unagi on my bluefin (Yeah)
Fiends moonwalk when I come (Hold up)
Deaf hoes speak when I'm here
The dead hit sprints when I hum
Why you actin' so dumb?
Bitch, you know I got the fuzz (
Now
)
I'm live from the 310
Green Goblin, it bend tires (Ah)
No lots, they send photos, I send wires
Gumballs cool me down, I'm on fire
Can't fuck with him (
Yeah
)
Rap (Rap music, nigga)
Helped us see clear when the lightin' was dim, dim
We
Ain't nothin' to you, but we somethin' to them, them
When you in your room and you starin' at the ceilin'
Dreamin', I want you to know it's no ceilings
I want you to notice that feelin'
I want you to leap and go for it (Yeah)
I want you to reach with no fearing
Throat clearing, scream it, let 'em hear it
Run that shit up, baby (Yeah)

We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up (
Let's go up, baby

We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
Here today but gone tomorrow

I just might spend it all

I just might spend it all

We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
We gon' run it up
I'm runnin' like a politician (I'm runnin' like, runnin' like)
I'm runnin' like the water on the dirty dishes
(I'm runnin' like)
I'm runnin' like the roaches in the kitchen
I'm runnin' like the damn transmission
(I'm runnin' like, I'm runnin' like)
I'm runnin' like I'm not tryna catch a whippin
' (I'm runnin' like, runnin' like)
I told you, nah, I told you (I'm runnin' like, runnin' like, I'm runnin' like, runnin' like, I'm runnin' like)
We gon' run it up
