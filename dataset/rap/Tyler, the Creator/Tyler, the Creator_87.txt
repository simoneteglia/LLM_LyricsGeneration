[Intro: DJ Drama &
Louisa Whitman

"Mom, get 'em," shut yo' ass up
Dedicated to the haters, the non-believers, and the disgruntled
Oh, no, I don't want you to leave
I want you to stay right here and watch Tyler rise to the top
It feels better that way
[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator &
DJ Drama
]
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay (
Watch what comes next
)
Please don't go yet, plеase just stay
Please don't go yеt, please just stay
Please don't go yet, please just stay
Please don't go yet (
You know my style
)

When I rise to the top

When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now
As crazy as I sound
Oh,

You might as well just get comfortable
)
That's it
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator &
DAISY WORLD
]
Niggas want they merit (Yeah)
Missing cash flow, so they want some credit (Ah, yeah)
Ah-ha nigga, you should be embarrassed (Yeah)
You ain't the only nigga that be in Paris (Ah, yeah)
This shit dead, no need for
paramedics
(Nah)
You ain't where you at in your head, shit is apparent (Oh, yeah)
You ain't head nigga 'round here, you ain't the sheriff (Word)
You ain't seeing shit how it is, get him some carrots
Let me say this shit right here so niggas hear it (
Ah
)
Everything involved in your life is fuckin' pathetic (
Ah
)
Tyler got the talent, Tyler got the vision (Oh)
Tyler that nigga, so really you can't compare us
Why you fill with terror whenever you in my presence? (Why?)
Is it 'cause we look just alike and niggas said it? (Why?)
I will never lose any sleep, I'll never sweat it
And I'll always be ahead of you, nigga, don't you forget it
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator
with DAISY WORLD
&
DAISY WORLD

When I rise to the top

Tellin' you right now
As crazy as I sound

[Bridge: DAISY WORLD &
Tyler, The Creator
]
With the rockets in my mind, yeah
I could touch the sky, I don't see any ceilings (Right now)
And if I fall, there's always tomorrow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (
Yo
)
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator &
DAISY WORLD
]
Let me show you punk motherfuckers what eye know (Yeah)
See, I know, I'm the guy that took a chance like Chicago (Yeah)
So I wind, I can do this shit with my eyes closed
Can't tell the difference like Michael's vitiligo, yeah
There he go again (Woo)
They tried to boycott him, but he didn't dim (Oh, yeah)
He started from the bottom and they want the fall-off
Like he skipped autumn and spring some more wins
Look, you tell me I can't, I tell you I can (
Da-da, da-da, da-da
)
You tell me I can't, I do it again
Reversin' the job, like blowin' a fan
(
Da-da, da-da, da-da
)
No matter which way you look at it
Understand, it's plugged in
You tell me it's nine lives, I'm pushin' it up, ten
You tell me to do five, I'm pushin' a buck ten
I might just cut off the brakes and aim for the sidelines (Ahhh)
For you nothin'-ass niggas and screamin' out "Fuck him," fuck them
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator,
DJ Drama
&
DAISY WORLD
]
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now (
It's gon' hurt watchin' the chart
)
I'm tellin' you right now
Oh, I'll show you something (
It's gonna be a little
painful
for ya
)
When I rise to the top
I'm tellin' you right now (
You gotta love it
)
As crazy as I sound
Oh, I'll show you something (
Ba-buh-buh-duh-daiya
)
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator &
DJ Drama
]
So, so, so, so
(
I'm talking about the tippy-tippy-top
)
(
Your ladder will never allow you to get to these heights
)
Please don't go, please just stay
Please don't go, please just stay (I can't fuck with me)
Please don't go, please just stay (None of y'all can fuck with me)
Please don't go yet, please just stay (None of y'all niggas can fuck with me)
Please don't go yet, please just stay
Please don't go yet, please just stay (Y'all can't fuck with T, baby)
Please don't go yet (I'm right here)
