[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ladies and gentlemen
We just landed in Geneva
Yeah, that's in Switzerland
We on a yacht
A young lady just fed me French vanilla ice cream
We all got our toes out, too
Call me when you get lost
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator &
DJ Drama
]
I'ma travel the globe,
you keep the block hot
Driver, open the door for me, my hand hurt
Find us, we playin' hide-and-seek with the passports
Where the fuck we at? Oh, the pilot gotta remind us, yeah
The luggage is pilin', I needed clothes to wear (Woo)
So many stinkies sit in my wallet, look like a folding chair (Yeah)
The Cartier so light on my body, thought I floated here
We boated here, it's Tunechi and Tyler, but call me Baudelaire, yeah
Out in Switzerland, travel with my bitch again, we kissin', dawg
I love when she let me rub her like Michelin (Skrrt, skrrt,
facts
)
A hundred grand to sleep on the bird, the wings are whistlin' likeâ€”
Man, they ain't listenin'
We crossed the line like immigrants and benefit from it
Keep on stuntin' on these niggas, make 'em sick to they stomach, man (
I can't stop it
)
Y'all don't understand, fish so fresh that you could taste the sand
Yeah, we gettin' lost but we know who we am (
True story
)
Bada-bada-bada, somethin'-somethin'-somethin'
Treat that last part like you niggas ain't sayin' nothin'
[Break: DJ Drama,
Tyler, The Creator
&
Lil Wayne
]
(
Hot wind
)
Yeah, haha
You see these excursions right here?
Just too lavish to post on the 'Gram (Gangsta Grillz)
Uh
(Tunechi)
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Excuse me, pardon me, the wind, it blow so hard at me
Like mother nature arguing about some baby father beef
And I'm stuck in the middle of the sandwich like slaughter meat
Got my middle fingers to the cameras that's recording me
From y'all to me, brrt, stop callin' me unless you're ordering
I'm on the beach, I got my feet out, and I stay on my feet
The corner beat, I'm on a deep route, just throw the ball to me
Thought all this lean would have me senile, I guess they see now
Let's touch down, catch a beat-down like I catch touchdowns
I fuck 'round and slow the beat down and take the drums out
And speed up my flow, I'm so greedy, I'ma eat my own flow
And I'm in need of a flow, might eat me a rapper and I might as well eat me a ho (Oh)
I'm hot as hell when the weather is freezin', as cold as the devil and demon and ghost
I'ma get even and even, get even some more, it's too late to even get low, baow
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang, that's what I need you to know, Mula, Weezy the G.O.A.T
.
The wind beneath my wings, Desert Eagle underneath my coat
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mula (Bitch)
[Outro: DJ Drama]
(
Hot wind
)
(All aboard, nigga)
You see
We just over here admirin' the view of the mountains from the lake
Of course
Y'all know it's Wolf Haley, man, stop fuckin' playin'
