[Part 1: VCR]
[Intro]
Yeah, haha
[Verse 1]
I don't want to play you
I just want to tape you undressing
And I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore
If it's horror, pop the popcorn
The thoughts to rape you really turns me on
[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Just to press buttons
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch
[Verse 2]
You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die-hard fans can't stop with the tapings
Sort of like a psycho when I can't stop with the rapings
Of the VHS, especially during sex, baby
[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch
[Verse 3]
Ready to watch? I'ma slip it in the tape deck
But put it in slow-mo, I don't want to bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening
Your dream movie? I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
'Cause I'll kill you if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch
[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
(O.F.)
Bitch
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press, please
Stop!
[Part 2: Wheels]
[Verse 1]
Danielle, Danielle
,
yeah you heard about Raquel
Well that didn't go well
, let us try to make it swell
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key
[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you? (I want you bad)
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um
[Verse 2]
We can kick it on the couch,
blunt
you can roll it up
But I'm on some shrooms if you really want to feel the room
I just want to kick it, kick it for the rest
I skated all day, I just need some rest and your breasts
[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um
[Verse 3]
We can count the stars on the hood of your father's car
He's a buster anyway, I can take him any day
Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a kiss? Kiss
[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you? (Bitch)
I want to feel you near (Yeah, got you, bitch)
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um
[Verse 4]
We both teenagers with the same mind state
How about some
ice cream
and some
South Park
for this first date?
Your cat is waiting for that raw fish, I can't wait
Get it?
[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um
