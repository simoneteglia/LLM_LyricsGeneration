Give a fuck about your thoughts, call me if you get lost, bitch

Call me if you get lost, suckers (Hahaha)
We didn't come to play wit' you niggas
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator &
DJ Drama
]
Look, tried to take somebody bitch 'cause I'm a bad person
I don't regret shit because that **** worth it
In the end, she picked him, I hope when they fuckin'
She still thinkin' of me 'cause I'm that perfect
I'ma get that deep text when this verse surface
Better send it to my ego 'cause that shit hurtin'
Hope y'all shit workin' (True story), I'm a psycho, huh?
Don't give a fuck, you left my heart twerkin'
Movin', losin', grip on my doings (Yeah)
Eyes is cryin' on the jet cruisin' (Phew-phew-phew)
'Bout to spend millions just to fill voids up
Drama, I need you (
Yessir
), can you turn the noise up?
Can you turn the noise up? Can you turn the noise up? (
Go, go, go, go
)
Turn the fuckin' noise up, ah, nigga, my heart broken
Remembered I was rich, so I bought me some new emotions
And a new boat 'cause I'd rather cry in the ocean
It's T, baby, uh
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator &
DJ Drama

Hahahaha, I tried to tell y'all
I don't even like using the word "bitch"
It just sounded cool
