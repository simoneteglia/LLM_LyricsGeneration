[Intro]
Random disclaimer!
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?
It's fucking fiction
If anything happens, don't fucking blame me
White America,
fuck Bill O'Reilly
Four, three, two, one
[Verse 1]
What the fuck I look like? Sayin' I'm sorry
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fucking wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash' black hoodies, try something
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring
[Pre-Chorus]
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
[Post-Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Fuck cops, I'm a fucking rockstar
Rebel and defiance makes my motherfucking cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, all some fucking retards
Fuck school, I'm a fuck up?
Fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fucking money (Hey, mom)
I ain't got no motherfucking daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come, that faggot still ain't bought me anything
[Pre-Chorus]
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
[Chorus]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
[Post-Chorus 2]

They want us to go to they schools and (Left, right, left, right, left, right)
Be fucking miserable at they fucking college, studying that bullshit (Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right)

Fuck your traditions (and), fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion (and), fuck your decisions
(See) They're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions (and), fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion (and), fuck your decisions
(See) They're not mine, you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
Fuck your traditions (and), fuck your positions (and)
Fuck your religion (and), fuck your decisions
(See) They're not mine, so you gotta let 'em go
See, we can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know

You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em—
Go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em— (You gotta)

[Outro: Dr. TC &

You gotta let these shits go, man. (You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go)
It's not making sense to you right now, but (You gotta let 'em, go, let 'em go), all these little dreams you got, they're not shit. (Let 'em go, you gotta let 'em, go)
All this rebellion (You gotta let 'em go), all this crazy shit you got, saying this shit (Let 'em go, you gotta let 'em, go), getting too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it. (You gotta let 'e, go)
Growing up, your dreams are getting bigger. (Let 'em go, you gotta let 'em, go)
You gotta look at reality, understand that shit, so you don't get caught. (You gotta let 'em go)
I'm just bein' real (Let 'em go)
Nigga, fuck you (You gotta let 'em—)
I'm just trying to help you, man (You gotta let 'em go), trust me (Let 'em go, you gotta let 'em, go)
Look, I mature day after day, nigga (For real), you don't know shit (You gotta let 'em go), you're a fucking therapist
Whatever (Let 'em go, you gotta let 'em—)
