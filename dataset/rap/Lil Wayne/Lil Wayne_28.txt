[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these niggas
I'ma spare everything but these niggas
I flip the gun and gun-butt these niggas
Take the knife off the AK and cut these niggas (
Kane is in the buildin', nigga
)
Yeah, and fuck these bitches
I swear, I care about everything but these bitches
I don't care, I "so what" these bitches
And I put Young Mula, baby, way above these bitches
If it ain't broke, don't break it
And if he ain't shook, I'm gon' shake him
Hope I don’t look weak, 'cause when a wolf cry wolf
You still see that wolf teeth, mothafucka
Futuristic handgun
If you act foul, you get two shots and one
, haha
I'm at your face like Lancôme, haha
You niggas softer than Roseanne's son, heh
You cannot reach me on my Samsung
I'm busy fuckin' the world and givin' the universe my damn tongue
Crazy mothafucka, I am one
But the crazy thing is, I began one
All-white bricks
I’m straight like it’s jumping back to 36, nigga
Big house, long hallways
Got 10 bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don't want no problems
Okay, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh
Now, pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
What the fuck is up? (Up) It’s Gucci Mane the G (S'Gucci)
Ask Tity Boi, no pity, boy; this scar city, the city boy (What?)
So Icy; so, no Nike, boy, just Gucci, Louis, Prada, 'scuse me ('Scuse me)
"Gucci Mane keep shittin' on me, why that boy keep buying jewelry?" (
Kane is in the buildin', nigga
)
East Atlanta cockin' hammers, bandannas on car antennas (Ugh)
No, we do not talk to strangers, just cut off these niggas' fingers (Huh)
Gucci's armed and dangerous, cocaine, codeine and angel dust
This AK-47 will hit ya anywhere from the ankle up (Ankle)
Gun same size as Nia Long, clip long as a Pringles can (Damn)
4-5 Desert Eagle on me, you'll think I'm a Eagles fan (Huh)
Toni Braxton sniper rifle, make you never breathe again (Hah)
Fuck that nigga, kill that nigga, bring him back, kill him again (Gucci)
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the-the-the money is the motive
Fuck with the money, it get ugly as Coyote
"Okay, I’m reloaded," better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down, and put it in a stogie
Swagger so bright, I don’t even need light
I’m with a model broad, she don’t even eat rice, ha
But, would you believe it? She eat dykes
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her three strikes, yeah
I-I’m the man around this mothafucka
I’m so hot, you probably catch a tan around this mothafucka
This rap game, I got my hand around this mothafucka
Yeah, I said "game," but I ain’t playin' around this mothafucka
Yeah! I’m the best to ever do it, bitch, haha
And you’re the best at never doin' shit
If you the shit, then I'm sewerage
Try me and I'll have your people reading eulogies, haha
I swear, you can't fuck with me
But I can fuck your girl, and make her nut for me, then slut for me
Then kill for me, then steal for me, and of course, it'll be your cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to your ass
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh
Now, pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, man, suck my clip
Swallow my bullets, and don’t you spit, ughhhh
I am the hip-hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I’m all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this? I will make the most of this
"F" is for ferocious, murder your associates
The top is so appropriate, this is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for your girlfriend to wobble on, Weez'
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don't want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh
Now, pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
(
Kane is in the buildin', nigga
)
And we don’t want no problems
Okay, you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, ooh
Now, pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
