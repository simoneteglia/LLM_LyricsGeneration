[Verse 1]
Had no connection, no faith or direction, no
Searching and searching for someone to save my soul (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh, then I heard you say my name
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[Chorus]
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
[Verse 2]
I was so broken, my heart was an empty space
Life was a joke 'til the moment I saw your face
Saw your face, saw your face
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I was swept up in a wavе, swept up in a wave
Ooh, then I hеard you say my name
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[Chorus]
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, again (Again)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, again, yeah (Again)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, again (Again)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, again, yeah (Again)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh, I was fadin' when you came
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (Now I'm found, found, found)
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found (Oh yeah)
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (Now I'm found, found, found)
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
