[Verse 1]
I'll be your sun and your moon tonight
I can be whatever you like, ooh
I was alone but I'm ready to feel
I wanna show you my feelings are real, yeah
All this time I've been living it up
And every night I'd be falling in love, ooh
But I'm finally seeing the light
Falling in love with you every night, yeah
[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now?
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?
[Verse 2]
What the fuck? I got nothing to lose
I'm a slave to the way that you move, ooh
I'm an addict for all that you do
You're the only drug I wanna do, yeah
I can tell that you're needing my love
And all I want is to give it to ya, ooh
And don't give up on the moment tonight
You'll regret it the rest of your life, yeah
[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now?
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?
[Bridge]
I still don't get it, 'cause if you don't know it yet
You'll know that I'm not your enemy, your enemy, yeah
'Cause I know I lie, and it wouldn't kill you trying
Won't go until you've forgiven me, forgiven me
'Til you forgiven me, forgiven me, forgiven me
[Chorus]
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me now?
But if I ever let you down, if I ever let you down
Forgive me, forgive me now
Would it kill you to forgive me?
This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love
Would it kill you to forgive me?
