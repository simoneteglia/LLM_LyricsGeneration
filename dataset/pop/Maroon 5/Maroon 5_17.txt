[Intro: Adam Levine]
Oh, na
Oh
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
Then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now, I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
And it goes like this (Uh)
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard
When you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car
We can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it
And you wanna steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Adam Levine &
Christina Aguilera
]
And it goes like this (Uh)
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Woo, uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah, uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
I've got them moves like Jagger
[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Uh, you wanna know
How to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night (Ah)
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it (Shh)
Nobody else can see this (Ah, uh)
So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby,
rub me right
, yeah
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
[Chorus: Adam Levine &
Christina Aguilera
]
And it goes like this (Uh)
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (
Take me by the tongue
, uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show (
Yeah, yeah
)
You want them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (
Oh yeah
; Woo, uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Yeah, uh;
Ooh
)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you (Oh-oh)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
