[Chorus: Adam Levine]
One light, one light, one light
It's a damn dark world
But there's one light, one light, one light
Long as I'm with you, then it's alright
It used to feel like life was an endless midnight
But now I got one light
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Here's to the brokenhearted, yeah
Don't even get me started, yeah
Ain't nobody want to live in this world today (Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy)
Gotta make it through and do what ever it take
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
What do I tell my daughters?
How do they get through all this? Ooh
How do I help my brother?
How do I save my mama? Ooh
Yeah, when thе world go crazy
Baby, you always save me
And I don't care what you gon' say
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Causе I got one light, one light, one light
It's a damn dark world
But there's one light, one light, one light
Long as I'm with you, then it's alright
It used to feel like life was an endless midnight
But now I got one light
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Baby, we need to be honest, yeah
This is a place that we wanted, yeah
Ain't nobody want to live in this world today (Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy)
Gotta make it through and do what ever it take (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]

[Verse 3: Bantu]
Ooh-wee (Ooh-wee)
I remember back in the day, I was down, you were there for me
Ooh-wee (Ooh-wee)

Back in the summer (Yeah), when we were younger (Yeah)
Girl, what's your number? Oh, yeah
You know I want you (Woah), bamba to bamba (Oh)
