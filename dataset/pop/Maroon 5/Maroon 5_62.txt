[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
You lit the neon inside of my chest
There was no vacancy
I felt the flick of the light that she left
You left a space in me
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Novocaine
I thought I couldn't feel no pain
But it still feels like, ooh, when I hear your name
I can't escape, tryin' but I can't escape
(Let me go)
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You flipped the beat 'round inside of my chest
Changin' the frequency
You had me trippin' the night that you left
Lost electricity
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Novocaine
Thought I couldn't feel no pain
But it still feels like, ooh, when I hear your name
I can't escape, tryin' but I can't escape
(Let me go)
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
[Verse 3: blackbear]
Yeah, I got this heart-shaped hole inside of me
I try to fill with anything
Like taking trips and buying things
Burn bridges that once guided me
And I hate the way I watched you leave
My ego got the best of me
I gave you insecurities, these tears fall on my Bentley seats
And now all I feel is depressed, all that I taste is regret
I cannot tell what is real, only the pain that I feel
You give me nothing but stress and this echo (Echo, echo, echo)
You left in my chest
[Chorus: Adam Levine & blackbear]
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
