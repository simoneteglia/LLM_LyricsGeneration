[Verse 1]
Baby, it's not alright
The second that you turn your back, she'll be outta sight
Baby, she'll break your heart
The second that you spend the night apart-art
[Pre-Chorus]
How could you do it?
Oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made?
How could you do it?
Oh, you better watch yourself, I think that girl's insane
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
[Verse 2]
Baby, she'll eat you alive
As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive
Before she makes you her latest slaughter
[Pre-Chorus]
How could you do it?
Oh, just come back to me
Baby, I'm begging, please
How could you do it?
Oh, she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
