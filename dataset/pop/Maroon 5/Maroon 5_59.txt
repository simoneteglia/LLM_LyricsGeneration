[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like, "Oh, oh, oh," can't take it anymore
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, "Oh, oh, oh," it isn't funny anymore
[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, you never need to know
I don't wanna be picking up all of these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart, won't do it anymore
[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
I was the...
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
[Bridge]
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard?
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming
[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday (I was the man)
I was the man who never lied (Oh, I was the man)
Never lied until today (Oh-oh)
But I just couldn't break your heart (Oh-oh)
Like you did mine yesterday (Oh, yeah)
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh (Oh, I was the man)
(I was the man) I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh (I was the man)
[Outro]
Whoa, yeah
