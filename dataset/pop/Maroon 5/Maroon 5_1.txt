[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Spent twenty-four hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you
Run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I
come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
Girls like you
Love fun, and yeah, me, too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
I spent last night on the last flight to you (Ayy, uh)
Took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
We spent the daylight tryna make things right between us (Oh, oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
And now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close (Yeah)
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you
Run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
Girls like you
Love fun, and yeah, me, too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
(Girls like you)
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
(Oh, girls like you)
I need a girl like you
[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's six forty-five, maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk, maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive (Oh)
[Verse 3: Cardi B]
Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (Eeoow)
Know it's really real if I let you meet my mama (Eeoow)
You don't want a girl like me, I'm too crazy
But every other girl you meet is fugazi (Okurrrt)
I'm sure them other girls were nice enough
But you need someone to spice it up
So who you gonna call? Cardi, Cardi
Come and rev it up like a Harley, Harley
Why is the best fruit always forbidden? (Huh?)
I'm coming to you now doin' twenty over the limit (Wooh)
The red light, red light stop, stop (Skrrt)
I don't play when it comes to my heart, let's get it, though
I don't really want a white horse and a carriage (Carriage)
I'm thinkin' more of white Porsches and carats
I need you right here 'cause every time you're far
I play with this kitty like you play wit' your guitar, ah
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
'Cause girls like you (Girls like you)
Run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah (Oh)
Girls like you (Girls like you)
Love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah (Like you)
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you
