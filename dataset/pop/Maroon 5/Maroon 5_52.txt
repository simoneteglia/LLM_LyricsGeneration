[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes, off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation, hit the road
[Pre-Chorus]
Car overheats, jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long, your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh, no
[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no, they can't
[Verse 2]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around, there you are
[Pre-Chorus]
Cool these engines, calm these jets
I ask you, "How hot can it get?"
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly, you say, "I'm not there yet"
[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no, they can't
[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
