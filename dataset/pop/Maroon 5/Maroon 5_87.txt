[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm
[Verse 1]
I am so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
I wanna spend my life with you
The same thing's, baby
Since we've been together, mmm
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
Baby, baby
I'll never be untrue, baby
Ooh, baby
Let's, ought to stay together (baby)
[Chorus]
Loving you, whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on
[Break]
Oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Whether times are good are bad, happy or sad
Come on
Why, somebody, why people break up? Oh
Turn around and make up
I just can't see
'Cause you'd never do that to me, baby
Would you, baby?
Being around you is all I see, yeah
Ooh baby, let's, we ought to stay together
[Chorus]
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on
[Verse 3]
Let's babe, ought to stay together, baby
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on
Good or bad, happy or sad
Come on, good or bad
Happy or sad
[Outro]
Oh, oh
