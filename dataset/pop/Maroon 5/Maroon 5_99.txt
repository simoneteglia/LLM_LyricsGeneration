[Verse 1]
From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same
Like the taste of the day you left
That still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
A stain where you had wept
All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead
[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
[Verse 2]
Three more days 'til I see your face
I’m afraid it’s far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up
If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You’re my reason for living
And there’s no way I’m giving up, oh
[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
[Bridge]
Now every evening is a bitter fight
And I’m eating home alone on a Friday night
I know what your friends say
"He's just wasting your love and time"
I will never let you change your mind
[Chorus]
No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
No need to cry about it
I may just die without it
Every time I wind up back at your door
Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door
[Outro]
Every time I wind up back at your door
Every time I wind up back at your door
