[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
[Verse 1: YG]
Tequila drinkin', double shot, yeah, I need you
I know this life it look nicе but it get deeper
I run from reapеrs, dodge bullets from Glock, Ninas
I live my life tryna prove myself to non-believers, gotta stop that
The devil talkin', I block that
Got some homies in Heaven now, they watch my back
For all this pain, we numb it with champagne
Hunnid bottles in the club, that's a goddamn shame
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine &
YG
]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy (
4Hunnid
)
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
I done lost love, lost fifties, lost dubs
Lost fights, nigga, lost life of loved ones
Lost time, pressin' rewind, it won't budge
It's alright, you can tell me your truth, I won't judge
I done lost too, relationships you could call true
You hit me up and I'm gon' fall through
Tellin' lies to sound true, like it's all you
Learn to love what's imperfect, that's what God do
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Here's to the ones that we got (Oh-oh)
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through (No, no)
Toast to the ones here today (Ayy)
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories (Ayy)
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ooh, yeah)
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
[Outro: Adam Levine]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
Memories bring back, memories bring back you
