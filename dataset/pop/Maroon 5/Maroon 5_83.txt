[Verse 1]
Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home, babe, 'til you come home
Now you taste best, the poison I've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone, baby, I'm all alone
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh baby, oh
Give a little more, ooh baby, oh
[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh
Get a little more from you, baby, ooh
[Verse 2]
Now, you were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change (If it'll ever change)
And then I give a little more, ooh baby, oh
Give a little more, ooh baby, oh
[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh
Get a little more from you, baby, ooh
[Bridge]
I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end (Gonna get me in the end)
And I cannot pretend
I never wanna feel this way again, oh
[Chorus]
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love (Not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh (Get a little more)
Get a little more from you, baby, ooh (Get a little more)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love (Not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh (Get a little more)
Get a little more from you, baby (Get a little more)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
