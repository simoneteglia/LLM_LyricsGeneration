[Verse 1]
If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me; I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending, kinda run around
[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better
[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me
Un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing
A brand new start
[Verse 2]
Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it that you're over us
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces, because you're over us, ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better
[Chorus]
Un-kiss me, un-touch me
Un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing
A brand new start
[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me
So, un-kiss me
Yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
So, baby, let go, gotta let go
It's disrespectful, I can't handle this
Never ending, kinda run around
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Un-kiss me (Un-kiss me) Un-touch me (Oh)
Un-take this heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I'm missing (I'm missing) Just one thing
A brand new start (Yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
So, un-kiss me (Oh, oh, oh-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh, oh)
So, un-kiss me (Oh, oh, oh-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh, oh)
Un-kiss me
