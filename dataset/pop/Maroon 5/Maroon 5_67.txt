[Verse 1]
Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I had so much time to sit and think about myself
And then there she was like double cherry pie
Yeah, there she was like disco superfly
[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair?
Who's that casting devious stare in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
[Verse 2]
Hangin' 'round downtown by myself
And I had too much caffeine
And I was thinkin' 'bout myself
And then there she was wearin that platform double suede
Yeah, there she was like disco lemonade
[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair?
Who's that casting devious stare in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
[Chorus]
I smell sex and candy here
Who's that lounging in my chair?
Who's that casting devious stare in my direction?
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
Mama, this surely is a dream, yeah
