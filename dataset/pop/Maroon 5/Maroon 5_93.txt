[Intro]
Ooh (Ah, la la la la la la la)
Ooh (Ah, la la la la la la la)
[Verse 1]
I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road (Ooh)
[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
[Verse 2]
I never did my best to express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
And my world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road (Oh yeah)
[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
[Post-Chorus]
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Yeah
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Yeah yeah
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Oh
(Ah, la la la la) Yeah, oh
[Bridge]
My world just feels so cold
And I find myself
Thinking about the things I could have done
And it warms my soul
When you let me know
I'm not the only one
[Chorus]
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
