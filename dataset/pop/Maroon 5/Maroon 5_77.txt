[Intro: Adam Levine]
Ooh, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
Ooh, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Blame it on your mom and dad, live young, die fast
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything
Too much on my mind, another pill and I'll be fine, yeah
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything
[Refrain: Adam Levine]
Sometimes, I feel out of my mind, but I'm not
Feels more like I'm out of my body
Sometimes, I'm in my own way, but I'm not
I don't really feel like anybody
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Stevie Nicks]
Walkin' in the sun, sun-kissеd face
Like candles in thе sun, I'm breakin' down
Take me now, I'm breakin' down
Just need someone to love me, to love me
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Stevie Nicks,
Adam Levine
]
Ooh
, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
Ooh
, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Memories I can't relive, ran away from how I feel
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything
Give no fucks, I never did, livin' like I never lived
That's the remedy, that's the remedy for everything
[Refrain: Adam Levine]
Sometimes, I feel out of my mind, but I'm not
Feels more like I'm out of my body
Sometimes, I'm in my own way, but I'm not
I don't really feel like anybody
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Stevie Nicks]
Walkin' in the sun, sun-kissed face
Like candles in the sun, I'm breakin' down
Take me now, I'm breakin' down
Just need someone to love me, to love me
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Stevie Nicks,
Adam Levine
]
Ooh
, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
Ooh
, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart (
Just a little love
)
Ooh
, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
Ooh
, take it from the start
Just a little love will tear us apart
