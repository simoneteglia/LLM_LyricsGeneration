[Intro]
I really, I really (Whoa)
I really need to know
I really, I really (Whoa)
Or else, you gotta let me go, oh
I really, I really
[Verse 1]
This time I really need to do things right
Shivers that you give me keep me freezing all night
You make me shudder, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinking about no one else
You make me shudder
[Pre-Chorus]
I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, oh
[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now you got me screaming, and I cannot shut up
Oh, shut up, yeah
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I cannot get up
[Pre-Chorus]
And I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, oh
[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter, stutter
[Bridge]
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Gotta stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think
Sinking under, I'm sinking under
[Chorus]
You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
You're just a fantasy girl (You're just a fantasy girl)
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection, I need your perfection (Oh yeah)
'Cause it feels so good, you make me stutter (I really, I really)
You make me stutter (I really, I really)
You make me stutter
