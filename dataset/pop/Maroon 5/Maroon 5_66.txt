[Chorus]
Lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor
[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, where'd you go?
My starlight, my firefly
I've been searchin' high and low
Like all night, my whole life
[Pre-Chorus]
For someone like you to really take my breath away
And I can't be lonely, no, you gon' be the death of me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor
[Post-Chorus]
You got me lovesick
But I love it
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Lovesick, I'm falling, I can't be trusted
If that's what you want, thеn rush in
Trust me when I say, I want this, want this
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lovеsick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor
[Post-Chorus]
You got me lovesick (Yeah)
But I love it
[Pre-Chorus]
For someone like you to really take my breath away
And I can't be lonely, no, you gon' be the death of me, oh
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore (Anymore)
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor
[Post-Chorus]
You got me lovesick (Lovesick)
You got me lovesick, lovesick
You got me lovesick, lovesick (But I love it)
You got me lovesick, lovesick
Yeah
