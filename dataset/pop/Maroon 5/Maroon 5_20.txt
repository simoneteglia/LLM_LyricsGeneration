[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
[Pre-Chorus]
So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh yeah)
[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
[Pre-Chorus]
So let me be
And I'll set you free
[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah
[Bridge]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam
[Refrain]
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
[Outro]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
