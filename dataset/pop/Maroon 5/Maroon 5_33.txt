[Verse 1]
I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes, but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight, but you're slipping out
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
[Chorus]
Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
When did the rain become a storm?
When did the clouds begin to form?
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force
And we'll, we'll be swimming when it's gone
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
[Chorus]
Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah
[Bridge]
All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
And let them go, let them fly
Holding back won't turn back time
Believe me, I've tried
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, how in love were we that night?
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry
[Chorus]
Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, yeah
Hee, oh
