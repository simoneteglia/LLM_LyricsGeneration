[Verse 1]
I need peace, I need hope, I need guidance
I need more than myself
I need light, I need life, I need what I never felt
[Pre-Chorus]
Sisters and brothers are picking sides
And both of our mothers are terrified
And I'm crying out to an empty sky
Tell me
[Chorus]
If I hit the ground
And I fall down to my knees
Would you hear the sound?
Am I crazy to think that we
Could make it out?
Am I crazier to believe
There's a middle ground?
[Verse 2]
I'm so up, I'm so down, I'm so broken
I'm so tired, I can't sleep
I'm not mine, I'm not yours, I'm not sure of anything
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, sisters and brothers are picking sides
And both of our mothers arе terrified
And I'm crying out to an empty sky
Tеll me
[Chorus]
If I hit the ground
And I fall down to my knees
Would you hear the sound?
Am I crazy to think that we
Could make it out?
Am I crazier to believe
There's a middle ground?
[Bridge]
Middle ground, there's a middle ground
I don't need someone to love
I just need someone to live for
Middle ground, there's a middle ground
On my knees where I belong
Please tell me
[Chorus]
If I hit the ground
And I fall down to my knees
Would you hear the sound?
Am I crazy to think that we
Could ever make it out?
Am I crazier to believe
There's a middle ground?
[Outro]
Middle ground, there's a middle ground (Oh)
Crazier to believe there's a middle ground
Middle ground, there's a middle ground (Oh)
I need you to believe, oh, there's a middle ground
