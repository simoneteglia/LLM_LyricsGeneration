[Verse 1]
I watched you cry, bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Obsessed, depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lyin' in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine
[Chorus]
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have, oh yeah
(Just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling)
'Cause I can't believe that it's over
[Verse 2]
You've hit your low, you've lost control
And you wanna come back
You may not believe me, but I gave you all I had
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Undress, confess that you're still mine
I roll around in a bed full of tears
And I'm still lyin' in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine
[Chorus]
She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there (Yeah)
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
(It's just a feeling) Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh)
No, I can't believe that it's over now
(Just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
It's just a feeling, just a feeling that I have, oh
[Bridge]
So much to say
It's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes (Oh, oh)
And in the darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save
[Chorus]
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh)
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
(It's just a feeling) It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh, oh yeah)
[Outro]
I can't believe that it's over
(It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
(Just a feeling) I can't believe that it's over
(It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
Now I can't believe that's it's over, yeah
