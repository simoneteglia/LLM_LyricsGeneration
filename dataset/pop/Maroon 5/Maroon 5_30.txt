[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I'm getting kind of over this
I need a metamorphosis
Are you awake as me?
If not, do you wanna be?
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Ooh, I need some temporary savin'
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating
[Chorus: Adam Levine &
Julia Michaels
]
Help me out, 'cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need somethin' up to calm me down
Help me out, out
[Verse 2: Adam Levine &
Julia Michaels
]
I don't mean to bother you
But there's somethin' that I want from you
Distract me from thinkin' too much
Loose ends all tied up with a touch
[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels
with Adam Levine
]
Ooh, I need some temporary savin'
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating
[Chorus: Adam Levine &
Julia Michaels
]
Help me out, 'cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need somethin' up to calm me down
Help me out, out
[Bridge: Adam Levine &
Julia Michaels
,
Both
]
Hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Yeah, hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out
, help me out
Help me out
,
help me out, out
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Julia Michaels]
Help me out, 'cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need somethin' up to calm me down
Help me out, out
[Outro: Adam Levine &
Julia Michaels
]
And hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out,
help me out
Help me out,
help me out
, out
