[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise
[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
[Post-Chorus]
If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh
[Verse 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed (Oh, stuck in that time when)
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise
[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
And all those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone
[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Now baby, don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
I'm begging you, just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
If happy-ever-after's did exist (Oh, yeah)
I would still be holdin' you like this
And all these fairytales are full of it (Yeah)
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick (Yeah)
Now, I'm at a payphone
