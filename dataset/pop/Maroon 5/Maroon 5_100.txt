[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to do with this time?
If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
But I feel out of control
So petrified, I'm petrified, mm
What am I supposed to do to get by?
Did I lose everything I need to survive?
'Cause at 4 AM, when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or did you just get on with your life?
Oh
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do with these clothes? (Oh)
It's my twisted way of keeping you close (Yeah, yeah)
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or do you get along on your own?
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
[Bridge]
And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand
I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end?
[Chorus]
I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
[Outro]
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Turn around and
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
But I can't tell you if you
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Turn around and runaway (Runaway)
