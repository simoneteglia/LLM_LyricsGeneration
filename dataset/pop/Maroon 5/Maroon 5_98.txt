[Intro]
One, two, three
[Verse 1]
All alone in my room, think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
I keep looping my memories of you in my head
I pretend that you want me
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me
[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about your love
[Break]
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me
[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop, and I can't stop
[Bridge]
What I would give to have you look in my direction
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind
Let me show you
[Chorus]
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you
