[Intro]
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkontê
Sabali, sabali, sabali kayi
Ni kêra môgô
[Verse 1]
I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make a change, time to turn the page
Somethin' isn't right, I don't wanna fight you
We've been through tougher times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around, please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spillin' on my shirt
Somethin' isn't right and I don't wanna fight you
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, you
Come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causin' you pain too
But remember, if you need to cry (Cry)
[Chorus]
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
When did we cross the line? How could we could forget?
Why did we let the pressure get into our heads?
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'Cause somethin' isn't right, I don't wanna fight you
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, you
Come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causin' you pain too
But remember, if you need to cry (Cry)
[Chorus]
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
[Bridge]
Please don't lose your faith
Don't worry 'cause I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face
That I won't let you down, I won't let you down
[Chorus]
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
