[Verse 1]
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down
Take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down
Calm me down
[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
[Verse 2]
So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out
Why don't you help me out?
[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
So you say, "Go, it isn't working"
And I say, "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed
[Bridge]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get
Knockin' so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake, but you can't forget
[Chorus]
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh
So you say, "Go, it isn't working"
And I say, "No, it isn't perfect"
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed, ooh
[Outro]
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
