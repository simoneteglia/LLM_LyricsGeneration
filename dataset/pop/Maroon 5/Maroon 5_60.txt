[Verse 1]
You got in so late, it's Sunday morning
Said that you were leaving, letting go of us
Where did we go wrong?
And now you say you're leaving California
Gotta head back east and wanna leave tonight
Pack your things and go, go!
[Pre-Chorus]
But if you run away, I won't be alright
[Chorus]
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go-o-o-o
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Pick up all the pieces, fight to hold on
Put them back together, do it all for love, oh
Never let it go, oh, yeah
'Cause I don't need a reason just to hold ya
Wipe all of your tears and look you in the eyes
Oh, oh, baby, please don't go
[Pre-Chorus]
But if you run away, I won't be alright
[Chorus]
Even if the sun crashes into us
I won't let go, I won't let go
And I can be your light, stay with me tonight
I won't let go, I won't let go-o-o-o
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Now you say you're leaving California
