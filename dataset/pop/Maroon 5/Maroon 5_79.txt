[Verse 1]
Can you see me floating above your head
As you lay in bed thinking about everything
That you did not do? 'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it
Oh, oh, oh
And I don't trust you 'cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear, I spend every hour waiting
For a phone call that I know will never come
I used to think you were the one, now I'm sick of thinking anything at all
[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
[Verse 2]
Do you remember the way we used to melt?
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you?
Oh, 'cause I remember very well
[Bridge]
And how long has it been, since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you?
And at night when you sleep, do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?
[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you, oh
[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you
[Outro]
I ain't ever coming back to you
