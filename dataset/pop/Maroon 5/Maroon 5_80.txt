[Verse 1]
Looking at the same sky that we used to lay under
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us?
[Pre-Chorus]
When you close your eyes, do you see me, love?
Am I keeping you awake?
What you scared about? Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know
[Chorus]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you
So you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you, coming back for you, yeah
[Verse 2]
I know there are millions of miles in between our hearts
But I will come running for you, I don't care how far
[Pre-Chorus]
When you close your eyes, do you see me, love?
Am I keeping you awake?
What you scared about? Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know
[Chorus]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you
So you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you, coming back for you, yeah
[Bridge]
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry now, now, don't you worry now
[Chorus]
You know that I'm coming back for you (woo!)
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you
So you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you, coming back for you, yeah
