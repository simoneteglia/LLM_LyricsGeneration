[Verse 1]
You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of runaround
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do
[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied til I'm under your skin
[Verse 2]
Immobilized by the thought of you
I'm paralyzed by the sight of you
I'm hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race
[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in (Hey)
And I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah)
[Guitar Solo]
Yeah, oh
(You feel your heart begin to race!)
[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
Yeah, yeah, there may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
