[Verse 1]
Say, what you're mad at me for, me for?
Yeah, why you talk that evil? Yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no
Say, what you're crying at me for, me for?
Try to control your ego, yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no
[Chorus]
'Cause I got all the things I wanna say but nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you, I never, ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know what this is really all about?
It should be really easy if you had nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
[Verse 2]
So, what you spying on me for, me for?
Tell me what you're looking for, yeah
This shit you said is so low, so low
No love, no love, no no
But tell me, where do you go, you go
When you say you need time alone, yeah
You really think I don't know, don't know
I know, I know, I know
[Chorus]
'Cause I got all the things I wanna say but nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you, I never, ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know what this is really all about?
It should be really easy if you had nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
[Post-Chorus]
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll, I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll, I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll, I'll show you mine
I'll, I'll show you mine, yeah
[Bridge]
I can't believe you looked me in the eye
And said to me you had nothing to hide, yeah
Now you're dead to me; this really is goodbye
Goodbye, ooh
[Chorus]
'Cause I got all the things I wanna say but nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you, I never, ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
(Show me that phone, oh)
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know what this is really all about? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
It should be really easy if you had nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl (Show me that phone)
Show me that phone in your pocket (Show me that phone)
[Post-Chorus]
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll, I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
I'll, I'll show you mine
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
[Outro]
Show me that phone in your pocket
