[Verse 1]
You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
[Verse 2]
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
She'll make me want her right now right now
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
[Bridge]
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
[Outro]
My lucky strike, my lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million
