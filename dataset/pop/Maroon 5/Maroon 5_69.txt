[Intro]
Oh!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and I am all alone
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now, I wanna find you, but you're on the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts
[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud
[Verse 2]
Hey you, say that you're only havin' fun, and then
You call me up at 3 AM again
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now (Now) all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts (Oh)
[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud
[Interlude]
Yeah, come on
[Bridge]
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home (Oh)
[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud
