[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh, uh
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
There's somethin' about my ego,
tell her back up, Tim Tebow
Got Tivo up in the ride, I'm leanin' back and my seat low
You need hoes, I just sex 'em
,
bend the ass like Beckham
Undress 'em, respect 'em
Just for the night, then after that I forget them
Neglectin', I'm sorry, girl, turn the house into a party world
Probably gonna get herself played, Atari
No time for tears, if you cryin', call Maury
Got girls by the army, feelin' kinda horny
Love it when I'm on a Benny Blanc beat
Talk cheap, but I spend big
'Cause I
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this, uh
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
[Verse 3: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh
[Chorus: Adam Levine & (
Christina Aguilera
)]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Woo, uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
I've got them moves like Jagger
[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
I'm a rich bastard, Mick Jagger say I got them moves
Always rollin' stone, girls call my phone
Let it ring, I'm way too cool
Get a little bit of dome when I'm in arenas
Messin' with these hoes who be so eager
But no need to tease her, I'ma go with Christina, uh
[Bridge: Christina Aguilera &
Adam Levine
]
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this, uh
[Chorus: Adam Levine &
Christina Aguilera
]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (
Take me by the tongue
)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (
Yeah, yeah
)
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (
Oh yeah
)
I don't needa try to control you (
Ooh
)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you (
Ooh
)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
