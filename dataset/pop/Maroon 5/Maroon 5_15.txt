[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Sunday mornin', rain is fallin'
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shroudin' us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But things just get so crazy, livin' life gets hard to do (Life is hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)
[Chorus]
That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Drivin' slow on Sunday mornin'
And I never want to leave
[Verse 2]
(Yeah) Fingers trace your every outline (Oh yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, oh, woah)
And back and forth, we'll sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
[Chorus]
That may be all I'll need (All I'll need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Drivin' slow on Sunday mornin'
And I never want to leave
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, livin' life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday mornin', rain is fallin' and I'm callin' out to you
Singing, someday it will bring me back to you, yeah
(Someday, oh, someday, oh)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
[Chorus]
You may not know
That may be all I'll need (All I' need)
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Drivin' slow on Sunday mornin'
Drivin' slow, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
There's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Woah, oh, yeah
Woo
(All I need)
Yeah, yeah
(All I see)
Yeah
(Bones with me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(All I need)
(All I see)
