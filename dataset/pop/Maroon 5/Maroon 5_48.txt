[Verse 1]
You're standing there with your cigarette
Looking at me like we've never met
I know I fucked up, so I'll take the blame
And I don't expect you, to let me explain
You can't forgive, I can't forget
I know you're just too different now
[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
[Verse 2]
Now someone else is taking you home, yeah
Hands on the waist, I used to hold
And I know it's my fault
I'm late to the dance
'Cause you couldn't wait for me and I understand
Why you never look back, once that door closed
I know you're just too different now
[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still
Do you still, do you still
Wear that denim jacket?
[Bridge]
You're standing there with your cigarette (yeah)
Looking at me like we've never met
[Chorus]
But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
'Cause the color of that blue sky
Just reminds me of our goodbye
Do you still wear the denim jacket?
I let you get away, I let you get away
[Outro]
Do you, do you still?
Do you, do you still?
Do you wear that denim jacket?
