[Verse 1]
You’re such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathize
I see you out, you never cared
A conversation that we never shared
But it’s so strange, it’s something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I’m alone
Wonder what it’d be like to make you moan
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna give you something better
Than anything you’ve ever had
A stronger and a faster lover
The world, it disappears so fast
[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don’t stop it before it begins
[Verse 2]
So give it up, and don’t pretend
And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won’t regret
The things I whisper in your ear
"What?" I said:
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna give you something better
(You wanna give me something better)
Than anything you’ve ever had
(Than anything I’ve ever had)
A stronger and a faster lover
(A stronger and a faster lover)
The world, it disappears so fast
(It disappears so fast)
[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don’t stop it before it begins
[Verse 3]
I can’t wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
Scratch me with your nails
Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere
Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait?
Don’t think that I can wait
[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don’t stop it before it begins (Hey, yeah)
[Chorus]
Sweet kiwi (Want to give you something better than this)
Your juices dripping down my chin (Hey, yeah)
So please, let me (Want to give you something better than this)
Don’t stop it before it begins
[Outro]
Don’t stop it before it begins
Don’t stop it before it begins
Don’t stop it before it begins
Don’t stop it before it begins
