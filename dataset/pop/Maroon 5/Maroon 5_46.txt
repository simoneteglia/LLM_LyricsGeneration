[Intro: Adam Levine]
I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Quick, give me some Novocaine
It's almost like you're pulling me closer to tell me it's over
But I like the change
I know you think that love's temporary
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
But please don't compare me to
Anybody, anybody, anybody else now, yeah
Tell me you ain't fallin', but I see you on the way down, woah
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
I just can't leave you alone
We keep coming back for more, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So, tell me somethin' about you
Everything you been through
So, what you got to lose?
So, what you got to lose?
It could be about the past
Or something brand new
What do we got to lose?
What do we got to lose?
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
But please don't compare me to
Anybody, anybody, anybody else now (Else now), oh (Oh)
Tell me you ain't fallin', but I see you on the way down, woah
[Chorus: Adam Levine &
Juice WRLD
]
I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
I just can't leave you alone (Ooh)
We keep coming back for more, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me (
Yeah

She throw the pass to the Devil and I intercept, yeah (
Ooh-woah
)
Have you ever had a make out session with death? Yeah (
Oh, yeah
)
In a strip club tryna get all the pretty girls to dance
Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
I remember back in high school, they said I wouldn't stand a chance (
Chance, chance
)
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
I just can't leave you alone (Oh, oh)
We keep coming back for more, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
[Outro: Adam Levine]
So, tell me somethin' about you
Tell me somethin' about you
