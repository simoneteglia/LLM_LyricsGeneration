[Intro]
Ooh, weekend (Weekend), oh
Weekend, I'm beggin' you, love
Stay for the weekend
But if you try, weekend
But if you try, weekend
Weekend, no weak links, no weak links, no weekends
Feel like a kid after school on the weekend
[Chorus]
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to trust
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to love
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun
[Verse]
You wanna leave, I won't stop ya
But you're the one I would die for
The other ones come with sad stories
You're the one I go ride for
Waitin' to fall for over two seasons
In spring, I'm sprung for the wrong reasons
Baby, forgive me for rivers that I can't stop
'Cause my heart freeze in winter
I don't wanna be a savage
Done with summertime madness
Your sunshine works magic
Never thought I would ever know what that is
[Chorus]
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to trust
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to love
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
Oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to trust (Yeah)
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun (Yeah, you're)
I've been livin' it up, try breakin' me down, I'll take it back up
They've been wonderin' where, wonderin' what, I stay in the cut (Oh yeah)
Don't wanna wait in vain, I'm turnin' the page, I'm learnin' to love (Wait in vain)
You're my starlight and moonshine and burnin' sun
[Outro]
Ooh-ooh
Weekend, weekend
