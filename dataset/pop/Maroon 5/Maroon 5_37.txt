[Verse 1]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling (mmm)
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning (mmm)
[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize
[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you
[Verse 2]
All my hidden desires
Finally came alive, mmm
No, I never told a lie
To you, so why would I start tonight?
[Pre-Chorus]
Hazel eyes, I was so colorblind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life, we never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind, but now I realize
[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you
[Bridge]
Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling
[Chorus]
It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied
It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now, I know it was always you, always you
