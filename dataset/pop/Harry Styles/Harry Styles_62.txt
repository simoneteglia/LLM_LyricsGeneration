[Verse 1]
These lines
Make it hard for me, honestly I
Think I'm blind half of the time
And it's gettin' harder to see them
When you are bruised but you can't see it, do you forget how much it hurts at the time?
When you're just starting to feel it
[Chorus]
I'm shit scared to think it'd be here right now
If I never let you down
Life
Will fault you by design
High tides
[Verse 2]
And there's you
Lookin' lost in a hospital bed
Week at mine of guilt in your cryin'
I think you wanted to keep it
[Bridge]
Kills me to think that I let you down
Now you're scared in your hometown
[Outro]
Life
Will fault you by design
And time
Can take you by surprise
High tides
