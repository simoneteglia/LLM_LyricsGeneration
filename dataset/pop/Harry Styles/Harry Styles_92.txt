[Verse 1]
Close your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And I’m hoping you don’t shout about it
Now I know a bunch of people who would waste your time
But I wouldn’t let it happen to a friend of mine
We could write ourselves a story without doing lines
‘Cause believe me, we can live without it
[Chorus]
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
[Verse 2]
Broke a finger knocking on my bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling on the floor
Could never take you home because your skirt’s too short
And your mother would be mad about it
I must admit I married you a thousand times
Had to change my tune when I found out what it’d be like
But I meet you in the hallway almost any time
And we won’t have to talk about it, ah, hey
[Chorus]
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
[Bridge]
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
[Verse 3]
Told it to her brother, to her mother and me
That she wants to be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And, believe me, I am all about it
Painted on your back, I knew we’d get along
But I caught you in the mirror staring way too long
I could love her if I didn’t think I’d do it wrong
I’m gonna have to take you home, hey
[Chorus]
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
