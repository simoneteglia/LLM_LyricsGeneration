[Intro: Alex Salibian]
Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
[Verse 1]
I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen
[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you can see the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should, where I should be
But you're makin' me bleed
[Chorus]
Woman, woman
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman, woman
Woman, woman (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman, woman (Hey)
[Verse 2]
Tempted, you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this (Mmm)
I'm empty, I know
And promises are broken like a stitch is
[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you can see the shape I've been in
While he's touching your skin
This thing upon me howls like a beast
You flower, you feast
[Chorus]
Woman (Ah-ah, ah-ah), woman (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman (Mm), woman (Mm)
Woman (La-da, la-da, la-da), woman (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Wo-woman (Mm), woman
[Outro]
Woman
