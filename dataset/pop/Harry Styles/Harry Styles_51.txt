[Verse 1]
Sometimes a melody is easy
Sometimes you need a word at the end
Sometimes heaven mistreats me
Sometimes the devil just wants a friend
Sometimes the system is broken
Sometimes we [?] what we love, we love
Sometimes the fire need stoking
Sometimes the answer's above
[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never what future will hold till it's gone
Oh, till it's gone coco
Till it's gone coco, oh
[Chorus]
We're coming to life, in a spot life a firefly
We're drowned to the light
Will we ever be, ever be whole
And though you and I, are a moment that's stuck in time
When gravity pulls
We'll never let go, coco
We'll never let go, coco
[Verse 2]
Sometimes you're gonna hit brick walls
Sometimes you'll need to look for an out
Sometimes the world makes you so small
Sometimes you'll [?] with doubt
[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never what future will hold till it's gone
Oh, till it's gone coco
Till it's gone coco, oh
[Chorus]
We're coming to life, in a spot life a firefly
We're drowned to the light
Will we ever be, ever be whole
And though you and I, are a moment that's stuck in time
When gravity pulls
We'll never let go, coco
[Bridge]
My blood is yours and so is my name
Follow your heart, I'll do the same
And when we go, we go together
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
Never let go, coco
[Chorus]
We're coming to life, in a spot life a firefly
We're drowned to the light
Will we ever be, ever be whole
And though you and I, are a moment that's stuck in time
When gravity pulls
We'll never let go, coco
We're coming to life, in a spot life a firefly
We're drowned to the light
Will we ever be, ever be whole
And though you and I, are a moment that's stuck in time
When gravity pulls
We'll never let go, coco
