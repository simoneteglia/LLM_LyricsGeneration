[Verse 1]
Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
[Pre-Chorus]
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
[Chorus]
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
[Verse 2]
I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry
[Chorus]
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
[Post-Chorus]
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
[Bridge]
And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
[Chorus]
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
[Post-Chorus]
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
