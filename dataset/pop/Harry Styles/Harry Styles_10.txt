[Intro: Camille Rowe]
Coucou
[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
I, I confess
I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that
There's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?
[Chorus: Harry Styles,
Camille Rowe
]
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Don't you call him "baby"  (
Coucou
)
We're not talkin' lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me (
Coucou
)
[Outro: Camille Rowe]
Coucou! Tu dors? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Non, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait! Allez!
