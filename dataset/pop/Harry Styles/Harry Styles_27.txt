[Intro]
I saw this angel
(Ooh)
I really saw an angel
(Ooh, ooh)
Hey, hey
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home
to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it
[Chorus]
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meetin' in the hallway every single time
And there's nothin' we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it, hey, hey
[Chorus]
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, ow, ow, hey)
(Wanna die, wanna die)
(Right now)
[Bridge]
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ow)
[Chorus]
She's an angel (Ooh), only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
She's an angel (Ooh), my only angel (Ooh)
She is an angel (Ooh), my-my-my-my only angel (Ooh)
[Outro]
Ow (Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
