[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
Well I think I wrote a song
That all your friends are gonna like
But they'll tell you that they hate it
When they don’t just because it’s mine
And I swear that I’m not thinking about you all the time
It'll only take a minute, take a listen
Maybe change your mind
[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you? (La La Na Na)
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you? (La La Na Na)
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you?
I guess you’ll never know, oh
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
Oh, I Know he’s got the money
Baby honey does he make your night?
Is it true he doesn’t touch you in the place the way I know you like
And I swear that I’m not thinking about you all the time
Just today, yesterday, every day, and tomorrow night
[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you? (La La Na Na)
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you? (La La Na Na)
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you?
I guess you’ll never know, ow
[Outro: Harry Styles]
I swear I'm not thinking about you now
(Over, over, over, over)
I swear I'm not thinking about you now
(Over, over, over, over)
Now I'm getting older
Am I getting over you?
I guess we’ll never know, aye!
Ha!
