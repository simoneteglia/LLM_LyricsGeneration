[Verse 1]
You got a new life
Am I bothering you? Do you wanna talk?
We share the last line
Then we drink the wall till we wanna talk
[Pre-Chorus]
I go 'round and 'round
Satellite
[Chorus]
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
[Post-Chorus]
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya
[Verse 2]
I'm in an L.A. mood
I don't wanna talk to you
She said, "Give me a day or two"
[Pre-Chorus]
I go 'round and 'round
Satellite
[Chorus]
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
[Bridge]
Right here, right here
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya
I'm here, right here
Wishin' I could be there for ya
Be there for ya
Be there for ya, for ya
For ya
Be there for ya
[Chorus]
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in (Spinnin' out, waitin')
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here? (Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya)
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in (For ya, for ya, for ya)
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in (For ya, for ya, for ya)
I can see you're lonely down there (Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya)
Don't you know that I am right here?
