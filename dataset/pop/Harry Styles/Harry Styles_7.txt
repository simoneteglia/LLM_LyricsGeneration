[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with it
I'm here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on my fingertips
And up to your mouth, I'm feelin' it out
I'm feelin' it now (Da, da, da, da)
[Pre-Chorus]
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you t—
[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
[Verse 2]
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are in
I mess around with him
And I'm okay with it (Oh-ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm coming down, I figured out I kinda like it
When I'm all out, I'll think about the way you— (Ha)
[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
[Bridge]
Getting dizzy now
Da-da-da, yeah
Ow!
[Breakdown]
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
[Chorus]
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive (I know you're persuasive)
You got me something, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it (Now I can taste it)
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La-la-la-la-da
