[Intro]
Hoo
Niaga ti ta kcab er'uoy, loof
[Verse 1]
Boyfriends, they think you're so easy
They take you for granted
They don't know, they're just misunderstanding
[Refrain]
You
You, you're back at it again
[Verse 2]
Weakened when you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he's thinking
[Refrain]
You
Love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You
You, you still open the door
[Bridge]
You're no closer to him
Now you're halfway home
Only callin' you when
He don't wanna be alone
Oh, and you go
But why? You don't know
[Verse 3]
Boyfriends, are they just pretending?
They don't tеll you where it's heading
And you know thе game's never ending
[Refrain]
You
You lay with him as you stay in the daydream
You
Feel a fool, you're back at it again
[Outro]
Ooh
