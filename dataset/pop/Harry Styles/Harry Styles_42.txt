[Verse 1]
Candles burnt down
to the floor
Wearing less than you wore before
Shoes sitting by the door
Never put them on
We would stay in my house for days
Spilling breakfast on pillowcases
Your stuff don’t taste the same
Now that you’re gone
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I’m prone to overthinking
One thing goes wrong and I can’t adjust
I’ve lost the taste for the good in us
And I’m sorry
[Chorus]
We had a hunger then
Only each other then
Couldn’t get enough
when we started
Always a hunger then
Now it’s just emptiness
We
were in love,
we were starving
We had a hunger then
[Verse 2]
We could ruin a perfect night
On my birthday I made you cry
You told me you learned to drive
I guess you lied
I could never get sick of you
I just bit off more than I could chew
And
as one year turns into two
I’m still not over you
, still not over you
[Chorus]
We had a hunger then
Only each other then
Couldn't get enough when we started
Always a hunger then
Now it’s just emptiness
We were in love
We were
starving
We had a hunger then
[Bridge]
I guess I’m prone to overthinking
I lost my taste for the good in us
I never call when I knew I should
And I’m sorry, I’m sorry, oh
[Chorus]
We had a hunger then
Only each other then
Couldn’t get enough when we started
Always a hunger then
We had a hunger then
Now it’s just emptiness
We were in love, we were starving
We had a hunger then (Oh)
We had a hunger then
Now it’s just emptiness
We were in love, we were starving
We had a hunger then
