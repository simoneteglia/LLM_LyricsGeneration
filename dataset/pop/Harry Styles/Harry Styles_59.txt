[Intro: All]
Falling, falling, falling, falling
[Verse 1: Perrie &
Jade
]
I'm in my bed and you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I said, it's not what I meant, mmm
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
[Chorus: All &
Jade
]
What am I now?
What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne &
Perrie
]
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe, oh yeah
And it kills me 'cause I know we've ran out of things we can say, oh baby
What am I now?
[Chorus: All]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
[Bridge: All]
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me
Again, again, again, again
[Outro: Jade,
Jesy
&
All
]
Oh my God, oh my God, this feeling's just begun
I'm saying things I've never said, doing this I've never done
Oh my God, oh my God, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop
Feelings, feelings, a feeling 'bout us
Try to fight but it's never enough
My heart is certain, it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm
frozen in motion
and my head tells me to stop
[Chorus: Leigh-Anne,
All
&
Perrie
]
What am I now? What am I now?
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-ba-dum
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin', no
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
Ba-ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-dum, ba-ba-ba-dum
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm
fallin'
