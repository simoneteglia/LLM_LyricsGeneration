[Verse 1]
I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleedin'
Looking for life out there
Readin' your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now
[Pre-Chorus]
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
[Chorus]
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
Out of New York
I'm on the comedown speed
We're on bicycles
Saying, "There's life out therе"
You've got the antidote
I'll takе one to go, go, please
Get the picture, cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now
[Pre-Chorus]
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
[Chorus]
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)
[Outro]
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
