[Verse 1]
Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But, oh
[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
[Verse 2]
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
I know it's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But, oh
[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
[Bridge]
Oh
Oh-oh
Oh
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know
But, oh
[Chorus]
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
You'll bring me home
