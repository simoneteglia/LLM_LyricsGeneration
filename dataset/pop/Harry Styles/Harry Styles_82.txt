[Verse 1]
She said "you make me feel so alone"
She said "you never pick up the phone"
She said "how come you never come home when you say you will?"
Darling I know that you want
Last night I nearly made a mistake
She knows and now she's making me beg
I love her, just don't know how to change
It feels like I'm slipping away
I'm starting to heal and she says
[Chorus]
She said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, you're never there for me
You said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, but I'm gonna try honey
I'm gonna try honey
I'm gonna try
[Verse 2]
Feel lucky when I lay next to you
You fuck me like there's something to prove
One day baby I'll come through
You won't have to ask me to stay
And I won't be hearing you say
[Chorus]
She said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, you're never there for me
You said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, but I'm gonna try honey
I'm gonna try honey
[Bridge]
Hold on
Hold on
Won't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey
Hold on
Hold on
Won't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey
Hold on (Hold on)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey
Hold on (Hold on)
Hold on (Hold on)
Won't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey
[Outro]
You said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, you're never there for me
You said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, but I'm gonna try honey
You said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, you're never there for me
And you said "oh my, oh my, oh my"
You're never there for me, but I'm gonna try honey
I'm gonna try honey
Won't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey
Hold on
Hold on
Won't you hold on for me? I'm gonna try honey
