[Verse 1]
There's just enough in the bottle
Let's turn tonight to tomorrow
I'm always working it's a problem
But you convinced me, now I'm stoppin'
Wasn't expecting a call but
[Chorus]
I'll pick you up on the way home (Ooh, ooh)
I'll pick you up on the way home (Ooh, ooh)
It's been a while, that's okay though
Let's be honest, you called me
So I'll pick you up on the way home (Ooh, ooh)
Ra ka ka ka (Oi)
[Verse 2]
We stayed up till the mornin'
We don't need wine, we need water
Now stop, my mother's calling 'cause It's my sister's birthday
And I forgot to pick up the cake that she ordered
That wet drip dry
Everybody's gonna get hurt sometimеs
[Chorus]
I'll pick you up on the way home (Ooh, ooh)
It's been a while, that's okay though (Ooh, ooh)
I'vе been offline like a payphone
Let's be honest, you called me
So I'll pick you up on the way home (Ooh, ooh)
I'll pick you up on the way home
I'll pick you up on the way home
It's been a while, that's okay though
Let's be honest, you called me
So I'll pick you up on the way home
Ra ka ka ka (Hey)
[Outro]
Well I believe that... I have a suggestion to make
It'll be very easy and smart on my part to, um, you know, I could just pick you up on the way
It'll be pretty easy
It's, you know, just right, right on the way
You know, I can make a detour probably
Won't be too much of a trouble but, you know, It'll be a smarter decision
I think, yeah, you should follow, yeah, I can pick you up on my, on the way
