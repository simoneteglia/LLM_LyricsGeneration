[Verse 1]
Little freak, Jezebel
You sit high atop the kitchen counter
Stay green a little while
You bring blue lights to dreams
Starry haze, crystal ball
Somehow, you've become some paranoia
A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me
[Chorus]
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you
[Verse 2]
Did you dress up for Halloween?
I spilled beer on your friend, I'm not sorry
A golf swing and a trampoline
Maybe we'll do this again
Tracksuit and a ponytail
You hide the body all that yoga gave you
Red wine and a ginger ale
But you would make fun of me, for sure
[Chorus]
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
[Verse 3]
I disrespected you
Jumped in feet first and I landed too hard
A broken ankle, karma rules
You never saw my birthmark
[Chorus]
I was thinkin' about who you are
Your delicate point of view
I was thinkin' about you
I'm not worried about where you are
Or who you will go home to
I'm just thinkin' about you
[Outro]
Just thinkin' about you
Just thinkin' about you
