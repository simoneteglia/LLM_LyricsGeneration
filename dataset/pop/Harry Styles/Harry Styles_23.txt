[Intro]
Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
[Verse 1]
Take a walk on Sunday through the afternoon
We can always find somethin' for us to do
We don't really like what's on the news, but it's on all the time
I take you with me every time I go away
In a hotel, usin' someone else's name
I remember back at Jonny's place, it's not the same anymore
[Chorus]
Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wantеd, to leave you behind
Don't know whеre you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life
[Post-Chorus]
It's unfortunate (Ooh)
Just coordinates (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
I don't know you half as well as all my friends
I won't pretend that I've been doin' everything I can
To get to know your creases and your ends
Are they the same?
[Chorus]
​Baby, you were the love of my life, woah
Maybe you don't know what's lost till you find it
It's not what I wanted, to leave you behind
Don't know where you'll land when you fly
But, ​baby, you were the love of my life
[Instrumental Outro]
