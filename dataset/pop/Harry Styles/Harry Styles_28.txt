[Verse 1]
Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words, 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?
[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
[Verse 2]
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
And I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York
[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
[Bridge]
Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
Tell me something just before you go
[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
[Instrumental Outro]
