[Verse 1]
You were riding your bike to the sound of "It's No Big Deal"
And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
[Chorus]
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
[Verse 2]
Matilda
, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
[Chorus]
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own
[Bridge]
You're just in time, make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh
You don't have to go
You don't have to go home
Oh, there's a long way to go
I don't believe that time will change your mind
In other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore
As long as you can let them go
[Chorus]
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry, no
