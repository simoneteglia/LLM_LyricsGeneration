[Intro]
One, two, three, hey!
[Verse 1]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Don't say it 'cause I know I'm cute (Ooh, baby)
Gucci down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes (Ooh, baby)
I be drippin' so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ (Ooh, baby)
Lit up like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, so is you
That's how I roll
[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm goals)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (So you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
[Post-Chorus]
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
[Verse 2]
No, I'm not a snack at all
Ooh, baby, I'm the whole damn meal (Ooh, baby)
Jeffrey, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel (Ooh, baby)
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this (Like this, like this)
Hold up, baby, please
Don't make me have to take your ooo!
[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine (Yeah, I'm goals)
I was born like this, don't even gotta try (Now you know)
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time (So you know)
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on my Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
[Post-Chorus]
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
[Bridge]
Somebody come get your man
I think he got lost in my DMs (What?) My DMs (What?)
You better come get your man
I think he wanna be way more than friends (What?)
Way more than friends
What do you want me to say?
[Chorus]
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
[Post-Chorus]
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee, ya-ya-ee
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
