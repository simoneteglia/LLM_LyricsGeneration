[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
If you don't love me now (If you don't love me now)
You'll never love me again (Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying (Hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Running in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light
[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
If you don't love me now (If you don't love me now)
You'll never love me again (Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying (Hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
If you don't love me now (If you don't love me now)
You'll never love me again (Never love me again)
I can still hear you saying (Hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
[Bridge]
Hey
Hey
[Outro]
Chain keep us together
Chain keep us together
Chain keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Chain keep us together (Running in the shadows)
Chain keep us together
Chain keep us together
