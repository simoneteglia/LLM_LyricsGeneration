[Intro: Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
I've got a good feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles,
Lucius
]
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us (
Ooh
)
And we'll belong
[Chorus: Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
Given second chances
I don't need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin'
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles,
Lucius
]
And if we're here long enough
We'll see it's all for us (
Ooh
)
And we'll belong
[Chorus: Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
[Bridge: Harry Styles &
Lucius
]
And it's just another day (
And it's just another day
)
And if our friends all pass away (
Oh-oh, oh-oh
)
It's okay (
It's okay, it's okay
)
It's okay
(It's okay, it's okay, yeah)
Hey
Here we go now
[Chorus: Lucius]
Maybe we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
[Outro: Lucius &
Harry Styles
]
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
Maybe we can (
All together now, one more time
)
Find a place to feel good (
Oh yeah
)
And we can treat people with kindness (
Just a little bit of kindness
)
Find a place to feel good (
Ow
)
