[Verse 1]
I don’t know where you're layin'
Just know it's not with me
I don’t know what I'd tell you
If I passed you on the street
[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna, (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
[Verse 2]
I don't know how you taste when
There's smoke in your perfume
So chew me up and spit me out
I've nothing left to lose
[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
[Bridge]
(Anna, you don't know)
(Anna, you don't know)
(Anna, you don't know)
(Anna, you don't know)
(Anna, you don't know)
(Anna, you don't know)
(Anna, you don't know)
(Anna, you don't know)
[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
[Verse 3]
I hope you never hear this
And know that it's for you
I don’t know how I'd tell you
If you asked me for the truth
[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
But you never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
[Guitar Solo and "Faith" Interpolation]
Well I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy
But you don't know what you do to me
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Every time I see your face
There's only so much I can take
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
Oh, Anna (Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na)
[Outro]
Oh, Anna
Oh, Anna
Ow!
