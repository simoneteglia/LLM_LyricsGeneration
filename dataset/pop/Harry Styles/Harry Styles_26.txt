[Intro]
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
[Verse 1]
Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, yeah (Oh)
You're sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted 'round your tongue
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you to get lost
I don't want you to go broke
I want you
[Interlude]
It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, babe
[Chorus]
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
[Verse 2]
"Excuse me, a green tea?"
Music for a sushi restaurant
From ice on rice
Scuba-duba-dubub-boo (Oh)
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for whatever you want
Scuba-duba-dubub-boo (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not going to get lost
I'm not going to go broke
Staying cool
(You know I love you, babe)
[Chorus]
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
[Bridge]
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba)
If the stars were edible
And our hearts were never full
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba)
Could we live with just a taste?
Just a taste
[Interlude]
Ba, ba-ba (It's 'cause I love you, babe)
(In every kind of way)
Ba-ba (Just a little taste)
(You know I love you, babe)
[Chorus]
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
