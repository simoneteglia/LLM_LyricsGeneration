[Verse 1]
I don't know if you can take it
I know you wanna see me naked
I just wanna be your baby
But I can't be around you
[Chorus]
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts (
Wild, wild, wild
)
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild (
Wild, wild, wild
)
When I'm with you, all I get is wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
[Verse 2]
Hope you know I'm for the takin'
Hope you know this cookie's bakin'
I just wanna be your baby
But I can't be around you
[Chorus]
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts (
Wild, wild, wild
)
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild (
Wild, wild, wild
)
When I'm with you, all I get is wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts (
Wild, wild, wild
)
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts (
Wild, wild, wild
)
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts (
Wild, wild, wild
)
Wild, wild, wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild (
Wild, wild, wild
)
When I'm with you, all I get is wild
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
