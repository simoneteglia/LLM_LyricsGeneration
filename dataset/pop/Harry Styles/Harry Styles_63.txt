[Verse 1: Gary Go]
I’ve been walked on
But every time I got up and I walked on
I’ve been lied to
But if I’m really honest, then I lied too
I’ve been hurtin'
But, baby, it was me that did the hurtin'
Oh, I’ve been wantin'
But now I’m on the outside and I want in
[Pre-Chorus: Gary Go]
Yeah, I’ve been losing love
And a lot of sleep
And every bit of us is me
[Chorus: Gary Go]
Oh, will you let me fall?
Will you me fall asleep inside your dreams
And, oh, will you let me call?
Will you let me call and beg on my knees?
Oh, walk with me
And we'll be endlessly
Oh, oh, oh
Walk with me
And we'll be endlessly
[Verse 2: Gary Go]
I’ve been losing
But now I’ve got to win if I’m gonna lose again
I’ve been jumping
But sometimes you just gotta jump in
I feel stronger
Even if I’ll never be as strong as you
Oh, I’ve been working
Because I know that you’ve gotta put the work in
[Pre-Chorus: Gary Go]
Yeah, I’ve been losing love
And a bit of sleep
And every bit of us is me
[Chorus: Gary Go]
Oh, will you let me fall?
Will you let me fall asleep inside your dreams
And, oh, will you let me call?
Will you let me call and beg on my knees?
Hey, walk with me
And we’ll be endlessly
Oh, walk with me
And we’ll be endlessly
[Verse 3: Gary Go]
People told me
They never really knew the old me
But if they knew me
Maybe they would get to know the new me
I’ve been hoping
Trying to find a better way of coping
I’ve been healing
Sometimes you need to dig your heels in
[Pre-Chorus: Gary Go]
Yeah, I’ve been losing love
And a bit of sleep
And every bit of us was a bit of me
[Chorus: Gary Go]
And, oh, will you let me fall?
Will you let me fall asleep inside your dreams?
And, oh, will you let me call?
Will you let me call you up
And beg you please to walk with me
And we’ll be endlessly
Oh, oh, oh
Walk with me
And we’ll be endlessly
Oh, oh, oh
[Post-Chorus]
Are you gonna walk with me?
Are you gonna walk with me, walk with me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Are you gonna walk with me?
Are you gonna walk with me?
Are you gonna walk with me?
Oh
