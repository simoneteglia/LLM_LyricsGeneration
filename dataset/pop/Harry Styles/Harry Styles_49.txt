[Chorus]
We're on that ultralight beam, that ultralight beam
This is everything
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
This is everything, it's every...thing
[Refrain]
I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war
Tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
It's holy war, it's holy war
[Chorus]
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam, baby
This is everything
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
It's everything
[Verse]
Foot on the devil and Iâ€™m moving my family to Zambia
My daughter looks just like Sia, you can't see her
I'm just having fun with this
Know I've feeling so lost
Laugh in my head I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
And Now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby
It's everything
Ooooh
We're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam
It's everything
I'm just having fun with this, know I've been feeling so lost
Laugh in my head I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
And now we're on that ultralight beam, ultralight beam baby
It's everything
