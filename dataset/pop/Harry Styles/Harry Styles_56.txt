[Verse 1]
Over it and overseas
Can I get a moment please? Oh, it's you
Oh, it's you who left a mark on me
Skinny girl and shiny car
Unpaid tab and shitty bar, oh, it's you
Oh, it's you who left a mark on me
[Chorus]
Add some space to cuddle on
Stuck inside my summer home
California
California
(Mm-mm-mm)
[Verse 2]
Kitten scratch and parking fines
Hampstead Heath in summer time, but it's you
Oh, it's you who left a mark on me
Sex bar and masturbate
Skip food a couple days, and it's you
Oh, it's you who left a mark on me
[Chorus]
Add some space to cuddle on
Stuck inside my summer home
California
Summer's death was left to breath
Smell the change and burning peels
California
California
California
