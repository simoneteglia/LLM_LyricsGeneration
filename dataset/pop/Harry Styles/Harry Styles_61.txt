[Verse 1]
Now that we’re done
I wish I wasn’t leaving
We've said it before
Each time with different meaning
I found out too late
This is what you wanted
And there’s no parade
No one to watch me falling down
[Pre-Chorus]
And as my body hits the ground
Doesn’t make a sound
[Chorus]
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
Thought I’d be fine
To get through the night
Alone on the hotel floor
It’s gonna be long
It’s gonna be hard
It’s gonna be painful
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
[Verse 2]
Now you’re with him
I must admit I’m missing
The part of your skin
You always liked me kissing
[Pre-Chorus]
And now as my body hits the ground
It doesn’t make a sound
[Chorus]
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
Thought I’d be fine
To get through the night
Alone on the hotel floor
It’s gonna be long
It’s gonna be hard
It’s gonna be painful
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
[Bridge]
I don’t wanna wait
Waiting everyday
I don’t wanna wait for you
Do we have to change?
Can’t we stay the same?
Living like we used to do
I don’t wanna wait
Waiting everyday
I don’t wanna wait for you
Do we have to change?
Can’t we stay the same?
Living like we used to do
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
I know we’ll move on
As time carries on
I still leave an open door
It’s gonna be long
It’s gonna be hard
It’s gonna be painful
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
Nothing to live for
[Chorus]
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
Thought I’d be fine
To get through the night
Alone on the hotel floor
It’s gonna be long
It’s gonna be hard
It’s gonna be painful
When I’m without, without, without you
There’s nothing to live for
