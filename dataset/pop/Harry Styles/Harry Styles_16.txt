[Intro]
Sunflower
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
[Chorus]
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
[Verse]
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
[Chorus]
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
[Bridge]
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied
Sunflower, sunflower
[Outro]
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Ayy, woo, ow
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Yeah!
Ooh, woo, ooh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
