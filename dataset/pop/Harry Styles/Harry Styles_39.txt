[Verse 1]
Now you were standing there right in front of me
I hold on it's getting harder to breathe
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be
I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you
It lies there alone in it's bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll keep my eyes wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open
[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go,
'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
[Verse 2]
I promised one day that I'd bring you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll keep my eyes wide open, yeah
[Chorus]
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go,
'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me go
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go,
'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me go
'cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me, don't let me go
'Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone
