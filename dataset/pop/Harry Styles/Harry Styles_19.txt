[Verse 1]
Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you, mmm, yeah
When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everything I can to help you through
[Pre-Chorus]
If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby
[Chorus]
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
[Verse 2]
I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming, too
[Pre-Chorus]
If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happiеr, baby
[Chorus]
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until thе morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
[Post-Chorus]
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (Can't get you off my mind)
I won't even try (I won't even try)
To get you off my mind (Get you off my mind)
[Chorus]
We've been doin' all this late-night talkin'
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind
[Post-Chorus]
Can't get you off my mind (All this late-night talking)
Can't get you off my mind (All this late-night talking)
I won't even try (All this late-night talking)
Can't get you off my— (All this late-night talking)
