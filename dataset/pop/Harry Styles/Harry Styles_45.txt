[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
Yeah, looks like we've made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there some day
[Pre-Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
They say, "I bet they'll never make it."
But just look at us holding on
Weâ€™re still together, still going strong, oh
[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
Glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles &
Kacey Musgraves
&
Both
]
They said (
They said
)
"I'll bet (
I'll bet
),
they'll never make it
"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong, oh
[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night
Still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
Still the one I want for life
Still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
Still the one I kiss good night
[Outro: Harry Styles &
Both
]
So glad we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
