[Intro]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh
[Verse 1]
Livin' in a daydream
She said, "Love me like you paid me"
You know I’ll be gone for so long
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Stay until the morning
'Cause, baby, lovin' you’s the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
(All of your love, give me something to dream about)
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh
Oh, no
Ah
Ah
[Bridge]
Livin' in a daydream
Livin' in a daydream
Livin' in a daydream
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
[Chorus]
Livin' in a daydream
Livin' in a daydream (It's alright)
Livin' in a daydream
(Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about)
Give me all of your love
Ooh-ooh (Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about)
Woo (It’s alright)
Woo (Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about)
