[Intro]
Hey!
Mmh, yeah
Ooh-ooh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Why should I go and settle for glitter
When I could shine like gold?
Why should I wait around and just sit here
When I could save my soul?
[Pre-Chorus]
So tonight
I'mma breathe you in 'til I'm high
I'mma lose myself to the light
'Til I'm seeing stars in my eyes
I, I
[Chorus]
I do, I do what I like
Let's go have some fun tonight
I'm trying with different lights
But you can bet I'll try it twice
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free
Hey!
[Verse 2]
I know it all could be gone in a minute
I wanna live out loud, no, no, no
I gotta get what I want when I want it
And you can't hold me down
[Pre-Chorus]
So tonight
I'mma breathe you in 'til I'm high
I'mma lose myself to the light
'Til I'm seeing stars in my eyes
So what we say, hey
[Chorus]
I do, I do what I like
Let's go have some fun tonight
I'm trying with different lights
That you can bet I'll try it twice
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free (I do, do, do)
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free
[Bridge]
I just wanna have fun
When it comes to my vices
I'll try anything once
Maybe twice if I like it (just, just, just wanna have fun)
'Cause I wanna have fun
Yeah, whatever the price is (just, just, just wanna have fun)
I'll try anything once
Maybe twice if I like it (hey)
Just wanna have fun (do what I want, when I want, when I want it)
When it comes to my vices
I'll try anything once (do what I want, when I want, when I want it)
Maybe twice if I like it
'Cause I wanna have fun (do what I want, when I want, when I want it)
Yeah, whatever the price is
I'll try anything once
(Oh, oh, oh, yeah, hey)
[Chorus]
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free (hey)
Hold my hand, it's alright
We'll be good for tonight
'Cause we're high and we're wild and we're free
Lemme hear you say it
Do what I want, when I want, when I want it
(Hey, hey, hey-hey)
Do what I want, when I want, when I want it
(Do what I want, when I want, what, when I want it)
Do what I want, when I want, when I want it
(Do what I want, when I want, what, when I want it)
Do what I want, when I want, when I want it
High, wild, free
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Hey!
Uh-uh-hey
And you can bet I'll try it twice
