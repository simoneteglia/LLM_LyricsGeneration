[Verse 1]
What are we waiting for?
Are you in or out?
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Hold my hand
Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
What's a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?
[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby
[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (
Hey
)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (
Ooh-hoo
)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(
I wanna be
) yours
(
I wanna, wanna be)
yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be
(Eh-eh-ah-eh)
[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby
[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (
Hey
)
I
wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (
Ooh-hoo
)
A
re you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(
I wanna be
) yours
(
I wanna, wanna be) yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
[Bridge]
I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine
[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (
Hey
)
I
wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (
Ooh-hoo
)
A
re you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(
I wanna be) yourY
(
I wa
nna, wanna be) yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
