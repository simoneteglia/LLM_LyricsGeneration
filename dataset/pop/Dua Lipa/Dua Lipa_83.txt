[Verse 1]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep pretty darlin', do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
[Chorus]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darlin', do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
And I will sing a lullaby
[Verse]
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home
Sleep, pretty darlin', do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
