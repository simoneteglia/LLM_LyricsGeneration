[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
[Verse 1]
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat
[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
[Verse 2]
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through
[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
[Bridge]
I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?
[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
