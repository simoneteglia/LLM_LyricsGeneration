[Verse 1]
One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops and it's not me to be one
To be one, one of many
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking, I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking, I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya
One out here for ya
[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still
Let me show ya, that kind of woman (Woman)
[Post-Chorus]
(That kind of woman, woman)
(That kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still
Any longer, that kind of woman
[Verse 2]
I'll pick you from the crowd, don't come to me
I want you to myself
, no, I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one, one of many
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's a hundred others speaking, I've been tryna make a step
A hundred others speaking, I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya
One out here for ya
[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still
Let me show ya, that kind of woman (Woman)
[Post-Chorus]
(That kind of woman, woman)
(That kind of woman)
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still
Any longer, that kind of woman
[Bridge]
(Gonna) Keep you close, next to me, I won't let you go
(You're gonna) Reminisce that you once met a girl like this
The first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
(That kind of woman)
[Chorus]
I'll be the first to say, "Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya, that kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman)
(That kind of woman)
[Outro]
Hard to pretend, now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman
