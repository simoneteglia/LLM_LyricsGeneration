You're my cold heart

[Verse: Elton John]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (
Oh
)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (
No, no, no, no, no
)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa
with Elton John
]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (
Oh
)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (
No, no, no, no, no
)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa
with Elton John
]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (
No, no, no, no, no
)
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart (
Oh
)
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby (
Oh
)
Just passin' through (
No, no, no, no, no
)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (
No, no, no, no, no
)
And this is what I should have said
(
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
)
(
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
)
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
(
I'm not the man they think I am at home
)
(
Oh, no, no, no
) (
No, no, no, no, no
)

No, no, no, no, no
