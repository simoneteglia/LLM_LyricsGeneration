[Verse 1]
I bet we're higher than the people on Cloud 9
This connection got me feeling like I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So why do I think of losing you when you're right by my side? Uh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up
[Chorus]
So baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
[Post-Chorus]
And baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
[Verse 2]
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks on my imagination, ruining my night, wow
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna tell me it's goodbye, uh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up
[Chorus]
So baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
[Post-Chorus]
And baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
[Bridge]
(So baby, don't you let go)
I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear (The thought of you with someone kills me)
Like what if you left me here (I'll be dancing with my heart broke)
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears? (Such a sad disco if it ain't me; Tears)
[Chorus]
So baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
[Outro]
And baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
