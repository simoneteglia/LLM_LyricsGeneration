[Verse 1]
My friends are callin', since the mornin'
They've been blowin' my phone
I've been busy gettin' busy for I don't know how long
They think I'm missin'
But the only thing missin' is my clothes (Ooh)
Our clothes (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
We'll never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)
[Chorus]
No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
[Post-Chorus]
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
[Verse 2]
Call it insomnia, but this is just the thing that I like
'Cause when you're on me, I get hungry, got a big appetite
Wanna feel the rush, runnin' through my blood
Baby, don't open the blinds (Ooh)
All night (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
We'll never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)
[Chorus]
No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
[Bridge]
I gon' need all the extra hours
You and me all up in this room
You gon' need all the extra power
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We gon' need all the extra hours
To do the things I want to do
We gon' need all the extra power
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom, zoom)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
We'll never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)
[Chorus]
No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
[Chorus]
No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more
