[Intro: Dua Lipa]
Ooh, ooh
[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Baby, I've been feedin' the addiction
Flyin' from there and back, felt like an acrobat
Blue eyed, so I fell into submission
Needed to catch myself, like what the hell?
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're steppin' up, steppin' up, ah, ah
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Dua Lipa
]
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Stopped thinking like a victim
This time, I'll throw it back
Boy, can you handle that?
Got you trippin', gave you no attention
That's when I figured out what you're about
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up (Yeah), wake you up (Yeah)
Push you 'til you break
Now you're steppin' up, steppin' up, ah, ah
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Dua Lipa
]
Why are you only good to me (Hey)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah
When I'm bad to you? (So bad)
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
[Bridge: Ariana Grande,
Dua Lipa
&
Both

Why are you only?
W-w-why are you only?
(Why are you?)
Why are you only?
You ain't ready for this type of power
You ain't ready for this, and you know it, know it, know it
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Dua Lipa
]
Why are you only good to me
(Oh, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
(When I'm bad to you)
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me
(Oh-oh-eh)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me
(Ooh)
When I'm bad to you? (When I'm bad to you)
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (So good)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
