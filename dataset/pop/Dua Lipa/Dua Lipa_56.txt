[Verse 1]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking out
[Chorus 1]
Ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me child and all
[Verse 2]
I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face, yeah
[Chorus 2]
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind now
Than to see you walk away from me
[Outro]
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
