[Intro]
Tonight
Tonight
[Verse 1: Kylie Minogue]
Feel my heartbeat
It's the same old feeling coming over me tonight
Me tonight
Feel it buzzing
Said I'm never gonna call, but tonight, I think I might
Think I might
[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?
[Chorus: Kylie Minogue & Dua Lipa]
I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
[Verse 2: Kylie Minogue]
Major mistake
No, I never shoulda gone, baby, I was on the run
On the run
It was heartbreak
I can't stand another day knowin' that you are the one
You're the one
[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Gave my heart a ride, bump in the night
No one can take me higher
Know it's been a while, baby, a while
Do you still feel the fire?
[Chorus: Kylie Minogue & Dua Lipa]
I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
Dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
[Post-Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
Real groove, real groove
We-we got that real groove, ah
(We got that real groove)
[Bridge: Dua Lipa &
Kylie Minogue
]
Hey,
woo, woo, woo
Let's go,
ah!
Dua's got that real groove
Kylie
Woo, woo
Real groove, real groove
We-we got that real groove, ah
Real groove, real groove
We-we got that real groove, ah
[Chorus: Kylie Minogue & Dua Lipa, (Kylie Minogue)]
I saw you dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
Dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
Dancing with somebody
Looking like me and you (Yeah)
She know how to party
But nothing like me and you (Yeah)
Got that perfect body
But she ain't got the moves (No, oh)
We got something better
Got that real groove, baby
