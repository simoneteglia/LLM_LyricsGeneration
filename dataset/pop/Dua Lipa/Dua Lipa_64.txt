Lyrics from snippet
[Verse 1: FKA twigs]
When I put my hands in the air
Look, look, I move like this
When I put my leg up back, forth, back
Look, look, I move like this
When I let my hips sink way, way, down
Look, look, I feel like this
When I flip my hair like up, down, to the middle
I'm a rockstar, just a little
Pay attention, grow up
I'm educatin' (Show up)
[Pre-Chorus: FKA twigs &
Dua Lipa
]
Good girl when I met your mother
True love one way or another
I feel let down just a little bit
(
I feel let down just a little bit
)
One day we partied, we livin'
The next I'm down in my feelings
So hurt, my heart is a-bleeding
(
My heart is a-bleeding
)
[Chorus: FKA twigs & Dua Lipa]
Why, why don't you love me?
Why, why don't you love me?
Why, why don't you lovе me?
Anymore, anymore?
W-Why, why don't you lovе me?
Why, why don't you love me?
Why, why don't you love me?
Anymore, anymore? (Ah, ah)
[Post-Chorus: FKA twigs & Dua Lipa]
Who'd hurt me in a world like this?
Who'd hurt me in a world like this?
You hurt me in a world like this
You're dead when I say so
Who'd hurt me in a world like this?
Who'd hurt me in a world like this?
You hurt me in a world like this
You're dead when I say so
