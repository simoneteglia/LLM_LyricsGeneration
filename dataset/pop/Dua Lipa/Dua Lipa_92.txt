[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spilling drinks on my settee
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go, was sorta hoping that you'd stay
Baby, we both know that the nights are mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you
[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you
Feel the same as I do
We could be together
If you wanted to
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I wanna know if this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go, was sorta hoping that you'd stay
Baby, we both know that the nights are mainly made
For saying things that you can't say tomorrow day
[Chorus]
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
