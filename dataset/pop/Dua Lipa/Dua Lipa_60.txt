[Verse 1]
What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?
[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
[Verse 2]
What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me
[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
[Bridge]
And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together
[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because you're running low on gear?
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
