[Intro]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
[Verse 1]
Will you protect me from the things that I want?
Will you be down and leave the second we're done?
I got one thing I want, I know that it's wrong
But I like to play with fire
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless
[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you
[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
[Verse 2]
The taste of chaos on the tip of my tongue
I kinda like the crazy girl I've become
It's about time that I just have me some fun
'Cause I like to play with fire
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless
[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you
(I got a bad idea, ha)
[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
[Bridge]
(Ah)
(No, I can't help myself)
(Ah)
Ha
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I don't care because I like it (I like it)
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
But I won't stop because I like it
[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
(I got a bad idea)
It's a bad idea (No, no, no)
But I can't help myself (Help myself), no, I can't help myself (Help myself)
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself (Help myself), so I'll just help myself to you
[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
Why's it so much better when we're not together? (Not together)
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
(I got a bad idea)
