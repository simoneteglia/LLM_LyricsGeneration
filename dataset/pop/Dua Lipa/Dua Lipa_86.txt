[Verse: Elton John]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
(No, no, no, no, no)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in
[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
(Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
(No, no, no, no, no)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
(No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in
(No, no, no, no, no)
[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
(Oh)
Just passin' through
(No, no, no, no, no)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
(No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have ever said
(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)
('Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find)
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in
(I'm not the man they think I am at home)
(Oh, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no, no)
[Outro]
(Oh)
(Oh)
(No, no, no, no, no)
