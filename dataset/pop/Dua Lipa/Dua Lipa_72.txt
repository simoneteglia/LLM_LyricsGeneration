[Verse 1]
Gotta get something off of my chest, can I get a witness?
Yeah, I got tattoos all on my skin, but scared of commitment
And I keep saying that I love you, I wish you would listen
I wish you would listen
But there's something missin', mh
[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?
[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (
if I lose myself
)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (
if I lose myself
)
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna have to choose between you or having my freedom
Baby, I don't wanna let go of us or what I believe in
I don't wanna feel like I need to leave, don't give me a reason
Don't give me a reason
You know that I mean it, mh
[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?
[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely, oh oh yeah (
if I lose myself
)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (
if I lose myself
)
[Bridge]
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Just one thing that's on my mind)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(Yeah, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)
[Breakdown]
Ahh, if I lose myself
Ahh, yeah
If I give a little more of me
Would I lose myself completely?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (
if I lose myself
)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (
if I lose myself
)
[Outro]
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Oh, ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I give you, if I give you, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me
