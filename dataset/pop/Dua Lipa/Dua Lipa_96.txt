[Intro]
Let's go
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Partial Chorus: Dua Lipa]

My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
