[Verse 1]
I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah
[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to
[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
[Verse 2]
Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah
[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to
[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
[Bridge]
Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief, keep the love
Just gimme a piece of that, one piece of that
Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to
[Outro]
Ah-ooh
My body, my body, my body (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
Yeah (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
