[Intro]
Okay
Mm, ah
[Chorus]
I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini
[Verse 1]
Time is passin' like a solar eclipse
See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss
It's your moment, baby, don't let it slip
Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?
[Chorus]
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini
[Post-Chorus]
If you're good enough, you'll find the way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change (Her ways)
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay
[Verse 2]
Everything you say is soundin' so sweet (Ah-ah)
But do you practise everythin' that you preach?
(Ah-ah)
I need something that'll make me believe (Ah-ah)
If you got it, baby, give it to me
[Chorus]
They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go (I come and I go)
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows (I'm not here for long)
Catch me or I go Houdini
[Post-Chorus]
If you're good enough, you'll find the way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change (Her ways)
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay
[Bridge]
Oh-oh
Ooh
[Chorus]
I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me (Ooh)
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini (Hahaha)
I come and I go (I come and I go)
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows (I'm not here for long)
Catch me or I go Houdini
[Outro]
Houdini
Catch me or I go Houdini
