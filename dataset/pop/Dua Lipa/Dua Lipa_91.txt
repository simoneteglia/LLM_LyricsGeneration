[Verse 1: Saweetie]
Mmm
I've been winnin' since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you 'bout to get much sicker
'Cause I'm lookin' in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Bacon, baby, here's what's poppin', rich with six-plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, takin' meetings in LA
Glowin' up and blowin' up, that's what I'm 'bout to do
When it's all been happenin' since I left you
[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off, I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done, I've been movin' on
Since we said goodbye
I cut you off, I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
[Verse 3: Dua Lipa]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol, so
I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So I cut you off, I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done, I've been movin' on
Since we said goodbye
I cut you off, I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Get up off your knees 'cause
Boy, I don't give a fuck
[Verse 4: Saweetie]
How it feel, how it feel, how it feel?
Sign off on our connection, then I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept it hunnid, man, you shoulda kept it real
'Cause I realized you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
'Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur
[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
Cut you off, I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why (I'll tell you why)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up (Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck (Boy, I don't give a)
[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (Get to me)
Get up off your knees 'cause
Boy, I don't give a fuck
