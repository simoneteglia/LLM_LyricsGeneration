[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
I bet we're higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So I do, I think of losing you
And you're right by my side, huh
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
[Verse 2: Normani]
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks with my imagination
Ruining my night, well
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it's goodbye, uh
[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up
[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Normani]
So baby don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
So baby don't you let go
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
Like what if you left me here
And I feel the floor with my sequin tears
[Chorus: Dua Lipa,

So baby don't you let go
(Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
(Heart broke)
Such a sad disco
(Disco)

And baby if you ever
(Ever)
(Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see

I'll be dancing with my heart broke
(Heart broke)
Such a sad disco
