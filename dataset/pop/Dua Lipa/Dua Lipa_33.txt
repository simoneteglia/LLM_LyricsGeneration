[Verse 1]
I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
[Verse 2]
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
[Bridge]
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily, tread
[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (
Tread heavily
), swan song (
Tread
)
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (
Tread heavily
), swan song (
Tread
)
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight (
Tread heavily
)
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
[Outro]
It's a new life
