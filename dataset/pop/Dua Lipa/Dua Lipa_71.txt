[Intro]
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad
Real, real sad
Che-che-che-che-cherry
[Verse 1]
Can you tell me how this happen?
'Cause I'm goin' insane
I thought we were everlastin', how did it get this way?
You knew that this shit would hurt me
You cause my heart to break
You pulled this stunt a million times, but never quite this way
[Pre-Chorus]
How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say?
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way?
You know I trusted you
You know I trusted you
Do you feel any shame?
Thought we were one and the same
Gave you the shirt off my back, gave you the key to my place
You know I trusted you
But now I'm done with you
[Chorus]
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you just took him by the hand
Now he's never ever comin' back
Just like that (Like that), oh-oh-oh
He never came back, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry
[Verse 2]
I am not the one to tell you, how to live your life
But you can have my sloppy seconds, keepin' mine alright
[Pre-Chorus]
How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say?
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way?
You know I trusted you
You know I trusted you
Do you feel any shame?
Thought we were one and the same
Gave you the shirt off my back, gave you the key to my place
You know I trusted you
But now I'm done with you
[Chorus]
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you just took him by the hand
Now he's never ever comin' back
Just like that (Like that), oh-oh-oh
He never came back, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Che-che-che-che-cherry
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you just took him by the hand
Now he's never ever comin' back
Just like that, oh-oh-oh
He never came back, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Real, real sad, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha)
Cherry, you just took him by the hand
Now he's never ever comin' back
Just like that, oh-oh-oh
He never came back, oh-oh-oh
Che-che-che-che-cherry
