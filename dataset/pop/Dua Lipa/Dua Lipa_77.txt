Lyrics from
GRAMMY performance
[Verse]
Are you someone that I can give my heart to?
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night
[Pre-Chorus]
But if you really wanna go there
You should know I
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've ever know
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo
[Post-Chorus]
Are you somebody who can go therе?
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya
If that ain't you then lеt me know, yeah
'Cause training season's over
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close
Deeper than I've never known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
[Outro]
'Cause trainings season's over
Training season's over
Lyrics from
Snippet
[Pre-Chorus]
Who understands I
[Chorus]
Need someone to hold me close?
Deeper than I've never known
Whose love feels like a rodeo
Knows just how to take control
When I'm vulnerable
He's straight talking to my soul
Conversation overload
Got me feeling vertigo (Vertigo)
