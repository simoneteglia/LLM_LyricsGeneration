[Verse 1]
I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
[Chorus]
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I’m all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
[Verse 2]
There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms, ’cause
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
[Chorus]
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
[Bridge]
Lo-oh-oh-ove
Lo-oh-oh-ove
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Lo-oh-oh-ove
Lo-oh-oh-ove
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
(Love is a religion!)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion!)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
[Chorus]
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees (Knees)
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me (Me)
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need (Need)
They say love is religion (Oh-oh, whoa)
So say a prayer with me
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees (Knees)
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me (Me)
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
[Outro]
Love is a religion!
