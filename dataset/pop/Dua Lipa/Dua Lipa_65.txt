[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
(Hey, hey, hey go!)
Ladies and gentleman
Dua Lipa!
[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
We are wicked men
Looking for buckles to loosen
By the Count of 10
I wanna see somebody human
And I lost what it was
In the clear blue dust
Of a Downtown Romeo
In a couple of weeks
You can tell all the freaks
How you carried my body home
[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
Dear Mr. Lonely
How much could you know me?
I could find lessons in light
But once you've earned it
You've already burned it
[Chorus: Dua Lipa,
Troye Sivan
]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
Woo!
[Verse 2: Troye Sivan,
Dua Lipa
]
Got my ticket man and I'm looking
For somebody to use it
I know we pretend
But one of these days
We're gonna lose it
And I once left town
When the leaves turned brown
With a couple of souvenirs
She was in my car
When we hit that wall
Yeah it could've move me to tears
[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
But once it's over, it's all really over
[Chorus: Dua Lipa,
Troye Sivan
]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
(Hey, hey, hey!)
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa,
with Troye Sivan
,
Troye Sivan
]
But tonight I crossed the line
I used to know her
When my house was sober
I could find lessons in light
Over and over, is it really over?
[Chorus: Dua Lipa,
Troye Sivan
]
I don't wanna see you go
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
Why'd it take so long to know?
I want somebody to love me
(Need somebody oh)
I want somebody to be nice
See the boy that I once was in my eyes
Nobody's gonna save my life
