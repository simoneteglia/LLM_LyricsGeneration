[Intro: JID]
We doin' good
We doin' good
That's your problem
[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Pulling me down like an anchor
Sayin' it's my fault, you're angered
Telling me no one will love me (Watch your mouth)
Telling me I'm gon' be lonely
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)
You and me on for a good run
Thinking that you were a good one
Under your palm, yeah, you like that (What the fuck?)
Now it's my turn to bite back (I've had enough)
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa &
JID
]
Ooh, did it to yourself (Yourself)
Playing with my mind (My mind)
Putting me through hell (
Hell
)
Ooh, I'd be broken too (Too)
If you left me like (Me like) like I left you
That's your problem
[Chorus: Dua Lipa &
JID
]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (
That's your problem
)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (
That's your problem
)
[Verse 2: Dua Lipa,
JID
]
Doin' it all for reaction
Doing the most in your caption
Making me seem like the bad guy (Watch your mouth)
Try to bring me down, but nice try
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)
I used to like you
How did I like you? (What the fuck?)
I used to like you
And now I don't (
We doin' good
)
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa &
JID
]
Ooh, I'd be broken too (Too)
If you left me like (Me like) like I left you
That's your problem
[Chorus: Dua Lipa &
JID
]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (
That's your problem
)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (
That's your problem
)
[Verse 3: JID]
I thought I liked you, I thought you was cool
But I'm a thot when I be drinking, don't be thinking shit through
Nevertheless, you got the clue, and now you blue
'Cause I ain't speaking to you
Aww booboo, you'll be cool
Don't boo-hoo, boo, what's the issue?
GGG's listening
, this
BD
, she trippin'
I'm dippin', I'm dippin', I'm done with it
I'm stupid, I'm dumb, come with it
I heard 'em all, I'ma call you one name
(That's your problem)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa &
JID
]
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (
That's your problem
)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Cryin' all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (
That's your problem
)
