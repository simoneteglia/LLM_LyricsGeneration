[Verse 1]
We're kissin’ on the concrete floor, the third day of the rave
Berlin summer, I knew I loved you then
Fireworks lit the sky, we're runnin' through a burnin’ field
Baby, just you and I
[Pre-Chorus]
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It's cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you
[Verse 2]
We're runnin' down the country road in 2018
It was only you and me, and nothin' in between (Oh I, oh yeah)
And the trees are movin', in slow motion
Drunk and dancin'
[Pre-Chorus]
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
If I lost you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And you lost me (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
I’ll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It’s cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you
[Bridge]
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, hmm
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Berlin summer
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Berlin summer
[Pre-Chorus]
If I lost you (Berlin summer)
And you lost me (Berlin summer)
If I lost you (Berlin summer)
And you lost me (Berlin summer)
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
I'll always remember, the way we used to move
You and me together, all I can see was you
It’s cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you
[Outro]
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, yeah)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm (Oh yeah, hmm)
