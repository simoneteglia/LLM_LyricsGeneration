[Verse 1]
I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down
[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"
[Chorus 2]
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down
[Bridge]
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down
[Outro]
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby shot me down
Oohh-oh-oh
My baby shot me down
Shot me down
Shot me down, down, down, down, down
