[Intro: Take A Daytrip]
(Hey!)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)
[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)
[Bridge]
(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck
[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (Ah)
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head (Messing with my head)
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us good in bed)
[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Mmm)
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
