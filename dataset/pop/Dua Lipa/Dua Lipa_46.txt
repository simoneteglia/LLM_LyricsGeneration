[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
In the whip on a Tuesday night with the music high
And you by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide
Top down and the moon is high and the mood is right
And you're by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide, yeah
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Late night conversations
Electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin'
Mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah, yeah (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah)
[Verse: Young Thug]
I been catchin' love off a backboard
Runnin' from your love, that's what this track for
Fuckin' every bitch and never tell 'em, no
I'm pushin' P, they black and white, a Oreo
I been catchin' love off a backboard
Runnin' from your lovе, that's what this track for
Buyin' niggas' bitches from the corner storе
Thug, why you wanna do that? I don't need this love
Ball like Lebron James in the finals
We
14Hunna
, just like a minor
I'm yellin' "Free Big Meech" with designers
Fifteen million hoes 'cause I'm undecided
I'm kickin' shit, karate, ooh
I'm servin' bricks somebody hood
Fucked a bitch, catch a charley, ooh
Gucci flip flops
and joggers, ooh
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
In the whip on a Tuesday night with the music high
And you by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide
Top down and the moon is high and the mood is right
And you're by my si-i-ide, si-i-ide, yeah (Ah, ah)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Late night conversations
Electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin'
Mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah, yeah
[Bridge: Young Thug]
Feelin' fly tonight, yeah, yeah
Goin' with the motherfuckin' vibe, yeah
It's goin' down tonight, oh, yeah
But don't you leave, don't you move
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom 'bout you, ayy, oh
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Late night conversations
Electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin'
Mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah, yeah (Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah)
[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex
And it's a potion, yeah
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah
[Outro: Young Thug]
(Huh)
