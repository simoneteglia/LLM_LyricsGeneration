[Verse 1: HWASA]
서로의 눈치만 보지만
네 속마음 들킨걸 아는걸
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
감정을 속이려 하는 너
시간 없어 넌
just wasting time
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree, bae?
[Pre-Chorus: HWASA]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
[Chorus: HWASA,
Dua Lipa
]
이 밤은 흘러가고
더는 숨기려고 해도 의미없어
So come on (
Come on
), come on (
Come on
), come on (
Come on
)
Let's get physical
이 방의 문을 닫고
둘이 서만 함께 하는 이 공간에서
So come on (
Come on
), come on (
Come on
), come on
Let's get physical
[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Hold on
너와 나의 케미
Come on, hold on
거부할 수 없어
Come on
(Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
Hold on
Just a little tighter
Come on, hold on
Tell me if you're ready
Come on (Come on, come on)
Baby, keep on dancing
Let's get physical
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
[Outro: Dua Lipa,
Both
]
Let's get physical (Physical, physical)
Physical (Physical, physical)
Let's get physical
(Physical, physical)
Come on, phy-phy-phy-physical
