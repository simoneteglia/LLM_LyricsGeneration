[Intro: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter—
[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Place where I can
[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Ooh, you'll really wanna know where I've been all this time
So lemme tell ya
Ooh, got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like
Livin' out of the scene, out in the wild
Learnin' to breathe
Up in the clouds, far from the crowds
I can't believe I can be loud
Holdin' hands with the darkness and knowin' my heart is allowed
Allowed
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away?
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter—
[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Place where I can
Place where I can
[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
As I fantasize
So much to see, I'm in paradise, oh, I
Always seems I'm new inside
Deep, deep down in me, I go now, baby, born to fly, oh, I
Now see, how could it be?
We will find our way, we'll find the things we seek, ooh-ee
You see, I'm mesmerized
This is just for me and I am cuttin' ties, goodbye
Ooh, no, no, no, no
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter—
[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Place where I can
Place where I can
[Bridge: Selena Gomez]
Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Oh), oh woah
Head is so clear (So clear)
A sweeter place, my sweeter place
Having no fear (No fear)
Heaven is near (Oh), oh woah
Head is so clear (So clear)
My sweeter place, my sweeter place
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Is there a place where I can hide away? (Hide away)
Red lips, french kiss my worries all away (All away)
There must be a sweeter place
We can sugarcoat the taste
Sweeter place
There must be a sweeter—
