[Verse 1]
Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in, there's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin'
I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreamin'
[Pre-Chorus]
I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
"I'm never gonna amount to much"
But they're never gonna change my mind, no
[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
[Verse 2]
Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doin'
This life I'm pursuin', the odds I'd be losin'
Everybody tells me that it's one in a million, no
One in a billion, oh, one in a zillion
[Pre-Chorus]
I hear it every day
I hear it all the time
"I'm never gonna amount to much"
But they're never gonna change my mind, no!
[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
[Bridge]
Selena, hit the track like Katrina, making waves
Like Cold Medina, make them say, "I'm ready!"
Are you ready for it? (
Yeah, I'm ready for it
)
Really ready for it? (
Yeah, I'm ready for it
)
I'm on my way
I know I'm gonna get there someday
It doesn't help when you say it won't be easy
[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know (Tell me)
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Like how many inches in a mile
What it takes to make you smile
Get you not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know (Tell me)
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
[Outro]
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know  (Tell me)
Somethin' I don't know
Somethin' I don't know
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know  (Tell me)
Somethin' I don't know (Tell me)
Somethin' I don't know (Tell me)
