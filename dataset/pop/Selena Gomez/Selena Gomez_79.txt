Lyrics From Snippets
[Verse]
You don't have to mention one of me is wreckless
I can take your breath away and leave you with my essence
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you wanna feel me
Understand you don’t have to feel guilty, no
I don't blame ya
'Cause I wanna scream and shout
[Chorus]
I feel pretty, oh so pretty
Just might be the prettiest one in the city
I feel pretty, and I'm witty, and I'm so so bright
I feel pretty, oh so pretty
Just might be the prettiest one in the city
And I pity any girl who isn’t me tonight
