[Verse 1]
You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for,
no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to
[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh
[Verse 2]
You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up that bad kind of love
Is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah, you had your way
I'm trying to pull myself together
[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh
[Bridge]
Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
[Chorus]
Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh
