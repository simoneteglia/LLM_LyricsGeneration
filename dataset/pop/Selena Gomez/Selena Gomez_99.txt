[Verse 1]
You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
'Cause you're never gonna take me there
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be
[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head (Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
[Verse 2]
Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors, but you won't come clean
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know what I know
And I know it's not meant to be
[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma:
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you outta my head (Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
[Bridge]
One day I want ya, and then I don't
I'm gonna leave you, and then I won't
I can't live, live with or without ya
I can't live, live with or without ya
[Chorus]
Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma from the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head (Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, It's you, it's you (It's you, it's you)
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you (It's you)
It's you, it's you, it's you (My-my-my dilemma)
