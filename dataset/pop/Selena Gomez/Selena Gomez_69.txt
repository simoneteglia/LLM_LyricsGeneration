[Intro]
It doesn't hurt like before, no
The wound of your love healed
[Chorus]
Once and for all, ah-ah-ah
I'm stronger alone, ah-ah-ah (I'm stronger alone)
And I do not regret the past
I know that the time by your side cut my wings
But now this chest is bulletproof
[Verse]
I don't have you, I have myself
It's not for you to think that this is for you, nah
I left so that you don't forget
From death like you, one can be revived
When the last sea dries up
Is when I will think of returning
You have understood what I feel
You are no longer here, how good a time I'm having
I'm cured of you, I already told you
I no longer feel you here, I don't feel you anymore
You never knew, you never knew how to value me, andâ€” (Oh)
[Chorus]
Once and for all (Once and for all), ah-ah-ah
I'm stronger alone, ah-ah-ah
And it's just that I do not regret the past
I know that the time by your side cut my wings (Ah-ah)
But now this chest is bulletproof
[Outro]
Oh
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
This chest is bulletproof
Uh-uh-uh-uh
Alone, ah-ah, ah
Now this chest is bulletproof
