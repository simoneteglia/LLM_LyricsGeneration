[Verse 1]
How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell it comes naturally
It comes naturally
You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally
Mm, it comes naturally
[Pre-Chorus]
And it takes my breath away
What you do so naturally
[Chorus]
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby
[Verse 2]
You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally (You know it does)
It comes naturally (Mmm, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
And it takes my breath away (Every time)
What you do so naturally
[Chorus]
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby
[Bridge]
When we collide, sparks fly
When you look in my eyes
It takes my breath away
You are
[Chorus]
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me, it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby
[Outro]
(Naturally) Naturally (Naturally), naturally (Naturally)
Ba-ba-baby
(Naturally) Naturally (Naturally), naturally (Naturally)
Everything, baby, comes naturally
Naturally, naturally, everything, baby, comes naturally
