[Verse 1]
This is just what the doctor ordered (Yeah)
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah, we've talked around every corner
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry
I'm a sensitive situation (Mmm)
You're a hot and cold combination
Oh, we both know we got complications (Mmm)
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)
[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
Can we keep it on a first name basis? (Ah)
We could overcrowd each other's spaces
You get me higher than my medication
Take me to different places, let's face it, I'm gettin' impatient (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)
[Chorus]
Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun (Mmm, ow)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
You look like
You don't, but you know how
Like a
beautiful breakdown
And it's just not right, but you look like
You don't, but you know how
Make me wanna slow down
And it's just not right that you look like
[Outro]
Fun (Yeah, ow)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun
