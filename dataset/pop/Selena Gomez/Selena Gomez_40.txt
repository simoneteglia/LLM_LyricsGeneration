[Verse 1]
Like a prayer surroundin' us, movin' effortlessly
Every word is relief
I'm in dance floor therapy, all my babies and me
But tonight, it's for free
No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once
[Pre-Chorus]
I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects (
Ooh
)
[Chorus]
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (
Ooh
)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (
Ooh
)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out
[Verse 2]
Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark, I'm letting go, so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free
[Pre-Chorus]
I need to let my mind rest (My, my mind)
While my body reflects (
Ooh
)
[Chorus]
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (
Ooh
)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (
Ooh
)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (
Ooh
)
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (
Ooh
)
I'm good right now (Get up), I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside—
[Bridge]
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to be free (Ooh)
Oh my, I guess this is what it feels like to see me (Ooh,
down
, ooh)
(Get down) Don't get me, oh (
Down
, oh)
(Get down) Don't get me (
Ooh
)
(Get down) Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out
[Chorus]
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (
Ooh
, I won't let me get me)
Don't get me down (Get up), I won't let me get me (
Ooh
)
I'm good right now (Get up), I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out
