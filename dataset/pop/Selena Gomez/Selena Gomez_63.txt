[Chorus]
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
Tell 'em that it's my birthday, when I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know, so it's okay
Tell 'em that it's my birthday, when I party like that
[Drop]
(
Uh, uh-uh-uh
) Jazz it up
(
Uh, uh-uh-uh

[Verse 1]
Happy as can be
Fallin' into you, fallin' into me (
So yummy

How do you do?
Come and meet the queen
Cake and cream
[Pre-Chorus]
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams
Blow your dreams away with me
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams
Blow your dreams away with me
(
So yummy
)
[Chorus]
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
Tell 'em that it's my birthday, when I party like that
Every night's my birthday
They don't know, so it's okay
Tell 'em that it's my birthday, when I party like that
[Drop]
(
Uh, uh-uh-uh
) Jazz it up
(
Uh, uh-uh-uh

[Verse 2]
Feeling fine and free
Crashing into you, crashing into me (
So yummy

It's all I wanna do
Come and dance with me
Pretty please
[Pre-Chorus]
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams
Blow your dreams away with me
Blow your dreams, blow your dreams
Blow your dreams away with me

Tell 'em that it's my birthday
Tell 'em that it's my birthday
Tell 'em that it's my birthday, when I party like that
