[Verse 1]
I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam, but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious, but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said
[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world
[Post-Chorus]
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name
[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away
[Chorus]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world
[Post-Chorus]
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name
[Refrain]
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
[Post-Chorus]
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name
[Outro]
Forget forever
Forget forever
