[Intro: Rauw Alejandro &
Selena Gomez
]
Baby, I don't know if you speak any Spanish
If you understand when I say "My love"
Making love without understanding each other is better
We just have to like each other
You want me to fall into temptations
Look how that accent
That you have makes me feel
I don't understand too much, but come here
[Chorus: Selena Gomez &
Rauw Alejandro
]
Dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance and I'll follow you
Come closer, come, get loose
Don't leave me without the desire to rеturn
So dance, dance, dance with mе
Dance, dance, I'll follow you
Kiss me just once
So I'll have a reason to see you again (
Rauw
)
[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro &
Selena Gomez
]
Sincerely, let's let this flow
Don't keep thinking about it
We have the whole night for you to show me everything you feel face to face
Smells to me like there's nothing innocent about you (Yah, yah)
How do I tell you I don't want to talk about love?
If it's with you, I have to think better
Chill out, leave it like that, I want to stay here
Come closer, come to me, come closer, come to me
[Chorus: Selena Gomez &
Rauw Alejandro
]
Dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance and I'll follow you
Come closer, come, get loose
Don't leave me without the desire to return
So dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance, I'll follow you
Kiss me just once
So I'll have a reason to see you again (
Yeah!
)
[Verse 2: Rauw Alejandro]
I'm gonna leave you my number
You just have to call when you miss me
I'll be there (Ooh-woo)
Baby, even if I'm far, woah-oh (Yeah!)
The girl's from a different city, but she likes my flow
I was curious and she stole a kiss from me
We don't have to talk to each other (Ayy)
If with just a look we understand each other, yeah (Yeah!)
[Chorus: Selena Gomez &
Rauw Alejandro
,
Both
]
I don't understand a lot, but
dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance, dance and I'll follow you
Come closer, come, get loose
Don't leave me without the desire to return
So
dance, dance, dance with me
Dance, dance, dance, I'll follow you
Kiss me just once
That way I'll have a reason
to see you again
,
eh
[Outro: Rauw Alejandro]
Ra-Rauw, ayy
Rauw Alejandro
With Selena
Tell me, Tainy
