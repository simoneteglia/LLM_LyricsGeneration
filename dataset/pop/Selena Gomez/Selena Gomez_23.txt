[Verse 1]
Should I do it on the phone?
Should I leave a little note
In the pocket of his coat? Yeah
Maybe I'll just disappear
I don't wanna see a tear
And the weekend's almost here
[Chorus]
I'm pickin' out this dress
Tryin' on these shoes
'Cause I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
I know he'll be a mess
When I break the news
But I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
[Post-Chorus]
I'ma date who I wanna
Stay out late if I wanna
I'ma do what I wanna do
I'm pickin' out this dress
Tryin' on these shoes
'Causе I'll be single soon
I'll be singlе soon
[Verse 2]
I know I'm a little high
Maintenance, but I'm worth a try
Might not give a reason why (Oh well)
We both had a lot of fun
Time to find
another one
Blame it all on feelin' young
[Chorus]
I'm pickin' out this dress
Tryin' on these shoes
'Cause I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
I know he'll be a mess
When I break the news
But I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
[Post-Chorus]
I'ma date who I wanna
Stay out late if I wanna
I'ma do what I wanna do
I'm pickin' out this dress
Tryin' on these shoes
'Cause I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll be single soon (Hah-ah)
Yeah, I'll be single soon
Yeah, I'll be single soon (Hah-ah)
Yeah, I'll be single soon
[Chorus]
I'm pickin' out this dress
Tryin' on these shoes
'Cause I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
I know he'll be a mess
When I break the news
But I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
[Post-Chorus]
I'ma date who I wanna
Stay out late if I wanna
I'ma do what I wanna do
I'm pickin' out this dress
Tryin' on these shoes
'Cause I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
[Outro]
Well, who's next?
