[Verse 1]
Take my arm, take my head
Make your mark like a man
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Hurts so good, love and pain
When all fades, you remain
Write your name
Gonna write your name
[Chorus]
Write your name across my heart
Write your name over every part
And we could be worlds apart
Write your name across my heart
[Post-Chorus]
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name
[Verse 2]
Permanent, leave your scar
When you're gone, you're never far
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Cover me, all you are
Over me, your signature
Write your name, gonna write your name
[Chorus]
Write your name across my heart
Write your name over every part
And we could be worlds apart
Write your name across my heart
[Bridge]
It's your name across my heart
Written in gold, a permanent mark
Love engraved, it's what we are
More than words, this love is art
Poetry in motion, put it right there
Deeper than skin, crystal clear
Letters don't fade, titanium made
Forever here, forever saved
[Breakdown]
Write your name, across my heart
[Chorus]
Write your name across my heart
Write your name over every part
And we could be worlds apart
Write your name across my heart
[Post-Chorus]
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name
