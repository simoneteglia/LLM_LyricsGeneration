[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I can't seem to hide from the lies
I can't disguise myself
I've build these walls so high
And I can't climb myself
[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love
[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I can't seem to choose what to do
There's nothing I can say
I'm tired of the fight 'cause I'm never right
I just wanna cry, no
[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love
[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
When the world is yours
Then it's mine's and it's yours
And the sunset's ours
I can tell that it's yours [?]
When the world is yours
Then it's mine's and it's yours
And the sunset's ours
I can tell that it's yours [?]
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love
(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love
