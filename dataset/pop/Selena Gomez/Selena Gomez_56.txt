[Chorus]
Now's all we got
And time can't be bought
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
[Verse 1]
You said you loved me, I said I loved you back
What happened to that? What happened to that?
All your promises and all them plans we had
What happened to that? What happened to that?
[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget
[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember (Love)
Love will remember, love will remember (Oh)
Love will remember (Oh), love will remember
[Verse 2]
The trips we dreamed of taking, the tacks left on the map
What happened to that? What happened to that?
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh
What happened, what happened, what happened to that?
[Pre-Chorus]
Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget
[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember (Love)
Love will remember, love will remember (Oh)
Love will remember (Oh), love will remember (Love)
Love will remember, love will remember (Oh)
Love will remember (Oh), love will remember
[Bridge]
Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again (Love)
We used to be inseparable (Oh)
I used to think that I was irreplaceable (Oh, love)
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up (Love)
Forever, forever, forever (Oh)
[Chorus]
Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember (Love)
Love will remember, love will remember (Oh)
Love will remember (Oh), love will remember (Love)
Love will remember, love will remember (Oh)
Love will remember (Oh), love will remember
