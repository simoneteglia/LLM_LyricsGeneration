[Verse 1]
It's the boy you never told, "I like you"
It's the girl you let get away
It's the one you saw that day on the train
But you freaked out and walked away
It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
Things you swear you'll do before you die
It's the city of love that waits for you
But you're too damn scared to fly
[Chorus]
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight
[Verse 2]
It's the time that you totally screwed up
Still, you're tryna get it out your brain
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up
It's the past that you're dying to change
It's all the money that you're savin'
While the good life passes by
It's all the dreams that never came true
'Cause you're too damn scared to try
[Chorus]
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight
[Refrain]
It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world when you go all the way
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
[Bridge]
So let's go, go, go, go all the way
Yeah, let's go, go, go, go night and day
From the floor to the rafters
People, raise your glasses
We could dance forever
[Chorus]
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight (
Lose yourself tonight
)
Come alive
Let the moment take you
Lose control tonight
[Refrain]
It's a mad, mad world, gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world when you go all the way
Hit the lights
Let the music move you
Lose yourself tonight
