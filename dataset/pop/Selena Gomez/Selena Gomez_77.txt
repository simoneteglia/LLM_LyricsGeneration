[Verse 1]
I look at you and all I wanna do is just disappear (
Oh, ooh
)
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get outta here? (
Oh, ooh
)
[Pre-Chorus]
You're a sexy machine
You're a Hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd
Somewhere no one's allowed
I want you
[Chorus]
All to myself
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows
And pull the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
[Verse 2]
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark (
Oh
)
And you can navigate me like a map that you know by heart (
Oh
)
[Pre-Chorus]
You're a sexy machine
You're a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd
Somewhere no one's allowed
I want you
[Chorus]
All to myself
I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows
And pull the shades down until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows, yeah
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
[Verse 2]
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can navigate me like the map that you know by heart
[Breakdown]
All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah
You don't need no other lover
You don't need no other lover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it
undercover
[Outro]
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
