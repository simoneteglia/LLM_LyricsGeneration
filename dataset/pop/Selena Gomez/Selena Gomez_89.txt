[Verse 1]
You're my bad boy fairytale
Prince Charming, with a dark side
I wanna be your bad girl
You bring out my wild side
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your eyes, your lips, your touch
This toxic, twisted rush
Your sexy kinda swag
The best I've ever had
[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does it like you
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up
But I'm loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does...
[Post-Chorus]
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
No, I can't go back
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
No, I can't go back
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
[Verse 2]
You're my bad boy fairytale
My rebel with a halo
You hit me like a hurricane
And I can never say no
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your mind, your hands, your voice
The way you make me yours
Your sexy kinda swag
The best I've ever had
[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does it like you
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up
But I'm loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does...
[Post-Chorus]
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
No, I can't go back
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
No, I can't go back
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
[Bridge]
I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my wild side
I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my dark side
[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does it like you
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does it like you
You got me feeling so caught up
But I'm loving all the crazy things you make me do
Nobody, nobody, no-nobody, nobody
Nobody does...
[Post-Chorus]
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
No, I can't go back
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
No, I can't go back
No, I can't go back to the way it was
To the way it was
[Outro]
I wanna be a bad girl
You bring out my wild side
