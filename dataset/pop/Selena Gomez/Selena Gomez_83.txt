[Verse 1]
Turned my back to the door
Feel so much better now
Don't even try anymore
Nothing left to lose
There's a voice that's in the air
Saying don't look back nowhere
There's a voice that's always there
[Verse 2]
And I'll never be quite the same as I was before
This part of you still remains
Though it's out of focus
You're just somewhere that I've been
And I won't go back again
You're just somewhere that I've been
[Chorus]
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life, crazy loud, like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
[Verse 3]
And I'll never be like I was the day I met you
Too naive, yes, I was
Boy, that's why I let you in
Wear your memory like a stain
Can't erase or numb the pain
Here to stay with me forever
[Chorus]
Breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life, crazy loud, like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
[Bridge]
One of these days, I'll wake up from this bad dream I'm dreaming
One of these days, I'll pray that I'll be over, over, over you
One of these days, I'll realize that I'm so tired of feeling confused
But for now, there's a reason that you're still here in my heart
[Chorus]
I'm breathing in, breathing out
Ain't that what it's all about?
Living life, crazy loud, like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left for me to doubt
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
[Outro]
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in, breathing out
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth, nothing left to figure out
But I don't think I'll ever break through
The ghost of you
