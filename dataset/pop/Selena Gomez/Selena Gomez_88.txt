[Intro]
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
[Verse 1]
Tonight, we come alive
Stand up, 'cause you got that pride
Dancing, and the sweat don't dry
One shot, so baby, hit it right
No doubt, 'cause we're young and free
Walk like you run the city
Write your name in the sky
Live it up, 'cause baby, it's your time
[Pre-Chorus]
It's in the way you hold yourself
You gotta know you're something else
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy
[Chorus]
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
[Verse 2]
We got nothing to lose
We got nothing to prove
Shine like diamonds in the sky
Live it up, 'cause baby, it's your time
[Pre-Chorus]
It's in the way you hold yourself
You gotta know you're something else
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy
[Chorus]
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
[Refrain]
Bi-di-bom-bi-di-bom-bi-di-bay
Bi-di-bi-di-bi-di-bi-di-bom-bi-di-bay
Bi-di-bom-bi-di-bom-bi-di-bay
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
[Bridge]
Stand up, let 'em know that you shine bright
Throw down, let 'em know that you got fight
Walk like a champion, walk like a champion
Stand up, let 'em know that you shine bright
Throw down, let 'em know that you got fight
And show 'em that you've never felt so sexy, sexy, sexy
[Chorus]
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion (Woah-oh)
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Ram-pa-pa-pam-pam, ram-pa-pa-pam-pam

Bi-di-bom-bi-di-bom-bi-di-bay
Walk like a champion, talk like a champion
