[Verse 1]
Wanna hear a part to my story? I tried to hide in the glory
And sweep it under the table so you would never know
Sometimes I feel like an accident, people look when they're passin' it
Never check on the passenger, they just want the free show
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm constantly
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see
[Chorus]
My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now
If somеbody sees me like this, then thеy won't feel alone now
My mind and me
[Verse 2]
It's hard to talk and feel heard when you always feel like a burden
Don't wanna add to concern I know they already got
But if I pull back the curtain, then maybe someone who's hurtin'
Will be a little more certain they're not the only one lost
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm constantly
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see
[Chorus]
My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now
If somebody sees me like this, then they won't feel alone now
[Outro]
My mind and me (Ah, ah, ah)
My mind and me (Ah, ah, ah)
My mind, my mind
My mind and me (Ah, ah, ah)
My mind and me (Ah, ah, ah)
Oh, it's only my mind and me
My mind and me
