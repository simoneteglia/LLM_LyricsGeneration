[Verse 1: Trevor Daniel &
Selena Gomez
]
I'm trying to be honest with my happiness
Don't know why I'm bad at this, uh
And I don't wanna sit in all my sadness
I know it's a habit of mine
[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez &
Trevor Daniel
]
Perfect, perfect timing
I start what I don't know how to end
Don't re-, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, oh
[Chorus: Selena Gomez
with Trevor Daniel
]
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you, only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last time, was the last time,
woah
[Verse 2: Trevor Daniel &
Selena Gomez
]
Gave me what I wanted when I needed it
Honestly, I mean it
And if I could convince myself to feel it
You know I would feel it, I would
[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez &
Trevor Daniel
]
Perfect, perfect timing
I start what I don't know how to end
Don't re-, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, oh
[Chorus: Trevor Daniel
with Selena Gomez
]
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I'll never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you, only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last night of my past life,
woah
[Post-Chorus: Trevor Daniel]
Oh, woah, woah, woah
Oh, woah, woah, woah
[Chorus: Selena Gomez
with Trevor Daniel
]
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you, only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last night of my past life, woah
[Post-Chorus: Trevor Daniel & Selena Gomez,
Selena Gomez
]
Oh, woah, woah, woah
Oh, woah, woah, woah
(Oh)
Where we've been
What we know
(Woah, woah, woah)
Will never go away (Oh)
Will never go away
(Woah, woah, woah)
[Outro: Trevor Daniel &
Selena Gomez
]
Where we've been
What we know
Will never go away
Will never go away
