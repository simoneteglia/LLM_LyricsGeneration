[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh, wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room, there's a king-size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want, you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh, every time I watch you
serpentine
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no, not to think about you
Oh, no, no, no, no
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
[Verse 2]
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear, oh-oh
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind (Of my mind)
Ooh, every time I watch you serpentine
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you (Not to think about you)
No, no, no, no, not to think about you (Not to think about you)
Oh, no, no, no, no
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you (Not to give in to you)
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (Not to give in to you, oh)
[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
[Bridge]
And oh, baby, let's make reality actuality, a reality
Oh, baby, let's make reality actuality, a reality (Oh)
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you (Think about you)
No, no, no, no, not to think about you (Think about you)
Oh, no, no, no, no
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you (Not to give in to you)
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (Not to give in to you, oh)
[Post-Chorus]
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
