Snippet
[Intro: Selena Gomez]
(Yeah, here, you're here, you're here
Higher, higher, higher, higher)
[Verse: Selena Gomez &
Halsey
]
Heaven in the valley, in the valley
Baby, it's higher, we did a
Hundred going into the night
And every day, you make a
Promise It'll be better in time
Can you tell me?
How long, how long do I gotta
Wait on, wait on?
'Cause my time, my time is running out
[Outro: Selena Gomez &
Halsey
]
I've been in the valley, in the valley
Baby, it's higher, we did a
Hundred going into the night
And every day, you make a
Promise It'll be better in time
Can you tell me?
How long, how long do I gotta
Wait on, wait on?
'Cause my time, my time is running out
