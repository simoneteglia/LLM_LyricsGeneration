[Intro]
La-la-la, la-ah, ah-ah-ah, la-ah
La-la-la, la-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
[Verse 1]
Your friends already told me
That you don't want to know about me
You don't miss the routine anymore
That your life is better without me
[Pre-Chorus]
But then, why do you claim me?
Asking me how and with whom
If you call me at three in the morning
That I've already forgotten you
Bye
[Chorus]
This is not for you
The picture I posted, I wanted to tell you, yeah, "Bye"
It's fine, it's not ill-intentioned
This is not personal, there's nothing to explain, goodbye
If they say out there that's who I saw
I probably did, yeah, bye
Calm down, calm down, bye
I've said goodbye
[Verse 2]
Because there's nothing left here
You've got me wrong
No, don't drown me with words
If I leave you on seen, why do you call me?
No, no, don't play dumb
If I got you low, low
It's because I don't want drama anymore
I want to go to bed with whoever I want
[Pre-Chorus]
But then, why do you claim me?
Asking me how and with whom
If you call me at three in the morning
I already forgot you
Bye
[Chorus]
This is not for you
The picture I posted, I wanted to tell you, yeah, "Bye"
It's fine, it's not ill-intentioned
This is not personal, there's nothing to explain, goodbye
If they say out there that's who I saw
I probably did, yeah, bye
Calm down, calm down, bye
I've said goodbye
[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
Bye (Yeah)
La-la-la, la-ah, ah-ah-ah, la-ah
La-la-la, la-ah, ah-ah-ah, la-ah
Bye
