[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
It started polite, out on thin ice
'Til you came over to break it
I threw you a line and you were mine
Yeah, I was afraid, but you made it safe
I guess that is our combination
Said you feel lost, well, so do I
[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same 'cause
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
Engulfed in the flames, engulfed in the shame
Betrayed by your imagination
In over my head, but that's alright
[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
So won't you call me in the morning?
I think that you should call me in the morning
If you feel the same 'cause
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room (Oh)
Baby, it's just me and you
[Bridge]
The world keeps on spinning, but I ain't dizzy yet, yeah
The more that you give, give, give, give, the more that you get
[Verse 3: 6LACK]
It's just us two in the crowd, we feel alone
I turn every chair that you sit in into a throne
Not too many of 'em put it down like me
I say it humbly, but they don't wear the crown like me
It's all in your eyes, locked, loaded, we were rolling
You make the whole room feel slow-motion
You make me feel like I'm drowning in a potion
Closed off, tryna get a little open
The more that I give, the more that I get
So baby, I'ma call you in the AM
You're down for my love, honey, say when
I be waitin' on my time 'cause I'm patient
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
Baby, it's just me and you
Baby, it's just me and you
Just us two
Even in a crowded room
Baby, it's just me and you, yeah
