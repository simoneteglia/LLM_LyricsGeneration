[Verse 1]
Pull up to the mirror, staring at my face
Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've been carrying for fourteen-hundred-sixty days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate
[Pre-Chorus]
And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messin' with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love?
[Chorus]
So I gotta get
You out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You out my head now
I just cut you off
[Verse 2]
I imagine all the endless places I could know
If I drop-drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I got from head to toe
Yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd start to show
[Pre-Chorus]
And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough (Had enough)
Emotionally messin' with my health, ha
How could I confuse that shit for love?
[Chorus]
So I gotta get
You out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You out my head now
I just (I just), I just
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
You out my head now (I just)
When I'm without
You out my head now
[Chorus]
So I gotta get
You out my head now
I just (I just) cut you off (Yeah, I cut you off)
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You out my head now
I just, I just, yeah
