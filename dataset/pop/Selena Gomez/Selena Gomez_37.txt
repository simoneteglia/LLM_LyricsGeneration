[Intro]
Everything
Is not
What it seems
[Verse 1]
Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze
The end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
Yes, please
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you never read
With a snap of your fingers, you can make your bed
And that's what I said
[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
[Verse 2]
There's always lot of people that you need to see
But you got a quick way to get from A to B
Just be careful who's aware of your reality
You'll know what I mean
There's a whole other world that you'll only know
When you can make yourself invisible from head-to-toe
But understand, that's not the status quo (Oh)
Careful what you show
[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems (Oh)
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems
[Bridge]
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Uh-oh, things are gettin' kinda tricky
But it doesn't mean much to a girl like me
'Cause I could do the things you'd never believe
Even in your wildest dreams
Well, excuse me, I know it's strange, but true
In my opinion, from my point of view
That once in a blue moon, I don't know what to do
It's like a catch twenty-two
[Chorus]
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems (Oh)
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems (Oh)
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not
What it seems
