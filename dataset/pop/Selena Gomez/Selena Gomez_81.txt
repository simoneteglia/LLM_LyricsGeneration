[Verse 1]
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
See, we don't have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with
[Chorus]
And kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead now
(Mm)
[Verse 2]
We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Every day a small piece of you dies
There's always somebody
You're willing to fight, to be right
[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
No war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting
[Chorus]
Please, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead now
(Mm-mm)
[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun
No war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Why can't we stop fighting?
[Chorus]
And kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead now
[Outro]
Ah, oh yeah
(Mm-mm, mm)
(Mm-mm, mm-mm)
