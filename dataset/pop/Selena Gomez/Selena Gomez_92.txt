[Intro: Demi Lovato]
Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la
Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la
[Verse 1: Selena Gomez,
Demi Lovato
]
You come from here, I come from there
You rock out in your room, I rock a world premiere
We're more alike than anybody could ever tell
Friday we're cool, Monday we're freaks
Sometimes we rule, sometimes we can't even speak
But we kick it up, let loose and LOL
(
LOL
)
[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez,
Demi Lovato
]
It may seem cliché for me to wanna say that you're not alone (that you're not alone)
And you can call me uncool, but it's a simple fact
I got your back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus 1: Demi Lovato & Selena Gomez]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream
We're one and the same
Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la
[Verse 2: Demi Lovato,
Selena Gomez
]
I'm kinda like you, you're kinda like me
We write the same song in a different key
It's got a rhythm, you and me can get along
[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez,
Demi Lovato
]
And it may seem cliché for me to wanna say that you're not alone (
Here I go again
)
And you can call me uncool, but it's a simple fact
I still got your back
(I still got your back)
[Chorus 2: Demi Lovato & Selena Gomez]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
I think we're almost legendary
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one and the same
[Bridge: Selena Gomez,
Demi Lovato
]
'Cause we're one and the same
We're anything but ordinary
One and the same
We're something more than momentary
[Breakdown: Selena Gomez,
Demi Lovato
]
'Cause we're one
'Cause we're one (We're almost legendary)
We're anything but ordinary
[Chorus 3: Demi Lovato & Selena Gomez]
You and me, the perfect team
Chasing down the dream, oh
You and me, the perfect team
Shaking up the scene
We're one and the same
[Outro: Demi Lovato]
Hey, hey, hey!
La, la, la, la, la
Hey, hey, hey!
