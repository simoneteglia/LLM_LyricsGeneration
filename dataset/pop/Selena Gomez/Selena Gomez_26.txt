[Verse 1]
Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving further away
Want you near me
[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you (
Only you, only you
)
[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you
[Chorus]
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you (
Only you, only you, only you, only you
)
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Only you
Only you
Only you
Only you
[Verse 3]
This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door
[Chorus]
And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you (
Only you, only you, only you
)
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you (
Only you, only you, only you
)
[Outro]
Only
Only you
