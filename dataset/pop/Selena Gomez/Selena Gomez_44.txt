[Verse 1]
Hey, you started out sweeter than hard candy
Words were like licorice to the taste
But slowly, all the sugar, it went to waste
Went to waste
Oh, you started getting funny with no jokes
I started seein' through you like a ghost
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more-ore
[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Hey, you're the one who started talkin' to me
Made the move, asked me to be your babe
And now you're treatin' me like I'm insane
You're insane
[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
[Bridge]
Hey
Hey, hey (Hey, yeah)
Hey (Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey)
Hey, hey (Hey, yeah, hey, yeah)
[Chorus]
I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (You're kind of crazy)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (You're kind of crazy)
[Outro]
Hmm, I don't know
