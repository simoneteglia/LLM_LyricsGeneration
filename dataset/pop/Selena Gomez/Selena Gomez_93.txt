[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
[Verse 1]
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so (Ow!)
[Verse 2]
I love a sunny day
I dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so (Ow!)
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, it's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so, oh
[Outro]
Never believe
