[Verse 1]
You were runnin' through me like water
Now the feeling's leavin' me dry
These days, we couldn't be farther
So how’s it feel to be on the other side?
[Pre-Chorus]
So many wasted (
Wasted
)
Nights with (
Nights with
) you (You)
I still can taste it (
Taste it
)
I hate it, wish I could take it back 'cause
[Chorus]
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
[Verse 2]
When it was good, we were on fire
Now I'm breathin' ashes and dust
I always wanna get higher
I never know when enough is enough
[Pre-Chorus]
So many wasted (
Wasted
)
Nights with (
Nights with
) you (You)
I still can taste it (
Taste it
)
I hate it, wish I could take it back 'cause
[Chorus]
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
[Post-Chorus]
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-da-dum
People you don't
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-da-dum
People you don't (Ooh)
From people you know to people you don't (Ooh)
From people you know to people you don't
[Chorus]
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
From people you know to people you don't
[Post-Chorus]
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum (Ooh)
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-dum
From people you know to people you don't
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum (Ooh)
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-dum
From people you know to people you don't
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum (Ooh)
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-dum
From people you know to people you don't
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum (Ooh)
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-dum
From people you know to people you don't
