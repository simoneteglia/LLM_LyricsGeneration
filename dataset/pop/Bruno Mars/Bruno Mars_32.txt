[Intro: Damian Marley]
Now greetings to da world (All of you)
Voice of da one called Bruno Mars, 'long side gong to da zilla
(Ya know I mean? I roll)
[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Me and my guitar, tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna leave with more than what I got
'Cause sixty-eight cent just ain't gon' pay the rent
So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
Here come Junior Gong
I'm flying high like Superman
And thinking that I run the whole block
I don't know if it's just because
Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to de cops
And stand up to de bigga heads
Becaw de whole ah de mah saps
All de talk dem a talk
And dem fly make nah drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape de trap
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
[Outro Spoken: Damian Marley]
