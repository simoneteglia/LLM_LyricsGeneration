[Part I: Long Tall Sally]
[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
One! Two!
One! Two!
One, two, three, four!
[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John
He claim he has the misery but he has a lot of fun
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, baby
Yeah, baby
Woo-hoo, baby
I'm having me some fun tonight, yeah
[Verse 2]
Well, long tall Sally, she bittersweet
She got everything that Uncle John need
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, baby
Yeah, baby
Woo-hoo, baby
I'm having me some fun tonight, c'mon!
[Part II: Good Golly Miss Molly]
[Intro: Bruno Mars]
Good golly, Miss Molly, you sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, you sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a-rollin'
I can't hear your mama call
[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
From the early, early morning
To the early, early night
When she caught her baby
Comin' in the House of Blue Lights
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Good golly, Miss Molly, you sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a-rollin'
I can't hear your mama call, oww!
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Goin' to the corner
Gonna buy a diamond ring
Would she help me and a-kiss me?
Baby, ting-a-ling-a-ling
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Good golly, Miss Molly, you sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a-rollin'
I can't hear your mama call
[Outro: Bruno Mars]
We love you, Little Richard!
