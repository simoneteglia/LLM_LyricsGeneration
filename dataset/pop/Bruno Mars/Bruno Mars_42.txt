[Verse 1]
Hello
You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kiss my lips, you know, I start to feel wonderful
It's somethin' incredible
There's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
[Chorus]
Oh, moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
[Verse 2]
I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around, they notice that I'm not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
On top of the world (Uh)
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
[Chorus]
Oh, moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Oh, moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
[Bridge]
Don't look down, no, don't never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone
[Chorus]
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Oh, moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
