[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Baby, here we are again
Ooh
[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you want a good time
You wanna put your body on mine
Alright, but don't change your mind, don't you change it, oh, no
Oh, yeah, you called me today, drove all this way
So don't let this buzz go to waste, oh, no
Girl, Pleasure, Pleasure Island is where we can go
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes sayin' "please me" but your lips scared to ask
No need to fight it when you know it feels right
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes
[Chorus]
Then show me
You got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
Well, show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me
You got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
Well, show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
[Verse 2]
Love the way that you laugh, the way that you smile
Makes me feel like you've been waitin' a while
Well, guess what, darlin', I've been waiting too
So let's grind
We can get freaky tonight
Right here's your ticket to ride
Tell me, girl, what you gon' do?
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes sayin' "please me" but your lips scared to ask
No need to fight it when you know it feels right
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes
[Chorus]
Then show me
You got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
Well, show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me
You got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
Well, show me, show me, show me tonight, uh
[Bridge]
It's gettin' freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh
It's gettin' freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh
[Chorus]
Then show me
You got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
Well, show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me
You got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
Well, show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
