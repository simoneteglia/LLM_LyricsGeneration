[Verse 1]
Ooh, don't we look good
Together? (Together, together)
There's a reason why they watch all night
Long (All night long, woo!)
Yeah, I know we'll turn heads
Forever (Forever, forever)
So tonight, I'm gonna show
You off
[Pre-Chorus]
When I walk in witchu (When I walk in witchu)
I watch the whole room change (I watch the whole room change)
Baby, that's what you do (Baby, that's what you do)
No, my baby don't play (No)
Blame it on my confidence
Or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right
[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
[Verse 2]
Now slow it down
For me, baby (Slow it down, girl)
'Cause I love the way it feels
When we grind (When we grind,) yeah-eah
Our connection's so
Magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
When I walk in witchu (When I walk in witchu)
I watch the whole room change (I watch the whole room change)
Baby, that's what you do (Baby, that's what you do)
No, my baby don't play (No)
Blame it on my confidence
Or blame it on your measurements
Shut the shit down on sight
That's right
[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it (Woo!)
[Bridge]
Fellas, grab your ladies if
Your lady fine
Tell her she the one
She the one for life
Ladies, grab your fellas, and
Let's do this right (Do this right)
If you're on one like me in mind
(Woo!)
[Refrain]
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? Ayy
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Girl, we got it goin' on
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (He-hey)
Don't it feel so good to be us, ayy? (It feels so good with)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (You)
[Chorus]
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know
We out here drippin' in finesse with my baby
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it (Girl, you know we got it goin' on)
[Refrain]
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on
Don't it feel so good to be us? Ayy
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on

Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (Ooh, girl, we got it)
Don't it feel so good to be us? Ayy (Baby)
Yeah, we got it goin' on, got it goin' on (Woo!)
(You know it, you know it)
