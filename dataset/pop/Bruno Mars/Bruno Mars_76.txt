[Verse 1]
I don't recognize my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me
[Chorus]
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run
[Verse 2]
Wipe those tears from your eyes; it's too late
With that rag in your mouth, can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me
[Chorus]
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run
[Bridge]
You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch now shut up and take it
Look at the monster you created
You brought this up on yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch so shut up and take it
Now I’m a monster, monster you created
Yeah
Killer on the run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
[Chorus]
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run...
[Outro]
Goodbye
[Click-clack]
