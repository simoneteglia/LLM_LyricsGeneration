[Intro: Bootsy Collins]
Wait a minute, this love started out so tender, so sweet
But now she got me
smokin' out the window
Mm, mm, mm
[Verse 1: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's (
Oh no
)
Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib
Like it's Chuck E. Cheese (
Woah, woah
)
Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC
Can't believe it (Can't believe it)
I'm in disbelief
[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak &
Bruno Mars
]
This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists
And here I am all alone (
All alone
)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
You got me out here
[Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Smokin' out the window (
Smokin' out the window
)
Singin', "How could she do this to me?"
(
How could she do this to me?
)
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (
Mmm
)
But I was wrong
'Cause she belong
To everybody, everybody, ooh
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight
Screamin', "Hercules" (Hercules, Hercules)
Got me in the club lookin' for a new love
Someone help me, please (Help me, please, help me, please)
Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl?
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists
And here I am all alone (All alone)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
You got me out here
[Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Smokin' out the window (
Smokin' out the window of the Benzo, the Benzo
)
Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (
How? How could she do this?
)
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (
One thing's for sure, one thing's for sure
)
But I was wrong (
I was wrong
)
'Cause she belong (
She belong
)
To everybody, everybody (
Yeah, she belong to everybody
)
(
That girl, yes, she belong to everybody
) Ooh
[Interlude: Anderson .Paak]
(Oh no)
Look here, baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need
But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets
Look out
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me
Now I gotta give you back (Gotta give you back)
To the city, oh, you got me
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Smokin' out the window (Ooh)
Singin', "How could she do this to me?" (How could you?)
(How could you do this, baby?)
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me (Woo-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo)
But I was wrong (I was wrong)
'Cause she belong (She belong)
To everybody, everybody (Yeah, she belong to everybody)
(Yeah, yeah, she belong to everybody) Ooh
