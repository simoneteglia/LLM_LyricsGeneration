[Chorus]
It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
[Verse 1]
Well,
I know this little chapel on the boulevard, we can go
No one will know
Oh, come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed? Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of Patr√≥n
And it's on, girl
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready
[Chorus]
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
Oh
[Verse 2]
I'll go get a ring, let the choir bells sing like, "Ooh"
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run, girl
If we wake up and you wanna break up, that's cool
No, I won't blame you
It was fun, girl
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no, no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready
[Chorus]
'Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
[Bridge]
Just say, "I do"
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby
Just say, "I do"
Tell me right now, baby
Tell me right now, baby, baby, oh
[Chorus]
It's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey, baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares, baby? I think I wanna marry you
