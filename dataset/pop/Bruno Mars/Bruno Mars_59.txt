[Intro: Anderson .Paak,
Bruno Mars
, &
Bootsy Collins
]
Uh, ladies and gentlemen
Non-stop to the top
I bring you the cream of the crop
Silk Sonic!
Hmm-mm-mm-mm
Say baby, say baby, say baby
(Let's ride)
[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak &
Bruno Mars
]
What you doin'? (
What you doin'?
)
Where you at? (
Where you at?
)
Oh, you got plans? (
You got plans
)
Don't say that (
Shut your trap
)
I'm sippin' wine (
Sip, sip
) in a robe (
Drip, drip
)
I look too good (
Look too good
)
To be alone (
Woo, woo
)
My house clean (
House clean
), my pool warm (
Pool warm
)
I just shaved,
smooth like a newborn
Hmm, we should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms
[Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
I'ma leave the door open
(
I'ma leave the door open
)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(
I'ma leave the door open, hopin'
)
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak &
Bruno Mars
]
Ooh, you're so sweet (
So sweet
), so tight (
So tight
)
I won't bite (
Ah-ah
), unless you like (
Unless you like
)
If you smoke (
What you smoke?
), I got that haze (
Purple haze
)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (
Woo
)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me
waitin'
There's so much love we could be making (
Shamone!
)
I'm talking kissing, cuddling
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms
[Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
I'ma leave the door open
(
I'ma leave the door open
)
I'ma leave the door open, girl, oo-ooh
(
I'ma leave the door open, hopin'
)
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through
(Let's go)
[Bridge: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
I need you, baby
)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
I gotta see you, baby
)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
Girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah
)
[Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
(
I'ma leave the door open
)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
(
I'ma leave the door open, hopin'
)
And I'm hopin', hopin'
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through
(Woo!)
[Outro: Bruno Mars,
Anderson .Paak
, &
Both
]
Hmm, I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you
Come on over, I'll adore you
La-la-la-la
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting for you, you
Come on over, baby
I'ma leave the door open for
You (
Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
)
You (
Woo!
)
Thank you
