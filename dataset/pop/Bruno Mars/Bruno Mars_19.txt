[Verse 1]
She got to shake her little something
(Shake her little something)
Ooh, throwin' that thing from left, right, side to side
She got to have her own money
(She got her own money)
Oh, yeah
Shout out to the girls that pay they rent on time
[Pre-Chorus]
If you ain't here to party, take your ass back home
If you getting naughty, baby, here's my phone
Slide with your boy to the bar
Slide with your boy to the car
I've been searchin' everywhere and now here you are
[Chorus]
Ooh, chunky
Lookin' for them girls with the big ol' hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes
(I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I’m tryna recruit
I'm lookin' at you
Yeah, you, baby
[Verse 2]
Now let me hear you say you ready
(I'm ready)
Oh, yeah
Girl, you better have your hair weave strapped on tight
'Cause once we get goin', we rollin'
We'll cha-cha 'til the morning
So just say alright
(Alright)
[Pre-Chorus]
If you ain't here to party, take your ass back home
If you getting naughty, baby, here's my phone
Slide with your boy to the bar
Slide with your boy to the car
I've been searchin' everywhere and now here you are
[Chorus]
Ooh, chunky
Lookin' for them girls with the big ol' hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes
(I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I’m tryna recruit
I'm looking at you
Yeah, you, baby
(Baby, baby, baby)
[Bridge]
Ow, you got what I want
(I got what you want)
Girl, you got what I need
(I got what you need)
37-27-42
Ooh, squeeze all of that into my coupe
Girl, I-I choo-choose you
[Chorus]
Chunky
Lookin' for them girls with the big ol' hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes
(I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I’m tryna recruit, woah
I'm lookin' at you
Yeah, you, baby
Chunky
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lookin' for them girls with the big ol' hoops, hoops
That drop it down in Daisy Dukes
(I wanna get down)
Yeah, them the ones I’m tryna recruit
Hey, I'm looking at you
Yeah, you, baby
(Baby, baby, baby)
