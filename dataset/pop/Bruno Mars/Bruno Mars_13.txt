[Verse 1]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh
[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talkin' back
Yeah, they're talkin' back, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh), oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh), oh-oh
[Chorus]
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
Still tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
Oh
[Outro]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
