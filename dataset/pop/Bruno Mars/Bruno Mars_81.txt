I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl that girl
Every time I came around
She made her body go down
Her physical was so crazy
She could make a blind man see
Ooh
Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl, that girl
I must've seen her beauty at the bar
Under the strobe lights, looking like a star
(Looking like a star, girl)
But everyone started rushing me
Looking through the crowd, shawty left the scene, oh
Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Club closing up, I'm still looking for you
Walked up to the ladies room
No luck, so I'm headed to the DJ booth
Next thing I know
She tell my show, "This ain't you
Looking at you, you wanna take me home
So tonight, I just might put you on"
I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl
I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl that girl
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
