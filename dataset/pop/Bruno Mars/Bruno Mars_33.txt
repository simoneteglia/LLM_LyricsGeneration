[Intro:
Bootsy Collins
& Bruno Mars]
Oh, lookie here, fellas
Take it from your Uncle Bootsy
Ain't no shame beggin' in the rain
Tell her how you really feel
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I could pretend when I'm out with my friends
I ain't thinkin' about you
I could pretend like I ain't in my feelings
But that ain't true, nah (Nah)
When I called you out your name
That was my ego, my pride and pain
I should be a movie star
The way I play the part like everything's okay
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Oh, now I try to be the life of the party
All night, buying shots for everybody
But it's all just an act (Yeah) 'cause I can't have you back (Yeah)
Without you, I've been goin' crazy
[Chorus: Bruno Mars,
Anderson .Paak
&
Both
]
Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile)
Tryna fight these tears from cryin'
But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin'
Tryna put on a smile, smile (Put on a smile)
Ooh, out here smilin' like a fool
When the only thing worth smilin' for
Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for was
You,
you
, you
You, you, you, you, you
You
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
If I could turn back the hands on my Rollie
, you know I would
I would've spent all my time makin' sure that my baby good
I'm tryin' hard to hide the shame
I know I'm playin' a dangerous game
But since you been gone, I ain't been the same
There's only so much a man can fake
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Oh, now I try to be the life of the party
All night, buying shots for everybody
But it's all just an act (Yeah) 'cause I can't have you back (Yeah)
Without you, I've been goin' crazy
[Chorus: Bruno Mars,
Anderson .Paak
&
Both
]
Tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile)
Tryna fight these tears from cryin'
But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin'
Tryna put on a smile, smile (Put on a smile)
Baby, out here smilin' like a fool
When the only thing worth smilin' for
Baby, you're the only thing worth smilin' for
When the only thing worth smilin' for
Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for was
You, you, you
I'm tryna put on a smile (Put on a smile)
Oh-oh, tryna fight these tears from cryin'
But Lord knows I'm dyin' (Put on a smile)
I'm smilin' like a fool
When the only thing worth smilin' for
Baby, you're the only thing worth smilin' for
When the only thing worth smilin' for
Oh, the only thing worth smilin' for was
You,
you
, you
You, you, you, you, you
