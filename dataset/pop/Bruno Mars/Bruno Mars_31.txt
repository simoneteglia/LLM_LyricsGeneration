[Verse 1]
I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well, you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone
[Pre-Chorus]
I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the -eeshas waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be
[Chorus]
I'm callin' all my lovelies (Callin' all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinkin' of me (Since you ain't thinkin' of me)
Oh, look what you're makin' me do
[Verse 2]
Honey pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby
Sendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell? (What the hell?)
Ooh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games
I don't get down like that, tell me where you're at, hit me back
[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, I got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'
All the -eeshas waitin' on me
So why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?
If this is how it's gonna be
[Chorus]
I'm callin' all my lovelies (Callin' all my lovelies)
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Since you ain't thinkin' of me (Since you ain't thinkin' of me)
Oh, look what you're makin' me do
[Bridge]
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this lovin' needs a home, oh, yeah
Oh, no, look at what you started, baby
Now, I'm left here brokenhearted, baby
There's a pain in my chest, I cannot explain
I told myself I wasn't gon' cry (Oh, not gonna cry, no, no)
But somebody's gotta come dry these eyes 'cause (Dry these,
ah, 'cause
)
[Interlude]
Hi, you've reached Halle Berry. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now
But if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you, mwah
Damn...
[Chorus]
I'm callin', callin', callin', callin' all my lovelies
'Cause I can't get a hold of you
Oh, since you ain't thinkin' of me (Since you ain't thinkin' of me, baby)
Look what you're makin' me do
[Outro]
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
'Cause all this lovin' needs a home, oh
