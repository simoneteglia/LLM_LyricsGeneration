[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
[Verse 1]
Little Ms. Perfect
Sittin' at the train stop
Red Nike high tops
Listenin' to hip-hop
While we were waitin'
Started conversatin'
Before I got her name
Along came a train
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Next stop Brooklyn
Ooh
Now I'm looking
[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
[Verse 2]
On the street kickin' rocks
Circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush
Checkin' every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders
Askin' if they know her
Every dayâ€™s the same
It's back to the train
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Next stop Brooklyn
Ooh
I'm still lookin'
[Chorus]
She was covered in leather and gold
Twenty-one years old
I lost her in the cold
It's unfair, she's out there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I wonder, will we ever meet again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, I wonder, will we ever meet again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I wonder if we'll ever meet again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I hope we do
Somewhere in Brooklyn
