[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feelin' like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now
[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doin'
Look what you've done
But in this jungle, you can't run
'Cause what I got for ya, I promise it's a killer
You'll be bangin' on my chest, bang bang, gorilla
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, makin' love like gorillas
Ooh, ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, makin' love like gorillas
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You just smilin', tell me, "Daddy, it's yours"
'Cause you know how I like it, you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff, call the SWAT
We don't stop, we keep rockin' while they knockin' on our door
And you're screamin', "Give it to me, baby
Give it to me, motherfucker"
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, look what you're doin'
Look what you've done
But in this jungle, you can't run
'Cause what I got for ya, I promise it's a killer
You'll be bangin' on my chest, bang bang, gorilla
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, makin' love like gorillas
Ooh, ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, makin' love like gorillas
[Bridge]
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body tremblin' like it should, it should
You'll never be the same, baby, once I'm done with
You-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
You, you, you
Oh, you and me, baby, makin' love like gorillas
Ooh (Ooh, ooh), ooh, yeah (Yeah)
You and me, baby, we'll be fuckin' like gorillas
Yeah (Ooh), yeah, baby (Ooh), baby (Yeah)
Aw, yeah, yeah
You and me, baby, makin' love like gorillas
