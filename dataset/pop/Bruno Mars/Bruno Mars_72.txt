What are you fucking crazy?
Damn ...
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see
That she do not really know
That I'm trying to find a way
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I. ..
I do not wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
I'm already lost
I wish that I could see
What is making you
Feel that you Should be concerned
My love is like a Gunshot
All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away
I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else
Do you notice me
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous
Should you have by now noticed me
And what will it take it
To a heavenly Because your
Drawing chains and
Driving me insane!
Chorus:
Girl, I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
