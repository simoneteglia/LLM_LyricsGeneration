[Refrain]
Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby
Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby
[Verse 1]
Na-na-na, here we are (Here we are)
In this big old empty room, staring at each other
Who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute
And now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way
Ah-ooh
[Chorus]
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous
'Cause I've got you all night
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (No, no, no)
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
[Verse 2]
Clothes are not required
For what we got planned
Oh, girl, you're my desire
Your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess
Ooh, girl, you're so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day
Gonna eat you before you melt away
[Chorus]
Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl, no need to be nervous (No, no, no, no, oh)
'Cause I've (I've) got (Got) you (You) all night
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (No, no, no)
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
[Refrain]
Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby
Don't it feel good, babe?
Don't it feel good, baby?
'Cause it's so brand new, babe
It's so brand new, baby (Ooh)
[Chorus]
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
