[Intro: Bootsy Collins]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Mm
Damn, I don't even
know who I wa
s last night
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
There's just somethin' about you
(Ooh)
You just made me feel, mm
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Was it good for you?
Ooh, baby
Now, I don't know what you did when you did what you did
But you did it, girl
See, normally, I don't stutter, but you d-d-d-d-do it to me (Silk Sonic)
[Verse 1: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak,
Bootsy Collins
]
Wishin' on a shootin' star, say a prayer for me
And hope it comes true
Ooh-woo-woo-woo (
Ah, yeah
)
Throw my phone out the window, there's no player in me
Those days are through (
Those days are over, baby
)
Ooh-woo-woo-woo (
Uh
)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (
Wait a minute, now
)
[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak &
Bootsy Collins
]
(Ooh) You put it on me like I never felt before
(Ooh) That gushy, gushy good, girl, I want some more
(Ooh) Sweet, sticky,
thick and pretty
You changed the game (
What'd you do?
)
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak,
Bootsy Collins
&
Bruno Mars
]
After
last night
After last night, I think I'm in love with you
(
I think I'm in love with you
)
Woke up and I can't get you out of my head
(
I've tried, I've tried, come on
)
After last night, I don't know what to do
(
Baby, you've got to tell me
)
When I'm gon' see you again
(
Ah,
suki, suki
,
now
)
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak &
Bootsy Collins
]
If I still had my phone, I'd call every girl I know
And tell them goodbye
Ah, bye-bye (
Uh,
toodle-oo
, ooh)
Cars, clothes, diamonds and gold
Anything you want, any place you want
We'll fly, fly, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
(Ooh) You put it on me like I never felt before
(Ooh) That gushy, gushy good, girl, I want some more
(Ooh) Sweet, sticky, thick and pretty
You changed the game
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak,
Bootsy Collins
&
Bruno Mars
]
After last night
After last night (Woo), I think I'm in love with you
(
I think I'm in love with you
)
Woke up and I can't get you out of my head
(
I've tried, I've tried, come on
)
After last night, I don't know what to do
(
Baby, you've got to tell me
)
When I'm gon' see you again
(
Mm, mm, mm
)
(
Sock it to me one more time, come on
)
