[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
One, two, make you wanna, uh
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Now have you ever been with a player?
Take you downtown where they treat me like the mayor
Take you to the crib, we can take it upstairs
"
What's upstairs?
" Shit, I'ma show you later
Don't need a spatula, everything catered, extra flavor
Go 'head, sprinkle some truffle on your mashed potatoes
I'm tryna love, is you gon' love me back?
You only get what you give
, ain't you heard of that?
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Look here
I don't ask for much
You know what I want
I just want what's fair (
Huh
)
I'll bring that fire and desire, baby
All you gotta do is meet me halfway there (Uh)
[Chorus: Both,
Anderson .Paak
&
Bruno Mars
]
I deserve to be
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly
And you deserve to be seen
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly
Oh, don't let 'em trick you with the jibb talk
(
Ow
)
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Uh, okay, now Silk Sonic smooth
like a mack
Float like a butterfly on every single track
And the only language that I speak, girl, is facts
So once I give this game to you, I can't take it back
Hollerin' at you from a
1977 Monte Carlo
, hard act to follow
It's showtime, tryna boo you up like it's the Apollo
Your walk is vicious, let's get down to business
You and me together, ooh, that's somethin' different
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
Ooh, come on
I don't ask for much
I really don't, girl
I just want what's fair
Ha, look here
I'll bring that fire and desire, baby
All you gotta do is this
All you gotta do is meet me halfway there (Uh)
[Chorus: Both,
Anderson .Paak
&
Bruno Mars
]
I deserve to be
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly
And you deserve to be seen
With somebody as fly as me
Somebody this fly
Now for real, I'ma need y'all to understand
