[Intro]
Yeah, ha, The D.E.Y
Yeah, Brandon Creed
[Chorus]
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like you won't come through
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
[Post-Chorus]
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles, c-circles for you
[Verse]
I give you everything, but it's not enough
Used to be easy but lately you've made it rough for us
You say you need me but then turn me away
Got me, oh, so confused, should I leave or should I stay?
[Pre-Chorus]
(Baby, tell me what you want) A little more time
(Baby, tell me what you need) Baby, all your love
(How far you tryna go?) All the way
(Girl, I just don't know) Make up your mind
[Chorus]
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like you won't come through
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
[Post-Chorus]
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles, c-circles for you
[Chorus]
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like you won't come through
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
[Post-Chorus]
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles, c-circles for you
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles, c-circles for you
[Chorus]
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles, c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like you won't come through
Got me going in circles, c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
[Post-Chorus]
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles, c-circles for you
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round we go
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles, c-circles for you
