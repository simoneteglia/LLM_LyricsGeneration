[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And I don't mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it?
'Cause you look like you never been
You're more of a Hell's Angel
And for you, I'd rather sin
Broken heart, love you with a broken heart
For you I'd jump off Noah's arc
Love is blind and hope is dark
Why does pain feel so good?
Love is science live for you
Die for you, and I'll die smiling
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? (Ooh-ooh)
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
(Ooh-ooh) You tossed it in the trash, you did
(Ooh-ooh) To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is I'd catch a
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) throw my hand on a
Blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) I'd jump in front of a
Train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) you know I'd
Do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby, but you won't do the same
[Post-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
No, no, no, no, oh-oh-oh
Uh
[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, "Hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car (Ooh-ooh)
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
(Ooh-ooh) You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did
(Ooh-ooh) To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is
[Hook]
I'd catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you, you know I'd do anything for ya
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby, but you won't do the same
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
[Hook]
But darling
I'd still catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you, you know I'd do anything for ya
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby, but you won't do the same
[Outro]
No you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you wouldn't do the same
No, no, no, no
