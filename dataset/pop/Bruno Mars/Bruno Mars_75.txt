Diamonds on my neck and I don't mean to brag
But I work hard for this money (Hard, hard for this money)
And in case you didn't hear me I work

If you get your own paper, got your own dimes
Buy your own drinks, on your own grind
Then put your hands up, up, up
Ladies, put your hands up, up, up
If you got your own house, got your own car
And you don't need a man to know who you are
Then put your hands up, up, up
Ladies, put your hands up, up, ha

Fresh out the mall in our brand new fits
Going ninety five in our brand new whips
