I just wanna take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right

Put your pinky rings up to the moon

Don't look too hard, might hurt yourself
Known to give the color red the blues
Woo, shit
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they wakin' up the rocket (Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix your face, ain't my fault they all be jockin' (Keep up)
Players only, come on

Bad bitches and your ugly ass friends (Haha)
Can I preach? (Uh-oh) Can I preach? (Uh-oh)

First, take your sip (Sip), do your dip (Dip)
Spend your money like money ain't shit
Ooh-ooh (We too fresh)
Got to blame it on Jesus

They ain't ready for me, uh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (Keep up)
