[Intro]
Ohh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
So easy to forget our love
All of the little things we do
Like calling for no reason
Just to say the words, "Baby, I love you"
I know lately, I've been busy
But a second doesn't go by without you crossing my mind
It's been so long since we had time
Let's take a day and make everything right
[Pre-Chorus]
Just take my hand
Fall in love with me again
[Chorus]
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
[Post-Chorus]
So let's runaway
Let's runaway, just for the day
Runaway, runaway
[Verse 2]
Girl, you've been so patient
Spendin' nights alone and not complaining
But I'll make it up to you
And I promise today I won't keep you waiting
Please give me this one chance
To remind you of everything we have
I won't give up, I'm too much in love
And I want you to know that
[Pre-Chorus]
Just take my hand
Fall in love with me again
[Chorus]
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
[Bridge]
So let's runaway for the day
And I'll give everything in this moment
And I promise to make every day just like the day
Ohh
[Chorus]
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
[Outro]
So let's runaway
