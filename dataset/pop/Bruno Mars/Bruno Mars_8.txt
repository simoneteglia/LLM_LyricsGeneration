[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door
[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain
[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, "There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darling, watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
[Refrain]
And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
If that'll make you mine
[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain
[Bridge]
Oh, don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)
[Refrain]
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
If that'll make it right
[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain
