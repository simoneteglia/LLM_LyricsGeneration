Oh hey sexy its ar'mon and trey
I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hands in my pants
Cause nobody's gon' tell me I can't (No, ha)
I be lounging on the couch
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
[Mark Ronson - Uptown Funk ft. Bruno Mars]
I'm too hot (
goddamn
)
Call the police and the fireman
I'm too hot (goddamn)
I make a dragon wanna retire man
Too hot (goddamn)
Say my name you know who I am
Say my name you know who I am, say my name you know who I am
[Bruno Mars - Treasure]
Treasure, that is what you are
You're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling (Huh)
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're every thing that I see in my dreams
I wouldn't tell you that if it wasn't true
[B.O.B. - Nothing for You ft. Bruno Mars]
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even down there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you know you gonna steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, know you know
[Bruno Mars - Treasure]
Treasure, that is what you are
You're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
