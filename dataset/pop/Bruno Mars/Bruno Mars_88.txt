[Intro]: 24K Magic
Tonight
I just wanna take you higher
Throw your hands up in the sky
Let's set this party off right..
Bands!
Put your pinky rings up - rings up!
[Verse 1]:
Haters keep sneaking and dancing
Put me in the master position (whoo!)
They gon' make me call my bros for assistance (god, damn!)
They gon' make me call my bros for assistance
Haters keep sneaking and dancing
We can't afford mistakes, not on this one
They gon' make me call my bros for assistance
They gon' make me call my bros for assistance
[Verse 2 ]: Privacy
Hey, you girl, with your tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed I'mma lock the door
Shake that ass like
Boom shakalaka
Boom shakalaka
We don't need nobody watching us
No eyes (no eyes) but your eyes (your eyes)
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Licking your private parts
And I know you love your privacy
[Pre-Chorus]: Shape Of You
You know I want your love
Your love was hand-made for somebody like me
So, come on now, follow my lead
Come on now, follow my lead
If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything, then
[Chorus]: 24K Magic
Put your pinky rings up to the moon!
Girls
What ya'll tryna do, (baby what ya tryna do?)
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe, soul playa'!
Look out!
[Hook]:
This one for the hustlas
Gangstas
Bad women and they ugly old friends
Oh can I preach?
(Hallelujah!)
Oh can I preach?
(Go 'head!)
I need to show them how a pimp get it in
First, take your sip
Do your dip
Spend your money like money ain't shit
Blame it on Jesus
Hashtag blessed!
Condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
You and yo' ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
Shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin', yeah (shinin' yeah)
All of this winning I've been losin' my mind, yeah (hold on)
Everywhere I go they be like
(This is how we do it,  la la la la la!)
Everywhere I go they be like
(This is how we do it, nanano, no n-n-no!)
Everywhere I go they be like
(This is how we do it,  la la la!)
Everywhere I go they be like
This is how we do it!
(MUSIC BREAK)
