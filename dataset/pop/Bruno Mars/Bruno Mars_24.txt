[Intro: Unnamed Man &
Bruno Mars
]
Now look at you, been walking in here looking all pretty and angry and mean and good
Now I know you didn't get your hair done so you could just sit down and just sit still
Aye, we tryna have a good time tonight, let's go, baby!
[Verse 1: Bruno Mars and (Backing Vocalists)]
It's my birthday
(No, it's not)
But I still look good, though
(Hot comb hot)
Ow, I bet you want an autograph
(For you and your friends)
Gotta do it in the penthouse
That's where I keep my pen
[Pre-Chorus]
What, you can't dance? Ain't got rhythm?
What, you got a man? I don't see you with him
Put your phone down, let's get it
Forget your Instagram and your Twitter
Got me like woah, wait a minute
You need to take a minute
Loosen them shoulders up
Pour it up, let's work
[Chorus]
Throw some perm on your attitude
Girl, you gotta relax, ooh, uh
Let me show you what you got to do
You gotta lay it back
Matter of fact? Band, show her how to lay it back, uh!
Show her how to lay it back, uh
Show her how to lay it back, aow
Show her how to lay it back
Alright!
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars and (Backing Vocalists)]
Come on, baby, I love you
(No, you don't)
You never know, I might though
Can't say I won't, ah
There's that smile I'm looking for
(Was that so hard?)
Ooh, if you ever need to smile again girl, take my card
[Pre-Chorus]
Razzle-dazzle, never gon' stop
What you want is what I got
You wanna get down? You gotta get up
Don't be stingy with your big ol' butt
You got a booty like
Woah, wait a minute
I'm just playin' with you
Loosen them shoulders up
Pour it up, let's work
[Chorus]
Throw some perm on your attitude
Girl, you gotta relax, ooh, uh
Let me show you what you got to do
You gotta lay it back
Matter of fact? Band, show her how to lay it back, uh!
Show her how to lay it back, uh
Show her how to lay it back, aow
Show her how to lay it back
Alright!

Aye, now you got it, baby! You tryna have some fun tonight, you just gotta follow these simple instructions, you ready?
[Bridge]
You need to activate your sexy

Silky, smooth and snap
