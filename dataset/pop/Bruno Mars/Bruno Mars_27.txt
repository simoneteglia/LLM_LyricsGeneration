[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
First rule, never let 'em change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest (To the fullest)
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah
[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, yeah
The definition of real is
If you don't feel, then you don't feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great, don't need silicone to build it, or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
