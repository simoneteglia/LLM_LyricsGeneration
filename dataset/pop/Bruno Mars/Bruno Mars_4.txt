[Intro: Bruno Mars]
Say baby, say baby, say baby
[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak &
Bruno Mars
]
What you doin'? (
What you doin'?
)
Where you at? (
Where you at?
)
Oh, you got plans? (
You got plans
)
Don't say that (
Shut your trap
)
I'm sippin' wine (
Sip, sip
) in a robe (
Drip, drip
)
I look too good (
Look too good
)
To be alone (
Woo, woo
)
My house clean (
House clean
), my pool warm (
Pool warm
)
Just shaved,
smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
(Tell me that you're comin' through)
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak &
Bruno Mars
]
Ooh, you're so sweet (
So sweet),
so tight (So tight)
I won't bite (Uh-uh), unless you like (Unless you like)
If you smoke (What you smoke?), I got the haze (Purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be makin' (Shamone!)
I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin'
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms (If you tryna lay in these arms)
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Come on, girl)
[Bridge: Bruno Mars &
Anderson .Paak
]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
I need you, baby
)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
I got to see you, baby
)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
Girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah
)
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
And I'm hopin', hopin'
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Woo!)
[Outro: Bruno Mars
& Anderson .Paak
]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
Tell me
)
Tell me that you're comin' through
(
Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo
)
(
Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo
)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
La-la-la-la-la
)
Tell me that you're comin' through
Girl, I'm here just waitin' for you (
Oh!
)
Come on over, I'll adore you (
I gotta know!
)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (
I'm waitin', waitin', waitin'
)
Tell me that you're comin' through (
For you
)
Girl, I'm here just waitin' for you
Come on over, I'll adore you
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
