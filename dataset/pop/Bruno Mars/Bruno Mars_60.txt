[Verse 1]
There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
And I'm running out of things to do to get you off my mind, Ooh
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face everyday!
[Hook]
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
I wish that you were here with me!
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killing me!
Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
[Verse 2]
Now the minutes feel like hours and the hours feel like days
While I'm away
And no right now I can't be home
But im comin' home soon
Comin' home soon
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face again (OH!)
[Hook]
With you is where i'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
I wish that you were here with me!
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
Can you hear me crying?
(Oooohhhhh)
Can you hear me crying?
(Oooohhhh)
Can you hear me crying?
(ooohhh ohhhhhh) oh oh oh oh ohh
[Hook]
With you is where i'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
[Hook]
Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
[Outro]
There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
