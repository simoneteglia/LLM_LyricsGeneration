[Intro]
Baby squirrel, you's a sexy motherfucker
[Verse 1]
Gimme your, gimme your, gimme your attention, baby
I gotta tell you a little somethin' about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah
I know that you don't know it
But you're fine, so fine (Fine, so fine)
Oh, woah
Oh, girl, I'm gonna show you
When you're mine, oh, mine (Mine, oh, mine)
[Chorus]
Treasure
That is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, you should be smilin'
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah
I know that you don't know it
But you're fine, so fine (Fine, so fine)
Oh, woah
Oh, girl, I'm gonna show you
When you're mine, oh, mine (Mine, oh, mine)
[Chorus]
Treasure
That is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Oh, oh, oh
[Bridge]
You are my treasure
You are my treasure
You are my treasure
Yeah, you, you, you, you are
You are my treasure
You are my treasure
You are my treasure
Yeah, you, you, you, you are
[Chorus]
Treasure (You are my treasure)
That is what you are (You are my treasure)
(You are my treasure)
Honey, you're my golden star (You, you, you are)
(You are my treasure)
You know you can make my wish come true (You are my treasure)
(You are my treasure)
If you let me treasure you (You, you, you are)
(You are my treasure)
If you let me treasure you (You are my treasure)
Oh, oh, oh
