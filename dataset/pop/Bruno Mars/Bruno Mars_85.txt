Her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
I think I wanna marry you
His lips, his lips
I could kiss them all day if he let me
His laugh, his laugh
He hates but I think it's so sexy
He's so beautiful and I tell him everyday
I think I wanna marry you
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby -y- y eah
I'd catch a grenade for you (This one's for you and me)
I'd throw my hand on a blade for 'ya (Living out our dreams)
I'd jump in front of a train for 'ya (Lift my arms out wide)
You'd know I'd do anything for 'ya (I open my eyes)
O-oh, I would go through all of this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
If you walk away-ay-ay
Everyday it would rain-ain-ain-ay-ay-ay
Ohohohohohoho x3
Today I swear I'm not doing anything (I wanna be a billionaire)
I just wanna lay in my bed (So freakin' bad)
Don't feel like pickin' up my phone, so leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
So what we go out, so what we don't sleep
We're just having fun, we don't care who sees
So what we go out, that's how it's supposed to be
Living young, and wild, and free
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
I think I wanna marry you (And when you smile)
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are (I think I wanna marry you)
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
