[Intro: Conor]
My mind is tellin' me "no"
But my body, my body's tellin' me "yes"
Baby, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But there is somethin' that I must confess
[Verse 1: Alex],
Conor
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
I want to rock with you
(aye)
all night
Dance you into day
[Verse 2: Alex,
Conor
]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain, no
Say my name, say my name
when no one is around you
Say baby I love you
Let me hold you
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on
Turn me on
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message
[Verse 3: Alex,
Conor
,
Both
]
If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
Don't, love
Don't play wit it, don't be dishonest (yeah)
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you, you could have it
You
needed me
[Verse 4: Alex,
Conor
]
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion are you?
How deep is your love?
So we'll piss off the neighbors
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears, yeah
Baby you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
Treasure, that is what you are
I'm too good to you I'm way too good to you
Now I've got you in my space
I'd like to be, everything you want
[Verse 4: Alex,
Conor
]
[Conor Maynard]
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (ooh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Yeah, yeah, shorty got down low and said come and get me
yeah, yeah, next thing I knew
Como tú te llamas, yo no sé
De donde llegaste, ni pregunté
[Outro: Both]
24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe, soul player (oh)
