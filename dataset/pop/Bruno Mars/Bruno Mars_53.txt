[Verse 1]
All you, get back
Comin' to the stage is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name "Where Your Stacks At?"
This pretty little thing, I swear, won't let you down
Watch her drop it like
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hey (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance and
Money, money, money make her smile
[Post-Chorus]
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile
[Verse 2]
She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
Uh, no, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hey (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance and
Money, money, money make her smile
[Post-Chorus]
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got) Yeah
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile
[Interlude]
Yeah

Watch her
[Drop]
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Got, got, got, got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Got, got)
[Chorus]
Oh, it's not complicated so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance and
Money, money, money make her smile
[Post-Chorus]
