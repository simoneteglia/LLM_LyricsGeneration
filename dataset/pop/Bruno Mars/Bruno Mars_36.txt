[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Blow the dice for me (Hoo)
Put your pretty-ass lips together
Blow it real nice for me (Blow it real nice for me)
Yeah, I'm tryna hit a lick
And slide to the dealership in the mornin' (Why?)
Papa need a brand new foreign
Uh, hot hand, they not gon' believe me
But check the recordin'
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Ooh, just touched down, up a few thou' (Thou')
Big booty hoes meet me in the penthouse
Bar full of liquor (Liquor), cash for the strippers (Strippers)
It's gon' get weird tonight, so no pictures
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Pretty motherfucker with some money to blow
I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas after this roll
I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas after this roll
Come on, 7-7-7, let's go
Yes, Lord (Touch the money, everything, oh)
[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
(Ayy, now we makin' money, now we makin' money)
(Now we makin' money, one, two, three)
Spin the wheel for me (Hoo)
Blackjack, baccarat
Dealer, where you at? Deal for me
(Dealer, where you at? Where you at?)
Woo, give me the chips, give me the chips
'Cause I'm 'bout to go all in (Why?)
I can see the champagne fallin'
I got bills to pay, but bills can wait
Ah, fuck it, we ballin'
[Verse 4: Anderson .Paak]
Stacks on stacks (Stacks), racks on racks (Racks)
Moonwalk to the money like I'm Mike Jack
Yes, I'm faded, pupils dilated
But the man in the mirror sayin', "Go on, get your paper"
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Pretty motherfucker with some money to blow
I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas after this roll
I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas after this roll
Come on, 7-7-7, let's go
Oh, whatever you wanna do, baby
I got ya, I got ya
Oh, my God

This the big one, uh
You gotta trust your gut (
Gotta trust your gut
)
Can you feel it? (
I can feel it
)
Ooh, this the big one (
Big money
)
You gotta trust your gut (
Gotta trust your gut now, now
)
Can you feel it? (
I can feel it
)
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Pretty motherfucker with some money to blow
I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas after this roll
I'm 'bout to buy Las Vegas after this roll
Come on, 7-7-7 (Woo), let's go
(I told ya, I told ya, I told ya)
7-7-7, let's go (Woo)
(They can't deal with me, I swear to God)
