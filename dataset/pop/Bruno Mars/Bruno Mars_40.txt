[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Clouds are blowin', don't know where we're goin'
But we're levitatin' up in this room (Ah-ah-ah)
All these colors just like rainbows in summer
Got us smilin' like our dreams just came true (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I took a little somethin' to get here, yeah, yeah
I got a little more if you're ready, we can have it all
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
Oh, let's tiptoe to a magical place
Blast off and kiss the moon tonight
We'll watch the world go crazy from outer space
Blast off into the sky
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
As we're flyin', stars are multiplyin'
Wе're up so high, we'd be fools to look down (
Don't look down
)
Shapеs turn paisley, this is so amazin'
Destination, pure sensation startin' right now (Woo)
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I took a little somethin' to get here, yeah, yeah
I got a little more if you're ready, we can have it all
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
Oh, let's tiptoe to a magical place
Blast off and kiss the moon tonight
We'll watch the world go crazy from outer space
Blast off into the sky
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
Into the sky
Into the sky
Dance all night on Saturn's ring
If you got some friends that you wanna bring, then come on
It's time to take this party up and beyond
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak]
Let's tiptoe to a magical place (Come fly with me)
Blast off and kiss the moon tonight (To the moon and the stars above)
We'll watch the world go crazy from outer space
(Look, you know the place and I got the tickets to get there)
Blast off into the sky
[Outro: Bruno Mars &
Bootsy Collins
]
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh yeah)
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh yeah)
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh yeah)
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh yeah, come on)
Blastin' off straight to some good vibrations
Can we take it higher? (Oh yeah)
All the way from the stratosphere
Sendin' love from up above
Happy trails, baba
