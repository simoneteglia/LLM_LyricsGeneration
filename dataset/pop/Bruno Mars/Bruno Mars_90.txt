[Verse 1]
When you want to do something that is new
And it seems really, really hard to do
You feel like quitting, you feel you’re through
Well I have some advice for you
[Chorus]
Do not give up, keep on trying
You all going to make it (ah yeah) do not give up
Do not ever quit, try and try and you can do it, do not give up (yeah)
[Verse 2]
If you want to catch a ball, but you are having no luck at all
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose
It hits your belly, your chin and toes
Well try and try and try again, keep on trying and soon
You will put your hands out in the air
You will catch that ball, yes this I swear
[Chorus]
Do not give up, keep on going
You are on a boat, so keep on rowing
Do not give up, don’t ever stop
Try and try and you will come out on top, do not give up
[Verse 3]
You got yourself new roller-skates
You put them on and you feel great
Stand up, but then you fall
Do not think you can skate at all
You get back up and then you trip
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Well try and try and try some more
And soon you are skating across the floor
[Chorus]
Do not give up, keep on moving
You are going to get there just keep on grooving
Do not give up, do not pack it in
Try and try and you will win, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up, no no
Do not give up
