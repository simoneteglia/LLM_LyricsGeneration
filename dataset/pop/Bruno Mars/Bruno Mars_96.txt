[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three
Aw, yeah yeah
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!

Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!
[Verse 1]
Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimming in your water is something spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah yeah yeah
[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
[Post-Chorus]
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!
Aw, yeah yeah
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!
[Verse 2]
You bring me to my knees, you make me testify
You can make a sinner change his ways
Open up your gates cause I can't wait to see the light
And right there is where I wanna stay
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah yeah yeah
[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah yeah yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah yeah yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?
[Chorus]
Cause you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
[Outro]
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!
Aw, yeah yeah
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah, ooh!
