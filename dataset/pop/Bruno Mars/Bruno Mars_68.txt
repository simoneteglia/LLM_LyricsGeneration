[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
This hit, the ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one, for them hood girls
Them good girls
Straight masterpieces
Stylin', wilin'
Livin' it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty
[Refrain: Bruno Mars]
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and the fireman
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Say my name you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Am I bad 'bout that money
Break it down
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Girls hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Girls hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Girls hit your hallelujah (Woo!)
Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don’t believe me, just watch (come on)
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]

Hey, hey, hey, oh!
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Stop! Wait a minute
Fill my cup put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign the check
Julio! Get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon’ show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy
[Refrain: Bruno Mars]
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Call the police and the fireman
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Say my name you know who I am
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Am I bad 'bout that money
Break it down
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Girls hit your hallelujah (Woo!)

Doh
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
Before we leave (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
)
Lemme tell y'all a lil' something (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh

Come on, dance
Jump on it (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh

If you sexy then flaunt it (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
)
If you freaky then own it (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
)
Don't brag about it, come show me (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh
)
Come on, dance (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh

If you sexy then flaunt it (
Doh-doh-doh, doh-doh-doh, doh-doh)
Well, it's Saturday night and we in the spot
