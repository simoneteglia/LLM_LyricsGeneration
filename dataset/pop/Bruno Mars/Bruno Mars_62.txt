[Verse 1]
Oh, I was perfect for the circus
If she dared me I'd do it
Love makes you stupid
I gave it up
But I guess it was not enough
'Cause she never seemed satisfied, oh
[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect (Oh)
But at the end of the day who is? (Oh)
She wanted someone that's perfect
Okay, but can you tell me who is?
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh oh)
[Verse 2]
She set the bar just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it, but I still kept on reaching
She watched me try at least a thousand times
If she loved me she'd stopped me, but no (Oh)
[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect (Oh)
But at the end of the day who is? (Oh)
She wanted someone that's perfect
Ok, but can you tell me who is?
[Bridge]
I saw something worth my future
So wrong, so wrong
In my mind I was all it took, but I guess I wasn't wrong (Oh)
[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect (Oh)
But at the end of the day who is? (Oh)
She wanted someone that's perfect
Okay, but can you tell me who is?
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
