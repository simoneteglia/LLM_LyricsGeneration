[Intro]
Hands over my head
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would of stayed in bed
How can a day be so long?
[Pre-Chorus]
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe
[Chorus]
That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again
For you
[Verse 1]
I missed the first train, stood out in the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for
[Pre-Chorus]
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe
[Chorus]
That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again, oh
[Bridge]
Oh, who ever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Yea, I am so glad I fine with you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, I'll do it, I'll
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Do it all over again
I would do it all over again
I would do all over again for you
All I went through, led me to you
So I would do it all over again
[Outro]
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, oh
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, oh
