[Verse 1]
Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby
[Chorus]
Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
[Verse 2]
You've been living this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
'Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one you are looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see
[Chorus]
Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
[Verse 3]
All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends
[Chorus]
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal (Oh)
A heart that can't feel (Oh), it's broken (Broken)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows, oh)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (Damn)
His love is all she knows
