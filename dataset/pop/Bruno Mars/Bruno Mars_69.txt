[Intro]
The Stereotypes
[Verse 1]
It’s been so long since you been gone
And now we’re here
The music’s on
We’re feeling freaky (Oh)
I want you in my bedroom (Oh)
You want me closer to you
What are we doing?
Let’s get to it (Let's get to it)
[Verse 2]
I lay you down
Take off your clothes
And kiss your lips
It feels so good, ooh you’re saying more
I want to be inside you (More)
Ooh, girl you got that fire
I can’t wait no longer I just got to take control
[Pre-Chorus]
The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let’s pretend we both are alone
We’ll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you, girl
[Chorus]
Is to press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just (Press it, press it, press it, press it)
[Verse 3]
My favorite place is that space between your legs and your hips
Ooh, got me licking my lips
Want to get up on it
It’s a special thing that we be doing
Finna be bad boy
Girl I’m doing
Ain't no secret ’bout what it is
Come on girl serve me that dish
[Pre-Chorus]
The lights in the club are turning you on
Now girl let’s pretend we both are alone
We’ll finish this up when we get home
The only thing I need from you, girl (Come on)
[Chorus]
Is to press your body (Press your body)
On my body (On my body)
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo (Hey)
Look over your shoulder
(I just want to feel you)
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just
[Chorus]
Press your body (Press your body)
On my body (On my body)
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just press
[Bridge]
Girl you’re the only thing that I see
So don’t you take your body from me
And there’s no other place I’d rather be
Oh, girl, there’s something about your body, body, body
Ooh, the way you shaking is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good
The way you press your body on me
All I need from you
[Chorus]
Is to press your body
On my body
Do it fast, do it slow
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
Bring it back babe
Let me feel your body
Just
[Chorus]
Press your body
(Press your body on me, press your body on me)
On my body
(Press your body on me, press your body on me)
Do it fast, do it slow (Oh)
You control the tempo
Look over your shoulder
[Outro]
Girl, there’s something about your body, body, body
(There's something about your body)
Ooh, the way you shaking is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good
The way you press your body on me (The way you press your body on me)
All I need from you
Is to press it
