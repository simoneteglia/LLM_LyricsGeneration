[Intro]
Ahh, yes
[Verse 1]
Well, looky here, looky here, ahh, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing?
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holdin'
[Pre-Chorus]
"I love you so" (Hey) That's what you'll say (That's what you'll say)
You'll tell me,
"Baby, baby, please don't go away" (Don't go away)
But when I play (But when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say
[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby
[Post-Chorus]
Uh, ah-yeah
[Verse 2]
Well, let me think, let me think, ahh, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it!
[Pre-Chorus]
"I love you so" (Hey) That's what you'll say (That's what you'll say)
You'll tell me,
"Baby, baby, please don't go away" (Don't go away)
But when I play (But when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say
[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby, uh
[Bridge]
See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby, no, no
No, I just wanna work you, baby
If you scared, you better run
(You better run) You better run
(You better run) You better run
(You better run) You better, you better, you better
[Chorus]
Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby
