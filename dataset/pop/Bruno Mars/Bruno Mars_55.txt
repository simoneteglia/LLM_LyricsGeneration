[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, it's 4:00 a.m. (Uh) and you are up gettin' fucked up
And what a world (Uh), it is all girls, I'm in luck (Uh-huh)
Say, "Hello", to your sisters (Uh) and let's try some yoga (Uh-huh)
I'm Yoda, it's cold, but let's get it poppin' like soda
One will make a bridge and two will make a pose up
One will do the down dog and I will be the cobra
It's N*E*R*D where the party is never sorry, no illa
I take 'em to the head, now to the bed, said the red gorilla, yeah
[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker
And I'm feelin' like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down!
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now!
[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Look what you're doin', look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you. uh
I promise it's a killer
You'll be bangin' on my chest, bang, bang

Hey, we got it hotter than an Amazon
Got ya cheetah bra with your heels on
And I'm about to be the king of your jungle like
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah" (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, it's like a rain forest, baby, how I got your love pourin' down
