Drop top Porsche (Porsche), Rollie on my wrist (Wrist)
Diamonds up and down my chain (Aha)

Bossed up and I changed the game (You see me?)
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook (Shook)
My big fat ass got all them boys hooked (Hooked)
Went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands (Ha)
