[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
I'll be the light to guide you
[Pre-Chorus]
We find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
If you're tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
Every day, I will remind you, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
We find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go
Never say goodbye
You know
[Chorus]
You can count on me like 1, 2, 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you like 4, 3, 2
And you'll be there
'Cause that's what friends are s'posed to do, oh yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
You can count on me, 'cause I can count on you
