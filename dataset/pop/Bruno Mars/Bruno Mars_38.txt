[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
One, two
[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Warm night, can't sleep, too hurt, too weak
Gotta call her up
Dial that number, no one answers
'Til it's two o'clock
[Refrain: Bruno Mars]
And if by chance, you let me come over
Out on the street, I wanna see you, baby
And if by chance, you let me just hold ya
I'm down on my knee, I wanna please you, baby
Ooh, I'll be your righteous lover
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
She said, "Sugar, honey, darlin'
I really wanna see you, too"
(I bet you do, bet you do, bet you do)
It's just that someone's over and, baby
I really wanna be with you
[Refrain: Bruno Mars]
But if by chance, you let me just hold ya
I'm callin', I'm free, I wanna see you, baby
Ooh, when in need, you said you wouldn't be here
And you hold the key to my very being, baby, I
(I lovе you, baby) I love you, baby
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
If you are that special lovеr
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
Sometimes, heartstrings can be broken
But you just have to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
On a warm night, lady wants her baby
So she calls him up
(Ah, when it ring-a-ling, it only mean one thing, come on)
Dial that number, no one answers
'Til it's two o'clock
[Refrain: Bruno Mars]
And if by chance, you just come on over, girl
I'm sick and, please, I've got to see you, baby
Ooh, when in need, you said you would be right here
Well, I'm in need, I need you to please believe, please believe
I love you, baby!
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak
with Bruno Mars
]
If you are that special lover (Woo)
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
(You don't need no, you don't need no ticket to ride, ah)
Sometimes, heartstrings can be broken
But you just have to keep on goin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Listen, baby, listen, baby)
If deep sorrow, you been soakin'
But you just have to keep on strokin'
That's the way it goes on love's train
(Love's a hurtin' thang, yo, it makes you wanna cry, come on)
If you are that special lover
And love keeps you tied to another
That's the way it goes on love's train
[Outro: Bruno Mars]
Oh
