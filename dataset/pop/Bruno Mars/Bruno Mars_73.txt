[Verse 1]
She wakes up in the morning
Jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion
While she is wrapped in a towel
Ain't no music on, but she dance to perfection
I swear the bathrooms the club
The way she's showing to her reflection
[Break]
Every morning, I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show
[Chorus]
My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror
Dance
Oh she so cute, cute, cute
Dancing in the nude, nude, nude
Oh
My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror, dance in the mirror
[Verse 2]
It's late in the evening
We got dinner reservations
Oh, oh
She's taking her time
But I don't mind waiting
No, no
I don't get impatient
'Cause when she gets naked
Ooh the temptation (ooh the temptation)
You make me wanna cancel all of our plans
Keep you right where you stand
Just wanna see you dance, oh
[Break]
Every morning, I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show
'
[Chorus]
My favorite part of the day (part if the day)
Is when she dance (dance, dance) in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror (ooh)
Dance
Oh she so cute (cute), cute (cute), cute (cute)
Dancing in the nude (nude), nude (nude), nude (nude)
Oh
My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance (dance) in the mirror, dance (dance) in the mirror
[Breakdown]
Oh, she's singing to herself like
Daa da da da da da da (oh)
Oh, she's singing to herself like
Daa da daa da da da da (oh)
[Chorus]
Ooh, my favorite part of the day (part if the day)
Is when she dance in the mirror (dance in the mirror)
Oh, there's nothing more I can say (nothing more, nothing more)
Just watch her dance in the mirror, dance in the mirror
Dance
Oh she so cute (cute), cute (cute), cute
Dancing in the nude (nude), nude (nude), nude (nude)
Oh
My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror, dance in the mirror
