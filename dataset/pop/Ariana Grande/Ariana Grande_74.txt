[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Ooh-ooh, hey
(
If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
)
Put your hands up (
Put your hands up
), ooh, yeah

If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party

So put your hands up (
Put your hands up

[Refrain: Ariana Grande &

You got it, you got it, babe (

Sean Don
)
You got it, you got it, babe
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doin' what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon (Moon)
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you? (Got you, I got you)
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally, the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need (Ayy), I know what you like (Ayy)
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright (Hey)
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you, I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (Right there)
Right there (Right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different, no one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there
[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe (
If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
)
You got it, you got it, babe, yeah (
Put your hands up, put your hands up, hands up
)
[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
And I get butterflies just thinkin'
About you, boy, you're on my mind (Oh)
Sometimes, I catch myself daydreamin'
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time (Track of time)
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need (Ayy), I know what you like (Ayy)
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright (Hey)
How can this be wrong (Oh), when it feels so right? (Oh)
Yeah, I really need you, I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go
[Chorus: Ariana Grande,
Big Sean
]
You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (Right there)
Right there (Right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different, no one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there (
What? Okay
)
I'll always be right there (
What?
)
[Verse 3: Big Sean &
Ariana Grande
]
Now, if it all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (Swerve, swerve)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waitin'? (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player, too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go
(I got you)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande,
Big Sean
]
You should know (
Oh
), I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change;
Woah
)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay;
Oh
)
You call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there)
Right there (Ooh)
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different, no one compares
And if you never change (
B-I-G Sean Don
)
I'm gonna stay right there (
Carry on
)
I'll always be right there (
Yeah
)
[Outro: Ariana Grande,

If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
