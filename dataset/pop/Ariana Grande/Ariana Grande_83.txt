[Intro]
No, yeah
Hey
[Verse 1]
Boy, you know that you drive me crazy
But it's one of the things I like
'Cause I know when you need it, baby
That I got that, ooh-ooh
Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talkin'
But it don't matter what they say
'Cause you know when you hear me knockin'
Gonna get that, ooh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been doing stupid things (Ayy)
Wilder than I've ever been (Ayy)
You've become my favorite sin
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
That's right
[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love
They say it's wrong
But, that's the way you turn me on
We got that hood love
We got that good love
Make me make bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions
Bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions
[Verse 2]
No, they ain't gonna understand it
Understand what I see in you
They don't know when you touch my body
That I see the truth
Let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
'Cause I know that I got someone
Anytime that I need some danger
Gonna get that, ooh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been doing stupid things (Ah)
Wilder than I've ever been
You've become my favorite sin
So let 'em keep, let 'em keep on talking
That's right
[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love
They say it's wrong (They say it's wrong)
But, that's the way you turn me on
We got that hood love
We got that good love
Make me make bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions (Boy, you make me)
Bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions (Boy, babe)
[Bridge]
Nah, yeah
Don't you know I ain't fuckin' with them good boys?
Know you love me like ain't nobody could, boy
If you want it, boy, you got it
Ain't you ever seen a princess be a bad bitch?
[Chorus]
We got that hood love
We got that good love
We got that hot love
We got that "I don't give a what" love
We got that one life
Gimme that all night
We got that Bonnie and Clyde love
They say it's wrong (They say it's wrong)
But, that's the way you turn me on (You turn me on, babe)
We got that hood love
We got that good love
Make me make bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions (Bad decision)
Bad
Boy, you make me make bad decisions (Ooh)
Bad (Mm, yeah)
Boy, you make me make bad decisions (Bad decision)
Bad (Bad)
Boy, you make me make bad decisions
