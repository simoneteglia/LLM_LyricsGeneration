[Intro: Ariana Grande &
Iggy Azalea
]
(Mm-hm-mm)
Uh-huh!
(Ha-ha-ha, ha)
It's Iggy Iggz!
I got one more problem with you, girl
(One less, one less problem)
Hey!
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Hey, baby, even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya (I want yo-o-ou)
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to (I want yo-o-ou)
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it (I want yo-o-ou)
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
[Chorus: Big Sean &
Ariana Grande
]
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up (But it's yo-o-ou)
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back (But it's yo-o-ou)
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it (But it's yo-o-ou)
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
[Chorus: Big Sean &
Ariana Grande
]
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (
Ooh, babe
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Ooh, woah
)
I got one less, one less problem
[Interlude: Iggy Azalea]
It's Iggy Iggz!
Uh, what you got?
[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand, my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's, baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got ninety-nine problems but you won't be one,
like what?
[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Mm, nah (One less, one less problem)
Mm, yeah (One less, one less problem)
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
(One less, one less problem)
I should be wiser and realize that I've got (One less, one less problem)
[Chorus: Big Sean,
Ariana Grande
&
Iggy Azalea
]
One less problem without ya (
Babe
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Oh-ooh, babe
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Ooh
)
I got one less, one less problem
(
Ooh, baby
)
One less problem without ya (
Yeah, I got
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Woo, hey!
)
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem, babe
(
Woo
)
One less problem without ya (
Uh
,
hey
)
I got one less problem without ya (
Without you
)
I got one less problem without ya (
I got one less, one less, yeah
)
I got one less, one less problem
(
Yeah
)
