[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Hey
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
[Verse 2: John Legend
with Ariana Grande
]
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
[Verse 3: Ariana Grande & John Legend,
John Legend
]
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-woah
[Bridge: Ariana Grande,
John Legend
&
Both
]
Hey
Yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh
[Verse 4: Both,
John Legend
&
Ariana Grande
]
Ever just the same, oh
And ever a surprise, yeah
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 5: Ariana Grande
with John Legend
]
Tale as old as time, ayy
Tune as old as song, oh
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong, woah
[Verse 6: John Legend,
Ariana Grande
&
Both
]
Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
(Mm-hm-mm)
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
[Outro: John Legend,
Ariana Grande
&
Both
]
Woah (
Yeah-ayy
)
Beauty andâ€” (
Ayy
)
Beauty and the Beast
