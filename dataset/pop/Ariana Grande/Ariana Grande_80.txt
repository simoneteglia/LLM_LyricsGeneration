[Verse 1]
Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point?
No
[Chorus]
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore, mm
[Verse 2]
Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me
Used to have a hold on me (Used to have a hold on me)
Like what do you think, and what he thinks, and what they think
But I love me, yeah-yeah
[Chorus]
I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore, oh
[Outro]
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
I-I-I, yeah-yeah, yeah, uh
Oh-woah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh-ooh, uh
I-I don't care about it anymore
I-I don't care about it anymore, no
