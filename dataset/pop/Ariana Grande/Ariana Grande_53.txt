[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Yeah
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
You know you're really something, yeah
How we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I’d feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Mmm
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl (Oh)
It's timе for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry storе and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts (Ooh, yeah)
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out (Ooh)
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande,
with Ty Dolla $ign
,
Ty Dolla $ign
]
I've never been this
scared before
Feelings I just
can't ignore
Don't know if I should
fight or fly
But I don't mind  (
I don't mind, I don't mind
)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande,
with Ty Dolla $ign
,
Ty Dolla $ign
]
Mmm (
Sheesh, woo
)
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said (Something that you said,
said, ayy
)
Is it real this time or is it in my head? (
In my head, oh, in my head
, head, yeah)
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
[Bridge: Ariana Grande,
with Ty Dolla $ign
]
(Yeah)
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away, my baby
Every time you
feel some way, feel a way
Never let
me run away,
run away
[Chorus: Ariana Grande
with Ty Dolla $ign
,
Ty Dolla $ign
]
Girl, you got me
tripping, falling, with no safety net
(With no safety net,
oh-ah
, baby)
Boy, it must be
something that you said
(Something that you said)
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
(Is it in my head?
Is it all in my head?
Oh, baby)
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net (With no safety net)
[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Oh hey
Ah yeah
