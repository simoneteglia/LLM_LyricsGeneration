[Bridge]
Boy, you know the vibes, I don't waste no time
Take what's on your mind, make it real life
Get all the homies to bounce
Switch from the bed to the couch
And get to know how I'm feelin' inside
So much conversation, words so sweet
Been so well-behaved, but, boy, I'm weak
Yeah, my body's gotta say something to you
That's one way to tell I speak the truth
[Chorus]
Don't wanna wait on it (Baby, I)
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (Oh hey)
What you waitin' for? (What you waitin' for? Mmm)
What you waitin' for? (Yeah)
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty
What you waitin' for? (What you waitin' for?)
What you waitin' for? (What you waitin' for?)
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (Tonight, I wanna get, mmm)
(Tonight, baby)
Tonight, I wanna get nasty (Oh)
Yeah
