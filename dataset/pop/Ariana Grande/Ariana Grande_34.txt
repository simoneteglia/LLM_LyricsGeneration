[Verse 1]
I've been outta sight
I've been worried 'bout you lately
Runnin' outta time
Wishin' you would come and save me
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna roll with it (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna get control of it (Yeah, yeah)
Why can't I let go of it? (Yeah, yeah, mmm)
Gotta find somebody quickly (Mmm, yeah)
[Chorus]
I got a bad idea
How 'bout we take a little bit of time away?
I got a bad idea
Forget about it, yeah, forget about him, yeah
Forget about me (

Yeah, I'ma call you over here to numb the pain (

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know we shouldn't, baby, but we will (You know we will)

But, boy, don't trip (Don't trip), you know this isn't real
You should know I'm temporary
