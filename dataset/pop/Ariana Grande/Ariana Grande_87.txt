[Intro]
Ah
[Verse 1]
Pull up, pull up on me, ah
Might just recline the seat when I want it
Give you a set of keys 'cause you own it
Pull up, pull up on me, ayy
No second guessin', checkin' the rearview
Ain't lookin' back unless it's right at you
[Pre-Chorus]
Make me wanna stay through the night
I will never leave from by your side
Don't you know you got a ride or die? Ah
Even when I miss you on the road
You should know I'm always in control
'Cause the one thing I already know
[Chorus]
No, I don't feel the need to
Test drive nothin', test drive nothin'
Baby, I'm sold on you, so I don't ever gotta
Tеst drive nothin' (Oh), test drive nothin' (My baby)
It's in thе way you do it, I don't ever gotta, baby
[Verse 2]
I drop the top on that body
That's candy paint on my body
I'm thinkin' 'bout the way I feel on you
If you want, say, "I do" (I do)
I'll floor it (I'll floor it)
Just say the word, you know I'm yours (Know I'm yours)
Just drop a pin and don't reverse (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Make me wanna stay through the night (Oh, babe)
I will never leave from by your side (Leave from by your side)
Don't you know you got a ride or die? Ah
Even when I miss you on the road
You should know I'm always in control
'Cause the one thing I already know
[Chorus]
No, I don't feel the need to
Test drive nothin' (No, babe), test drive nothin'
Baby, I'm sold on you, so I don't ever gotta
Test drive nothin', test drive nothin'
It's in the way you do it, I don't ever gotta
