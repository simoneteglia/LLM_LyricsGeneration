[Intro]
Hey
[Verse 1]
I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
'Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doin' what I like
I'm over here workin' day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo
[Chorus: Jamie Foxx &
Ariana Grande
]
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me, woo
Focus on me (
Focus
), f-f-focus on me, woo (
Focus on me
)
Focus on me (
Focus
), f-f-focus on me, woo (
Focus on me
)
[Verse 2]
I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit (Hey)
I know you're hopin' that I'll react (Ayy)
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is (Hey, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's find a light inside our universe now (Mm-yeah)
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down (No one keep on holdin' us down)
Just come and get it, let them say what they say (Ooh)

Ariana Grande
