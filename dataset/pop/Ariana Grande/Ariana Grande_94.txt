[Verse 1]
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah (
It's The Rascals!
)
[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special, oh, yeah
But last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
[Verse 2]
Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
The last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day, you gave it away (Gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears (You got it)
I'll give it to someone special (Oh)
The last Christmas (My baby), I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (Gave it away)
This year (Oh, baby), to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah
How could you leave Christmas mornin'?
You broke my heart with no warnin'
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
(Oh, yeah) Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (Gave you my heart)
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears (Oh, baby)
I'll give it to someone special
[Outro]
This is our (Last) last, (Last) last Christmas
You broke my heart
(Last) Last, (Last) last Christmas
You broke my heart (Ooh, yeah)
This year (Ooh), to save me from tears (Ooh-oh)
I'll give it to someone special (Oh)
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (You left my heart a mess)
(This year, to save me from tears) You blew it
(I'll give it to someone special) You do it, do it
I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess
This year, to save me from tears (Boy, you blew it)
I'll give it to someone special (How could you do it, do it?)
