[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Will I ever love the same way again? (
Way again
)
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? (
Next life
)
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? (
Too steady
)
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Will you be thеre? (Will you be there?)
Can I still love you? (Can I, can I, babe?)
Not yet healed or ready (Not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
[Verse 2: The Weeknd,
Ariana Grande
&
Both
]
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it (
You can see right through it
)
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to
someone else
I was haunted by the hills (Oh yeah, yeah)
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms (Your arms)
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &
The Weeknd
]
Will you be there? (
Yes, I will be there for you
)
Can I still love you? (
Yes, I been hurt before, before
)
Not yet healed or ready (Not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (Too steady, no, no)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
[Bridge: Ariana Grande &
The Weeknd
]
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? (
Oh, no-no, no
)
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head (
Oh, woah
)
Tryna be here from this bed (
Oh
)
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby (
Hey
)
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? (Oh, hey)
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully (Baby, don't leave)
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again (
Woah
)
Baby, baby (
Woo-hoo
)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &
The Weeknd
]
Will you be there? (Will you be there?
I'll still wait
)
Can I still love you? (
I'll still wait for you, babe, oh, no-no, no,
can I still love you?)
Not yet healed or ready (
Ooh
, not ready)
Should I be goin' too steady? (No, no,
ooh
)
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?
[Outro: The Weeknd]
I swear, I swear
I will wait for you whenever you need
Ooh, ooh
