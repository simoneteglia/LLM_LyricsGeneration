[Intro]
You can feel it, feel it
(Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice? Mm-mm
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down; Down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone
[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yeah), that is why we talking about it (Get better)
Yeah, we talking about it (Get better, get better)
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Get better, get better)
Ain't no time to deny it (Get better, get better)
So we had to sit down and just write it
(Get better)
[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mm-mm?
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this?
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
(Down, down, down, down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Before I'm gone
[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body (Uh-huh; Yuh, yuh)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yuh; Oh, yeah), that is why we talking about it (Yuh, yuh; Baby)
(Get better)
Yeah, we talking about it (Get better, get better)
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Get better, get better; Ooh)
Ain't no time to deny it (Get better, get better; Yeah)
So we had to sit down and just write it (Get better)
[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top
(You can feel it, feel it)
(Ooh; Oh, my)
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops (You can feel it, feel it)
(Ooh; Oh-ayy)
Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked" (You can feel it, feel it, yuh)
(Ooh)
Just know there is so much room at the top
(You can feel it, feel it, yee)
(Ooh)
[Refrain]
(Ah, ah, ah)
Well, here's one thing you can trust (Yuh)
It take you and me to make us (Yeah)
One of those days you had enough (Yeah), I'll be there (Yeah, yuh, yuh, yuh)
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another (It's another)
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble (Out the bubble)
I'll be right there just to hug you (Just to hug you),
I'll be there (Yuh, yuh, hey)
Where are you? Are you home? (Where are you? Are you home?)
Call me right on the phone (Call me right on the phone)
I'll be there (Ayy, sheesh), yeah, I'll be there (Yuh, yuh)
I don't care who is gone (I don't care who is gone), you shouldn't be alone (You shouldn't be alone)
I'll be there (Mm-mm), there
[Bridge]
You can work your way to the top (Woo!)
(You can feel it, feel it, woo)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me, I'm with you, I'm with you)
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops (You can feel it, feel it, babe)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me, I'm with you, I'm with you; Ah, ayy)
Unfollow fear and just say, "You are blocked" (You can feel it, feel it, yuh)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me, I'm with you, I'm with you; Ah-ah)
Just know there is so much room at the top (You can feel it, feel it, yee)
(I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, just call me, no matter the issue)
No matter what
[Refrain]
(Ah-ah-ah)
Here's one thing you can trust (Yeah)
It take you and me to make us (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
One of those days you had enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah), I'll be there, I'll be there (I'll be there)
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another (It's another)
If you need someone to pull you out the bubble (Out the bubble)
I'll be right there just to hug you (Just to hug you, yee), I'll be there (I'll be there)
Where are you? Are you home? (Where are you? Are you home?) Call me right on the phone (Call me right on the phone)
I'll be there (I'll be there), yeah, I'll be there
I don't care who is gone (I don't care who is gone), you shouldn't be alone (You shouldn't be alone)
I'll be there, ooh, there
[Outro]
You can work your way to the top (You can feel it, feel it)
