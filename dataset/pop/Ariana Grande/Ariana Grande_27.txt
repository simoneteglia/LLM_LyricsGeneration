[Intro: Marjorie Grande]
Because I'm trying to do the best I can
And they can't find something to satisfy me, ugh
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Mmm, yeah, yuh
Even though you're bad for me, I know
You're the one that I'm thinkin'
Got me feelin' so incredible
Would you mind maybe linkin'?
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
Put it down, then it's time to go
Get it like you love me
But you don't, boy, it's just for show
Take it or leave it, you gotta take it or leave it like uh
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Don't want you in my bloodline, yeah
Just wanna have a good time, yeah
And no need to apologize, no
But you gon' have to let this shit go
Don't want you in my bloodline, yeah
Not tryna make you all mine, yeah
And no need to apologize, no
But you gon' have to let this shit go, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh
Yeah, yeah, yuh
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
No, we won't be talking the next day
I ain't got nothin' to say (Hell nah)
I ain't lookin' for my one true love
Yeah, that ship sailed away
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Love me, love me, baby
Are you down? Can you let me know?
Love me, thank you, leave me
Put it down, then it's time to go
Get it like you love me
But you don't, boy, it's just for show
Take it or leave it, you gotta take it or leave it like uh
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Don't want you in my bloodline, yeah
Just wanna have a good time, yeah
And no need to apologize, no
But you gon' have to let this shit go
Don't want you in my bloodline, yeah (Don't want you in my)
Not tryna make you all mine, yeah (Not tryna make you)
And no need to apologize, no (And no need to, yeah)
But you gon' have to let this shit go, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Oh, yeah
Yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Say I know what you want, what you want from me
I know what you think, what you think you see (So what you think)
I know what you looking for, but I'm complete (Yee)
I know what you need, but it won't be me
I know what you want, what you want from me
I know what you think, what you think you see
I know what you looking for, but I'm complete
I know what you need, but it won't be me (But it won't be me)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Don't want you in my bloodline, yeah (Don't want you in my bloodline)
Just wanna have a good time, yeah (Just tryna have a good time)
And no need to apologize, no (No)
But you gon' have to let this shit go (Yeah, yeah)
Don't want you in my bloodline, yeah
Not tryna make you all mine, yeah
And no need to apologize, no
But you gon' have to let this shit go, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
