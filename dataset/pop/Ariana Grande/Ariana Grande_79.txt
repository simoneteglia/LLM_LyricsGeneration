[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don’t make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can’t give it all away if he won't be here next year
[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryin' to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blastin' out
But I won't get in the mood
I’m avoiding every mistletoe until I know it’s
[Pre-Chorus]
True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy
[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you’re really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can’t give it all away if he won't be here next year
[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night ('Mas night)
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold (Yeah)
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
[Pre-Chorus]
True love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy
[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna let him unwrap me, like, oh-ooh-oh (Ooh)
Get on top of him, by that fireplace, oh-ooh-oh (Ooh-oh)
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year, I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
[Refrain]
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
If he won't be, if he won't be here
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
Oh, woah
[Chorus]
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
(
Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me
)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
[Outro]
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Tell me, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If you won't be, if you won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
