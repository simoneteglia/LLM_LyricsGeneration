[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I just broke up with my ex
Now I'm out here single, I don't really know what's next
But I ain't even trippin', I'ma chill and sit back
And I know they will be comin' from the right and the left
Left, left
I just broke up with my ex and
You're the one I'm feeling as I'm laying on your chest
Good conversation got me holding my breath
And I don't normally say this but goddamn, you the best
Best, best
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind (Ah)
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
As I'm laying on your chest
I'll be out here thinkin' 'bout it, boy, it's just a guess
But something just keeps telling me I'm better than the rest
And I ain't tryna rush you, but, goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if it feels right, promise I don't mind (Ah)
And if it feels right, promise I'll stay here all night
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I say, "Girl, you need a hot boy"
She say, "You need to stop **** with them thots, boy"
I say "You need a real ****," she say, "Yes, Lord"
And what you need your ex for? I'm triple X, Lord
Okay, Ariana my lil mama, goodbye to the good girl
My ex tripping, it's no Biggie, I 2Pac shook her
I'm laid up with my new thing
She lay her head on my new chain
Then the mood change, then my name change
From Lil Wayne to "Ooh, Wayne," oh, Lord
She grinding on this Grande, oh, Lord
I'm drowning, I'm gonna need that Coast Guard
And when it comes to that ****, I give her amnesia
She just looking for love, she say she single and I'm her feature
Oh, my God
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Lil Wayne
]
(You're no good, boy, just let me love you, baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
Tunechi, Mula baby
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
(Boy, just let me love you, yeah, yeah, ah)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She just looking for love

Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She just looking for love, yeah
(Yeah, I'm looking for love, baby)
Just let me lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-love you, you
She just looking for love, yeah
