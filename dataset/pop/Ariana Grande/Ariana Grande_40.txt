[Intro]
Ooh-ooh (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Ooh-ooh, oh (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
[Verse 1]
A few weeks ago
I saw you front row
And my heart stopped at the sight (Ooh, yeah)
Thought you were solo (Thought you were solo)
But you got a girl though (But you got a girl though)
And my life ain't been the same
Been feelin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Mentally, physically weak (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Boys blowin' up my phone (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)
They just ain't you, oh, baby
I'm meant to be on my own (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
But just before I go (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)
There's something you should know
And boy, I
[Chorus]
I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five
Five-to-nine
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of (Way) way (Way)
That just ain't me
[Verse 2]
A few months later
You're still togеther (Oh, babe)
And you just can't tell mе why (Why?)
So, boy, stop pretendin' (Yeah)
'Cause I won't keep waitin'
I'm out the door, bye, bye, bye (I'm totally leaving right now)
Been feelin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Mentally, physically weak (Weak) (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Boys blowin' up my phone (My phone) (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)
They just ain't you, oh, baby (You)
I'm meant to be on my own (I'd rather be on my own) (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
But just before I go (Before I go) (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)
There's something you should know (Should know)
And boy, I
[Chorus]
I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine (If you were mine, baby)
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five (Nine-to-five)
Five-to-nine (Five-to-nine)
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of (Way) way (Way)
That just ain't me
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
(I could never do anything like that)
Ooh-ooh, oh (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
(I mean, I would, but, I'm just too nice, and too hot)
[Pre-Chorus]
Mentally, physically weak
Boys blowin' up my phone
They just ain't you, ooh, baby
[Chorus]
I fantasize about it all the time
If you were mine (If you were mine)
I'd give this pussy to you, nine-to-five
Five-to-nine
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of way (Some type of way)
That just ain't me
[Outro]
Ooh-ooh (Haha, ha) (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
That just ain't me, baby
Ooh-ooh, oh (Ooh, ah) (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tryna behave
Tryin' to behave, but I'm feelin'
Some type of way (Some type of way)
That just ain't me
