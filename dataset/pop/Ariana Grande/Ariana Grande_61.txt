[Verse 1]
Oh, I know you're probably thinkin', "What's the use?"
I promise it's the little things that you do
That make me wanna give it all to you
You know I do, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh, babe
Baby
Been a minute since I had somethin' so sweet
[Chorus]
If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feelin' anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
[Verse 2]
Why would I double back or do the same thing twice?
A question, somethin' that I can't deny
Lеft my baggage at the door, I'll claim you mine
All minе
[Pre-Chorus]
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh, honey
Baby
It's been a minute since I had somethin' so sweet, mm, oh
[Chorus]
If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feelin' anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
[Bridge]
Baby, pardon my French, but could you speak in tongues?
Never lost in translation 'cause you know what I want, boy
Treat it just like Givenchy (Givenchy), it's expensive to taste
Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face (Face)
[Chorus]
If you're gon' keep speakin' my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feelin' anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearnin' what ain't right
I want you to keep speakin' my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
[Outro]
Head over my shoes like woah
Know you like an inside joke
Runnin' 'cause you're just my speed
'Less you want it in slo-mo (In slo-mo)
I'm not what you had before (Had before)
Your ex-girlfriend don't want no smoke
(No smoke)
I ain't tryna sign no lease
I'm just gon' make you my home
