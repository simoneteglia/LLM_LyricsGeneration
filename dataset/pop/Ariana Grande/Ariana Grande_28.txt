[Verse 1]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey-yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started, the temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move (
Move
)
Before I make a move (
Move
)
[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
[Verse 2]
Ooh, yeah
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, look what you started, the temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move (
Move
)
Before I make a move (
Move
)
[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up, and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but, baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so, baby, let's keep it secret (Mm)
A little bit scandalous, but, baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you ('Cause I'm so into you)
[Bridge]
Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh-woah, yeah
[Chorus]
So, baby, come light me up (Light me up) and, baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous (Dangerous), but, baby, that's how I want it (How I want it)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (No, ayy)
Got everyone watchin' us (Watchin' us), so, baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous (Scandalous), but, baby, don't let them see it (Yeah)
A little less conversation (Yeah) and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (Ooh, ooh)
[Outro]
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
Little dangerous
A little dangerous, my boy (How I want it)
A little less conversation
And a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you
Into you, into you
('Cause I'm so into you)
