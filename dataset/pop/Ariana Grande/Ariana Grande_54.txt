[Intro]
Ha-ah, ah-yeah
Oh, oh-woah
Ah-yeah
Say
[Verse 1]
Midnight shadows
When finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing
[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright (Hey)
We're gonna be alright (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
We're gonna be alright
[Refrain]
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it
[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright (Hey-hey, hey)
We're gonna be alright, yeah (Ah-ayy, ah-ayy, ah, oh, yeah, hey)
We're gonna be alright
[Verse 2]
In slow motion
Can't seem to get where we're going
But the hard times are golden
'Cause they all lead to better days
[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright (Hey)
We're gonna be alright, babe (Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
We're gonna be alright
[Refrain]
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright (Ooh, yeah)
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it (Ooh)
[Chorus]
We're gonna be alright (Hey)
We're gonna be alright, ooh, baby, ooh (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
We're gonna be alright
[Outro]
We're gonna be alright, ayy, ayy
