[Verse 1]
Say you want me anyway, do ya?
You can handle all this fame, can ya?
Like me just the way I are
Just the way I, way I are, yeah, yeah
You would like me anyway, would ya?
You won't let me get away, won't ya?
Like me just the way I are
Say you don't wanna be a star, do you?
[Pre-Chorus]
We step out on a Friday night
New front page, it's a cute headline
I made you a thing, like, "Who's that guy?"
Say you ain't in it for the spotlight, boy
[Chorus]
I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for
Been on the low when it comes to love (When it comes, when it comes to love)
Said, "Do you like how I look or just how I look on you?"
[Verse 2]
Cover on a magazine in just two weeks
"Boy to Watch", ain't he just, just too sweet?
Now he ain't even got time for me
I only see him on the big screen
Woke up at like five, and boy, you wasn't here
When it's my fault, she even knows that you're there
Was I just a transition?
Boy, remember where ya come from
[Pre-Chorus]
We step out on a Friday night
New front page, it's a cute headline
I made you a thing, like, "Who's that guy?"
Say you ain't in it for the spotlight, boy
[Chorus]
I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for (In it for)
Been on the low when it comes to love (When it comes to love)
Said, "Do you like how I look or just how I look on you?"
[Break]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
How I look on you
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
How I look on you
[Outro]
How I look on you
How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you, oh yeah
How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you
How I look, how I look on you
