[Verse 1]
Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don't know where to start (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Yeah, yeah (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
No, no (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
[Pre-Chorus]
When I try to explain it, I be soundin' insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied (
And twisted
)
I can't explain what (
I'm feelin'
)
And I say, "Baby, baby" (
Oh-woah-woah
), "Baby"
[Chorus]
(
Baby, I
) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(
Baby, I
) Oh, baby, baby, I
(
Baby, I
) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (
Oh-woah-woah
)
[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm so down for you
No matter what'cha do (
Real talk
), I'll be around (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Yeah, yeah (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Oh, baby
See, baby, I been feelin' you
Before I even knew what feelings were about (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
Oh, baby (
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
)
[Pre-Chorus]
When I try to explain it (
Ooh
), I be soundin' all crazy
Words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied (
And twisted
)
I can't explain what (
I'm feelin'
)
And I say, "Baby, baby" (
Oh-woah-woah
), "Baby"
[Chorus]
(
Baby, I
) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(
Baby, I
) Oh, baby, baby, I
(
Baby, I
) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything (
Baby
)
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (
Oh-woah, oh-woah
)
(
Baby, baby
) Ooh-ayy
[Bridge]
Straight up, you got me (
Ah-ah
) all in
(
How
) Could I not be?
I sure hope you know (
I sure hope you know
)
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than the word "love" can say (
Say
)
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep saying "Baby, I"
[Chorus]
(
Baby, I
) Oh, baby, oh, baby, my baby
(
Baby, I
) Oh, baby, baby, I
(
Baby, I
) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (
Oh-woah, oh-woah
)
Baby (
Baby, baby
), baby, I (
Baby, I
)
Oh, baby (Ooh), oh, baby, my baby (Baby, I)
(
Baby, I
) Oh, baby, baby, I (Ah)
(
Baby, I
) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it (Ooh)
Every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (
Oh-woah-woah
)
Baby, baby
