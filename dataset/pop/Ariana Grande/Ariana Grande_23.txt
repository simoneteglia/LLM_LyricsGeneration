[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothin' at all
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
It's comin' down on me
Water like misery
It's comin' down on me
I'm ready, rain on me
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me
[Drop: Lady Gaga,
Ariana Grande
]
Rain on me
Mm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande,
Lady Gaga
]
I can feel it on my skin (
It's comin' down on me
)
Teardrops on my face (
Water like misery
)
Let it wash away my sins (
It's comin' down on me
)
Let it wash away, yeah-yeah
[Chorus: Both,
Lady Gaga
,
Ariana Grande

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain

[Bridge: Both,

Hands up to the sky
I'll be your galaxy
I'm about to fly
Rain on me, tsunami
Hands up to the sky

[Chorus: Both,

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive (

Won't you rain on me? Eh, eh, yeah

I hear the thunder comin' down
Won't you rain on me? Eh, eh, yeah
Rain on me
