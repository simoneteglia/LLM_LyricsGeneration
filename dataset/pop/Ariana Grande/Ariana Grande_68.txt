[Verse 1]
How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Mm)
When you're not really there? (Hey, yeah, mm)
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in? (Ah, yeah)
Baby, just come on in (Mm, yeah)
[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
[Verse 2]
How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Ayy)
Baby, let's just forget (No-oh)
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh
[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
[Refrain]
Oh, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ain't no-bo-dy, babe)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Oh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it (Oh, no, ayy)
[Bridge]
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's be in love
[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
No, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ain't nobody gonna)
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave (Behave)
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (Ooh; Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ah-ah, ooh)
[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna (Baby)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna (Ah-ah; Woah, oh)
Baby, ain't nobody gonna (Ooh-ooh)
