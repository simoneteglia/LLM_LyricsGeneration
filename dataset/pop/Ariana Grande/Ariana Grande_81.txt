[Part I: Knew Better]
[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I see right through you, boy
And I (I) ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more)
[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause ain't nobody like me (Ain't nobody like me)
Ain't nobody like me (Ain't nobody like me)
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ayy
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby
[Part II: Forever Boy]
[Verse 1]
Mm, uh, ah
Never been with a boy more than six months
I couldn't do it, got too used to it, uh
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah, boy, they blew it
[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure, ah
[Chorus]
Oh-woah, be forever mine, you and I
Oh-woah, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
[Verse 2]
Been friends for a minute
So you know just what I like
You know my mind, nah
Even seen boys come and go
So you know what makes me cry
See, you're the one that treat me right
[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure, ah
[Chorus]
Oh-woah, be forever mine, you and I
Oh-woah, be forever mine, boy, all the time
Oh-woah, mine, time
Oh-woah, mine, time
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy
