[Intro]
Ah, hey, yeah
[Verse 1]
I know I be on some bullshit
Know I be driving you crazy
But I know you love how I whip it
You can only stay mad for a minute
So come here and give me some kisses
You know I'm very delicious
You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting
[Pre-Chorus]
I just wonder, baby, if you're gonna stay
Even if, one day, I lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy
I just wanna tell you directly
So, boy, let me know if you ready
[Chorus]
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down? Mmm
[Verse 2]
You know you be on some bullshit (Bullshit)
Act so possessive and crazy (Crazy)
But I know that's just 'causе you love me
And you ain't scared to show mе your ugly
And maybe that's just how it's supposed to be
I'm the release, you the dopamine
[Pre-Chorus]
And you wonder, baby, if I'm gonna stay
Even if one day, you lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy (Heavy)
Just wanna ask you directly (Directly)
Boy, let me know if you ready
[Chorus]
Are you down? What's up? (What's up?)
Are you down? What's up? (What's up?)
Are you down?
Are you down? (What's up?)
Are you down? (What's up?)
Are you down? (Tell me)
Are you down? (Are you gonna be)
[Post-Chorus]
Six thirty (Mmm)
Down like six thirty (Mmm)
Down like sunsets (Down like sunsets)
Down like my head on your chest (Mmm)
Down like six thirty (Ooh)
Down like six thirty (Six thirty)
Down like my foot on the gas, skrrt, skrrt
Down like six thirty, yeah
[Bridge]
What you gon' do when I'm bored
And I wanna play video games at 2 AM?
What if I need a friend? Will you ride 'til the end?
Am I enough to keep your love?
When I'm old and stuff, will you still have a crush?
[Chorus]
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? What's up?
Are you down? (Oh)
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down? (Tell me)
Are you down? (Are you gonna be)
[Post-Chorus]
Six thirty (Mmm)
Down like six thirty (Down like six thirty)
Down like sunsets (Down like sunsets)
Down like my head on your chest (Down like my head on your chest)
Down like six thirty (Ooh)
Down like six thirty (Six thirty)
Down like my foot on the gas, skrrt, skrrt
Down like six thirty, yeah
