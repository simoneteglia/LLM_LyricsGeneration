[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Pharrell

When life deals us cards (
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
)
Make everything taste like it is salt (
Ayy, ooh, ayy, ayy, ayy
)
Then you come through like the sweetener you are  (
Ayy, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy
)
To bring the bitter taste to a halt  (
Ayy, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (

Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it (

Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say, "Oh," (
Sheesh!

Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it, and mix it, and mix it, and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say, "Oh," (
Sheesh!
) "Oh" (
Sheesh!
)

So when they ask, "How's life?" (

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say, "Oh," (
Sheesh!

Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin’ you 'cause you make me say, "Oh," (
Sheesh!
) "Oh" (
Sheesh!

(
Hey
