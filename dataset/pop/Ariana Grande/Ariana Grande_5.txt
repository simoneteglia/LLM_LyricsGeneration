[Intro]
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin' (Oh, ayy), I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
[Refrain]
I'm pickin' it up (Yeah), pickin' it up (Yeah, ayy)
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up (We turnin' it up)
Yeah, we turnin' it up
[Verse 1]
Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but, boy, I like it
I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, where, who tries it
We out here vibin'
We vibin', we vibin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Can't stop so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
[Chorus]
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Oh, I just want you to come with me (Ooh)
We on another mentality
Ain't got no tears left to cry (To cry)
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up (Oh)
[Refrain]
Pickin' it up (Yeah), pickin' it up (Yeah, ayy)
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up (We turnin' it up)
Yeah (Yeah), we turnin' it up
[Verse 2]
They point out the colors in you, I see 'em too
And, boy, I like 'em
I like 'em, I like 'em
We way too fly to partake in all this hate
We out here vibin'
We vibin', we vibin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' out
Even when it's rainin' down
Can't stop now
Can't stop, so shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
And if you don't know, then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah
[Chorus]
Right now, I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in like all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
Oh, I just want you to come with me (Ooh)
We on another mentality (Oh)
Ain't got no tears left to cry (To cry)
So, I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up (Oh, yeah)
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
