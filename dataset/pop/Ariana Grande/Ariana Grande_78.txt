[Intro: Macy Gray &
Ariana Grande
]
Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Aah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger (Ooh), oh, how you hold me (Aah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby (
Ayy
), more
[Verse: Ariana Grande]
Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried? Mm
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry, and cry?
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You're a dangerous love (Ooh)
Maybe you're no good for me, darling (Aah)
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here (Ooh)
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
Ooh, you're a dangerous love, hey
[Bridge: Macy Gray]
Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Aah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger (Ooh), oh, how you hold me (Aah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby, more
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You're a dangerous love (Ooh)
Maybe you're no good for me, darling (Aah)
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here (Ooh)
Then I'd rather you leave, leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
Mm, you're a dangerous love, baby
[Outro: Macy Gray]
Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Aah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger (Ooh), oh, how you hold me (Aah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby, more
