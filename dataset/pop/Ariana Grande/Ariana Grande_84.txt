[Verse 1]
You don't need a lot of money
Honey, you don't have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin'
To get the blood rushing through my veins, oh
I wanna say we're going steady, oh
Like it's 1954
No, it doesn't have to be forever
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart
[Chorus]
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Ooh, oh (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Woah-oh-oh-oh-ah, hey
[Verse 2]
You don't need to worry about making me crazy
'Cause I'm way past that, eh
And so just call me if you want me
'Cause you got me, and I'll show you
How much I want to be on your tattooed heart
[Chorus]
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, ah (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart
[Bridge]
Wrap me in your jacket, my baby
And lay me in your bed
And kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darling, let me trace the lines on your tattooed heart
[Chorus]
(Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, oh (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Oh, babe, ah (Tattooed heart, tattooed heart)
Just as long as I'm the name on your tattooed heart
