[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Yeah
[Verse 1: Victoria Monét]
I've been on a roll, where you been?
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
Is your GPS even on, where you been?
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been
[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I swerve both ways, dichotomy
[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét &
Ariana Grande
]
I like women and men (
Yeah
)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin
How you hit the club and you barely got in?
Then we hit the bank, making them investments for the win, oh
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Said, I been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been? (Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Bad vibes, get off of me
Outta here with that fuckery
Treat my goals like property
Collect them like Monopoly
I probably won't come if there's not a fee
And if they try come stoppin' me
I show them my discography (Yeah, yeah)
[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I like women and men (Yeah)
Work so fuckin' much, need a twinny, twin, twin (Hey)
You'd be straight for life if I gave you my PIN (Yeah)
Even though we gave up that 90% for the win, go
[Verse 3: Victoria Monét &
Ariana Grande
]
I've been on a roll, where you been? (Where you been?)
Real protective with my soul, where you been?
(Where you been?)
Is your GPS even on, where you been? (Where you been?)
Matter of fact, I don't even care where you been
[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, hell nah
I don't even care where you been (Oh, yeah)
Hell nah (Oh, yeah)
Said I don't even care
[Verse 4: Victoria Monét,
Ariana Grande
&
Both
]
Remember when we made a fuckin' album off that Clicquot? (Ooh)
I never track my vocals, so shout out to Eric Vetro
(I love Eric Vetro, man)
This been buildin' up, I guess this friendship like Home Depot (Ooh)
I'm so thankful working with my best friend,
she the cheat code
She the cheat code
(Yeah)
[Outro: Victoria Monét &
Ariana Grande
]
Where you at? Where you been? (
Oh yeah
)
Where you been? Where you at, ho? Hey (
Where you been?
)
Where you at? Where you been, ho? Hey (
Mmm, yeah
)
I don't care where you been, ho (
Been
)
Where you been, Cletus?
