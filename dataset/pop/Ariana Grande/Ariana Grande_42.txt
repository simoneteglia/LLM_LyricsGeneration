Say
I'm thinkin' 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singin' in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like (Like)
Do she love me, do she love me not? (Love me not)
I ain't a player, I just—
(Player, I just—)
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away
If you want what I got, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't goin' nowhere 'cause you're a keeper
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Mac Miller
]
So don't you worry
Baby, you got me (
Ayy

I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (
Hey

You got my heart, don't know how you did it (
Hey

And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't wanna hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (
Hey
)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it; I love)
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way, the way I love you (I love it, I love it)
[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
Ooh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin'
When you put your lips on mine
And, honey, it ain't a question (Qu-qu-question)
'Cause, boy, I know just what you like
So if you need it, I got it, I got it every day
Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
Said I ain't goin' nowhere 'cause you're a keeper
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don't you worry
Baby, you got me
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (

And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't wanna hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (
Hey
