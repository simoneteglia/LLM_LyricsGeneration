[Verse 1]
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us
[Chorus]
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
[Verse 2]
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are
[Chorus]
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
[Outro]
Ooh, mm-ah, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everything
