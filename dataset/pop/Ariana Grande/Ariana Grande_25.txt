[Intro]
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
[Verse 2]
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger
[Pre-Chorus]
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy (Oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
[Post-Chorus]
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout—)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout—)
[Bridge]
Mm-mm
Ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't (Yeah)
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you (Yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
All girls wanna be like that (Mm-mm)
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside (You know how I'm feeling inside, baby)
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout—)
[Outro]
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy
(Ha)
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy
(Ha-ah-ayy)
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you)
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you, boy, oh, yeah
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout) You
