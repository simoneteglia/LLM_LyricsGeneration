[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh
[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' bout you
Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you
Oh, when I need you?
I can still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind
[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
(Mm-mm)
[Verse 2]
Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind
[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (About you, baby)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I'm thinkin' of you)
(I'm thinkin' 'bout you)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Say you know, baby, 'bout you)
[Bridge]
Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
'Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory
[Chorus]
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I do)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh; Oh, yeah)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you, 'bout you, yeah)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
