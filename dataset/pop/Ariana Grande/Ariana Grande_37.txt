[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you (Yeah)
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfеct
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh
[Chorus: Both,
Ariana Grande
,
The Weeknd
]
Even though we'rе goin' through it (
Ah
)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you (
Ooh, ooh
)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah
The distance and the time between us (
Distance and the time
)
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you (
I would die for you
)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
I'm findin' ways to stay concentrated on what I gotta do
But, baby boy, it's so hard 'round you
And yes, I'm blamin' you
And you know I can't fake it, now or never
And you insinuatin' that you think we might be better
Better me and you
Yeah, I know you do
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect (Mm)
And I know you deserve it
I can't walk away
[Chorus: Both,
Ariana Grande
,
The Weeknd
]
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you (
Me
) feel alone
Just know that I would die for you (
I would die for
you
)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind 'cause
Baby, I would die for you (
I would die for you
,
uh
)
Baby, I would die for you,
yeah
(
I would die for you
)
[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Even though we're goin' through it (Ooh)
And it makes you feel alone (No, no)
Just know that I would die for you (No)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us (Ooh)
It'll never change my mind 'cause (No, no)
Baby, I would die for you (No)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (Oh, babe)
