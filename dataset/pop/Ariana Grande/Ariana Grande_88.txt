[Verse 1]
I've been on my worst behavior
But baby, I don't need no savior
I'm way outta line
But I kind of like the way I
Feel when I just don't give a fuck
Oh, I forgot to mention
I'll be there in five
[Pre-Chorus]
We don't really need to talk too much
Show each other what we know
I got other ways to catch you up
Couldn't do it on the phone
So can you keep it secret?
[Chorus]
This ain't no game won't play with you (Oh hey)
This time I know I'll stay with you
Just promise you won't say nothin'
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe
No phone, no pics, no postin' us
This love just ain't disposable
Just take what's yours, don't run from it
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe
[Verse 2]
Said baby it's just in my nature (Oh-oh)
To be a littlе troublemaker
So wrong but so right
Know you really likе the way I
Taste when we kiss, you reminisce
But this ain't the last time
Just stay by my side
[Pre-Chorus]
We don't really need to talk too much (Too much)
Show each other what we know (Know, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I got other ways to catch you up (To catch you up)
Couldn't do it on the phone (The phone)
So can you keep it secret?
[Chorus]
This ain't no game won't play with you (Oh, babe)
This time I know I'll stay with you (Stay with you)
Just promise you won't say nothin' (Won't say nothin')
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe (Baby)
No phone, no pics, no postin' us (Postin' us)
This love just ain't disposable (Oh, babe)
Just take what's yours, don't run from it
Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe
