It's the Rascals
[Verse 1]
I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
[Verse 2]
Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin', "Baby, don't worry"
But we're still goin' the wrong way
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
[Bridge]
They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home
[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
[Outro]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in—
Traffic, I'm under
Pressure, pressure—
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Avenue
Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back
