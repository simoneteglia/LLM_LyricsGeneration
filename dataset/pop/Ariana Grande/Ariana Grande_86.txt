[Verse 1]
Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I, see right through you, boy
And I, I (Feelin' you no more)
I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more
[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ayy
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby
[Verse 2]
Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me, "If he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him"
He used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Lovin' me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time (Shit)
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (Just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight (Sheesh)
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?
[Chorus]
If you knew better
Boy, you would do better (Hey)
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better (Boy, if you knew)
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me (Oh)
Ain't nobody like me (Ain't nobody like me, yeah)
Ain't nobody like me (Sheesh)
Ain't nobody like me (Ain't nobody like me)
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby (Uh-uh)
[Outro]
Nobody like me, mm, ain't nobody like me, me
Ain't nobody like me, ayy
