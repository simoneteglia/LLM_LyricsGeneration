[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Let's go
[Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Missy Elliott

Baby, I just want you to be mine (
Woo

Won’t you give me a bit of your time? Oh, woah
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin’
Just meet me at the borderline
(
Exclusive
)
(Woo)
[Verse 1: Ariana Grande &
Missy Elliott

You play hard-to-get
But I know you want me, too (

Ain't out here looking for other dudes
So I'ma keep it tight for you (Mm)
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande &
Missy Elliott

You know I'm the wifey type

Rrah, woo

You know I be one of a kind, oh, woah
Once you tastin' my ice cream (Ice cream), I bet you won't ever leave (Ever leave)
I know it's hard to believe (Believe)
Boy, you got me all on my knees
(Light it up, though, light it up, though)
Quit playin' too hard for me
(Light it up, though, light it up, though)
Stop playin’, too hard for me (
Let’s go

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande &

Seems like I’m comin' on strong
But I don't want this time to pass (

I know you got a lot of chicks hollerin' at you
But I bet they cannot last (

Baby, I just want you to be mine, mm (

Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, woah (

Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline
[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
Uh, I'm like, you got me so on a chase
Got me feelin' so out of place
Think 'bout you all of my days
Wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes
Not tryna cuff you or crowd your space
I'm tryna find cute words just to say
"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline, beside me, you lay (Woo)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Baby, I just want you to be mine, mm
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, woah
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline
