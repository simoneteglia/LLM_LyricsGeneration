[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But, baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I’m guessing I wasn't your type, hey
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad 'cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Now that it's over (
I'm

I just wanna (
Coming

Want you to cry me a river (

You said I was your best, would be your last
Now he's gone, you're alone
Don't want you back
You're telling me you're sorry
Well, sorry, I'm over it
'Cause I've already been there done that
Ain't doing this again, no
