[Verse 1]
Said I'ma give you some instructions
That you can't be scared to try
I want you to touch it softly
Like the way you do my mind
It got body and it's smooth to touch
The same way as my skin
But don't you be scared
[Chorus]
To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
[Verse 2]
It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm
[Chorus]
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
[Bridge]
Know this ain't usually mе
But I might let it down for ya (Mmm)
This ain't usually me (Usually me)
But I might lеt it down for ya
[Chorus]
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
So come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, don't you be scared
Come run your hands through my hair
[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
