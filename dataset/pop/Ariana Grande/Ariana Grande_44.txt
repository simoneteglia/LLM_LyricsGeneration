[Intro]
Back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
[Verse 1]
I get tired of your no-shows
You get tired of my control (Yuh)
They keep telling me to let go
But I don't really let go when I say so (Yuh, yuh)
I keep giving people blank stares (Yuh)
I'm so different when you're not there (Yuh)
It's like something out of Shakespeare
Because I'm really not here when you're not there
[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy
But every time I think I'm free (Yeah)
[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
[Post-Chorus]
I go back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
[Verse 2]
Just when I get on a new wave (Yuh)
Boy, you look at me and I slip outta my lace
They keep calling me a head-case
'Cause I can't make a good case why we can't change
[Pre-Chorus]
I've tried to fight our energy (Yee)
But every time I think I'm free (Yeah)
[Chorus]
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me (Mm) back to you? (Back to you, baby)
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh, why does God keep bringing me back to you?
[Post-Chorus]
I go back to you, back to you, back to you (I go back to you)
Back to you, back to you, back to you (Back to you)
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time (I go)
I go back to you, back to you, back to you (You)
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
