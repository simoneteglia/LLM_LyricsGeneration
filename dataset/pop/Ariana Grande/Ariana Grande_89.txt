[Verse 1]
Yeah, you really tried, boy
I was blind to all the lies you told me, oh
All the shit you've done
You can't outrun the way you undersold me, hey
[Pre-Chorus]
(You) Acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
(You) Focused your frustration on a small detail
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail
[Chorus]
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye (Goodbye), goodbye (Goodbye)
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, hey
[Verse 2]
I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all
No slave to your decision, ah-ah, hey
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision
[Pre-Chorus]
(You) Used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey-ayy, yeah
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine
[Chorus]
Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye (Goodbye), goodbye (Goodbye)
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, baby
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye (Goodbye), goodbye (Goodbye)
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, hey
I'm taking it right back, baby
Taking it right back, hey
