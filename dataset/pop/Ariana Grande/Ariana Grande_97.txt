[Verse 1]
I've been living with devils and angels
Angels, angels
Realize you and I are in the same boat
Same boat, yeah
Kills me how you love me, then you cut me down
I'll do the same
We've been living like angels and devils
Devils
[Chorus]
I'm loving the pain, I never wanna live without it
So why do we try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do we try?
You got me like
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, yeah
[Verse 2]
You and I redefine being lovesick
Lovesick, lovesick
Through it all, you could still make my heart skip
Heart skip, yeah
Even when you're yelling at me
I still think you're beautiful
Through it all, you could still make my heart skip
Heart skip
[Chorus]
I'm loving the pain, I never wanna live without it
So why do we try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do we try?
You got me like
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
