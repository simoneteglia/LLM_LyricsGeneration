[Verse 1]
You on your way, it's a Friday night
Hear the rain outside, yeah
It's ros√© on ice
Candlelight and I'm feeling nice
Anything you like, boy, you know it's on me
Been a minute since I tasted something so sweet
[Pre-Chorus]
Always pull up when I call you, call you
Yeah, you never keep me waitin', waitin'
Got me trippin', I adore you
I adore you, boy (Boy)
Oh baby
[Chorus]
You, know you're really different, baby (Different, baby)
You, you might be the main thing, baby (Main thing, baby)
[Verse 2]
It's time to go, take it nice and slow
Tiptoe to the bedroom, lookin' at me like when it's cold
You gon' keep me warm
All I wanna do is spend my time with you
Even when the learning's done and nothing's new
[Pre-Chorus]
Always pull up when I call you, call you
Yeah, you never keep me waitin', waitin'
Got me trippin', I adore you
I adore you, boy (Boy)
Oh baby
[Chorus]
You, know you're really different, baby (Different, baby)
You, you might be the main thing, baby
You, know you're really different, baby (Different, baby)
You, you might be the main thing, baby (Main thing, baby)
