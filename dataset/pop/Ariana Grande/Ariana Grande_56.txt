[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows, oh
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart (Ah)
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough (Ah)
[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes &
Ariana Grande
]
If I could change the world overnight (
Ah
)
There'd be no such thing as goodbye (
Ah
)
You'd be standing right where you were (
Ah
)
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh (
Ah
)
[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes,
Ariana Grande
&
Both
]
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show (
Ah
)
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows (
Ah
)
[Chorus: Both,
Nathan Sykes
&
Ariana Grande
]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me
the way I wanted you, woah
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here
(
Right here
) in each other's arms
And we
almost,
we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
[Bridge: Ariana Grande,
Nathan Sykes
&
Both
]
Huh (
Woah
; Huh, baby), huh, baby (Mm)
You know (
You know
)
You know, baby (Huh, baby;
Huh
)
Almost (
Baby, baby, baby
) is never enough, baby
You know (Hm-hm), ooh-yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande,
Both
&
Nathan Sykes
]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause
sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is (
Truth is
) everyone knows (
Oh
)
[Chorus: Ariana Grande,
Nathan Sykes
&
Both
]
Almost (
Almost
), almost is
never enough
(Is never enough, baby)
(
We were close
) So close to being in love (So close)
If I would have known that you wanted me (
That you wanted me
)
The way I wanted you, babe
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we
almost
, we almost knew what love was (
Baby
)
But
almost is never enough
[Outro: Ariana Grande,
Both
&
Nathan Sykes
]
Huh, huh, baby (
Almost
)
You know (Hey), you know, baby (Oh)
Almost (Never)
Is never enough, baby
(Never)
You know (
Ooh
), hey
