[Intro]
Cherry, cherry, boom, boom
[Verse 1]
I can't help myself, I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke
,
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something I wanna be, retro glamour, Hollywood, yes, we live for the
[Chorus]
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune
[Post-Chorus]
Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby? A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
[Verse 2]
I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind
and whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something I wanna see, television and hot blondes in odd positions
[Chorus]
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune
[Post-Chorus]
Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby? A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
[Bridge]
Don't ask me how or why
But I'm gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen this time
Fame
Fame, doin' it for the fame
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
[Chorus]
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (
Fame
), doin' it for the fame (
Fame
)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune
(Fame)
