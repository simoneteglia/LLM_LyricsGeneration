[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
When I was young, I prayed for lightning
My mother said it would come and find me
I found myself without a prayer
I lost my love and no one cared
When I was young, I prayed for lightning
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no, nothing
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I heard one sine from above (Oh)
I heard one sine from above (Oh)
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine
[Verse 2: Elton John &
Both
]
When I was young, I felt immortal
And not a day went by without a struggle
I lived my days just for the nights
I lost myself under the lights
When I was young, I felt immortal
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Elton John]
Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no nothing
[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Elton John,
Lady Gaga
]
I heard one sine from above (
Oh
)
I heard one sine from above (
Oh
)
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Elton John]
Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine
[Bridge: Lady Gaga,
Elton John
&
Both
]
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine
[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Healed my heart
Healed my
Heart, heard a sine
Healed my
Heart, heard a sine
