[Verse 1]
Rocket number nine take off to the planet, to the planet (Venus)
Aphrodite lady, seashell bikini, garden panty (Venus)
Let's blast off to a new dimension, in your bedroom (Venus)
Aphrodite lady, seashell bikini, get with me (Venus)
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help the way I'm feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I'll keep on dancing
Goddess of love, goddess of love
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your leader (To the planet)
Your leader, your leader (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your Venus (To the planet)
Your Venus, Venus (To the planet)
[Chorus]
When you touch me, I die just a little inside
I wonder if this could be love, this could be love
'Cause you're out of this world
,
galaxy, space and time
I wonder if this could be love

Have an oyster, baby, it's Aphrod-ishy
Act sleazy (Venus)
Worship to the land, a girl from the planet
To the planet (

I can't help the way I'm feeling
Goddess of love, please take me to your leader
I can't help, I'll keep on dancing

Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your leader (To the planet)
Your leader, your leader (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your planet (To the planet)
Take me to your Venus (To the planet)
Your Venus, Venus (To the planet)

When you touch me, I die just a little inside
