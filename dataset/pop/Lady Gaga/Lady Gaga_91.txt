Hair Body Face
Hair Body Face
[Verse 1]
Your friends are in the other room
Heard every cruel thing they said
They're all just tryin' to be cool
So I wrote this song in my head
[Refrain]
I'm not mad as long
As I am perfect in your eyes
Your eyes
Doesn't make a difference yeah
As long as I am perfect in your eyes
Your eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause baby when I look at you
I just don't know what to do witchu
A man loves a triple threat
Did the party room just see that
Hair body face for ya
Triple threat
Do it for ya
Hair body face for ya
Triple threat
[Chorus]
Tryin' to leave here
But you won't let me leave
Sayin' that if I care what they think I'll never succeed
I won't leave here if you promise to me
I got the hair body face
Hair body face for you
[Post-Chorus]
Hair body face for ya
Triple threat
Do it for ya
For you
Hair body face for ya
Triple threat
Triple threat
Wasn't the "it" girl at school (not me)
No, I wasn't queen at the prom
But don't take me for a fool
Now I know I got my own charm
[Refrain]
I'm not mad
As long as I am perfect in your eyes
Your eyes
Doesn't make a difference yeah
As long as I am perfect in your eyes
Your eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause baby when I look at you
I just don't know what to do witchu
A man loves a triple threat
Did the party room just see that?
[Chorus]
Tryin' to leave here
But you won't let me leave
Sayin' that if I care what they think I'll never succeed
I won't leave here if you promise to me

Hair body face for you
[Post-Chorus]
Hair body face for ya
Triple threat
To adore ya
For you

Everything is alright way you look in my eyes
You lift me when I feel small
Triple threat I've got it all
Everything is alright way you look in my eyes
You lift me when I feel small
Hair body face

Tryin' to leave here
But you won't let me leave
Sayin' that if I care what they think I'll never succeed
I won't leave here if you promise to me
