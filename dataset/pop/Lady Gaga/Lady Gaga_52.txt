[Intro]
To tell me you need me
[Verse 1]
Hold my hand, everything will be okay
I heard from the heavens that clouds have been grey
Pull me close, wrap me in your aching arms
I see that you're hurtin', why'd you take so long
[Pre-Chorus]
To tell me you need me? I see that you're bleedin'
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end
[Chorus]
So cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise me, just hold my hand
[Verse 2]
Raise your head, look into my wishful eyes
That fear that's inside you will lift, give it time
I can see everything you're blind to now
Your prayers will be answered, let God whisper how
[Pre-Chorus]
To tell me you need me, I see that you're bleedin'
You don't need to show me again
But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
I won't let go 'til the end
[Chorus]
So cry tonight
But don't you let go of my hand
You can cry every last tear
I won't leave 'til I understand
Promise you'll just hold my hand
[Post-Chorus]
Hold my hand, hold my—
Hold my hand, hold my hand
I'll be right here, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my—
Hold my hand, hold my hand
I'll be right here, hold my hand
[Bridge]
I know you're scared and your pain is imperfect
But don't you give up on yourself
I've heard a story, a girl, she once told me
That I would be happy again
[Post-Chorus]
Hold my hand, yeah
Hold my hand, oh yeah
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand
[Outro]
I heard from the heavens
