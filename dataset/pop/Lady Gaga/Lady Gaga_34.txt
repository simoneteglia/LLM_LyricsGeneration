[Intro]
Am I, am I, am I
Am I, am I, am I
[Verse 1]
Am I still alive? Where am I? I cry
Who was it that pulled the trigger, was it you or I?
I'm completely numb, why you acting dumb?
I won't blame myself 'cause we both know you were the one
[Chorus]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
[Post-Chorus]
Replay, r-replay, eh-eh
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
[Verse 2]
Every single day, yeah, I dig a grave
Then I sit inside it, wondering if I'll behave
It's a game I play, and I hate to say
You're the worst thing and the best thing that's happened to me
[Chorus]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
[Post-Chorus]
Replay, r-replay, eh-eh
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
[Bridge]
Psychologically, it's something that I can't explain
Scratch my nails into the dirt to pull me out okay
Does it matter, does it matter? Damage is done
Does it matter, does it matter? You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun
You had the gun
[Chorus]
I don't know what to do, you don't know what to say
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay
The monster inside you is torturing me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
[Outro]
Your monsters torture me
Your monsters torture me
Your monsters torture me
The scars on my mind are on replay, r-replay, eh-eh
