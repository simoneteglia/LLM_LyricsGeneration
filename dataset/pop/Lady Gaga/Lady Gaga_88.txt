[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
You're killin' me baby with the things you do
Put me in the ground before we're through
Burnin' up this town
Spendin' everythin' I've saved
Yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave
[Verse 2: Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga]
Every little lie you tell can't keep it hid
You're just another nail on my, my coffin lid
Someone else is gettin' all the love you never gave
Woo
Yeah
And you've been out all night
Diggin' my grave, yeah
[Chorus: Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga]
So keep on runnin' around
Ain't no need to hurry back
'Cause I'll be gone from here
And you'll be all dressed up in black
Six feet under baby that's where I'll be
By the time that you're done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin' in a tidal wave
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave
[Chorus 2: Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga]
So keep on runnin' around
Ain't no need to hurry back
'Cause I'll be gone from here
And you'll be all dressed up in black
Woooo
Six feet under baby that's where I'll be
By the time that you're done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin' in a tidal wave
Yeah yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave
[Outro: Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga]
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my grave
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my
Diggin’ my, diggin’ my, diggin’ my grave
