[Verse 1]
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You want me bad
I think you're cool, but I'm not sure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Follow me, don't be such a
holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel
[Verse 2]
Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Pray for your sins right under the glass disco ball
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way
[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel
[Break]
Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Meet me, meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
(
Meet me, meet me
)
Oh, if you wanna, meet me at Electric Chapel
(
Meet me, meet me
)
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel
[Outro]
Oh
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
