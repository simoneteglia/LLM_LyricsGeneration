[Verse 1]
I want your whiskey mouth
All over my blonde south
(
Love, love
)
Red wine, cheap perfume
And a filthy pout
(
Love, love
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight bring all your friends
Because a group does it better
Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
[Verse 2]
Dirty pony
I can't wait to hose you down
(
Love, love
)
You've got to earn your leather
In this part of town
(
Love, love
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Dirty pearls and a patch
For all the Rivington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets
Drink beer and get into trouble
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
[Post-Chorus]
I could be your girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl
But would you love me
If I ruled the world, world, world?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
[Bridge]
Whip me, slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Bud Lite, liquors, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night with St.
Jame-son
Like a baptism
Heavy metal lovers play
Baby, we were born this way
[Break]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
[Post-Chorus]
I could be your girl, girl, girl (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Girl, girl, girl (Who-who-who-who)
But would you love me (Heavy metal lover)
If I ruled the world, world, world?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Heavy metal lover)
Who-who-who-who (Heavy metal lover)
