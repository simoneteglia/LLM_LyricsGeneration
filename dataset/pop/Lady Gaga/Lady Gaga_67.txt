[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa
[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
And if I'm a hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
I scream, "Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I wanna be?"
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
To be
[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair
[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
[Post-Chorus]
Free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
(
Uh-huh, uh-huh
)
A chance (
No
)
[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair
[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
[Post-Chorus]
Free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
[Bridge]
I just wanna be free, I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair (
Glory that I bare
)
I'm my hair, I am my hair
Itâ€™s all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (
All the glory that I bare
)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (
All the glory that I bare
)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (
All the glory that I bare
)
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair
[Outro]
Ooh, my hair, my hair
