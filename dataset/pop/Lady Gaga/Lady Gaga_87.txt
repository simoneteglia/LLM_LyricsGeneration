[Verse 1]
I can’t believe the things you said
Right now, I wish that you would try
Try to stay near me
Try to be near me
Before I cry
Cause I am gonna need a well
To catch the pain and lift the spell
Like you won’t hear me
Can you try and hear me?
Before I cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up hurry up (Hurry up)
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up
Woah, woah
Before I change my mind
[Chorus]
Cause I’m gonna cry if you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry
[Verse 2]
Could you please find another way?
I start to think that I'm insane
Tryin' to stay here
Let me just lay here
Before I cry
[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up hurry up (Hurry up)
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up (Hurry up)
Woah, woah
Before I change my mind
Woah woah
[Chorus]
Cause I’m gonna cry if you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care (Don't care)
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry
[Bridge]
I'm 'bout to lose it
It's got so confusin'
Am I just repeatin' myself?
Say somethin' lovin' to me before I crumble
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
[Chorus]
Cause I’m gonna cry if you say you don’t need me
I’m gonna cry if you act like you don’t care (Don't care)
Promise me, baby, you know I can’t fake it
Why don’t you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry
Before I cry
[Outro]
Have I said what I needed to say?
Have you said what you wanted to say?
Did you say what you wanted to say?
Would you try and stop me
Before I cry?
