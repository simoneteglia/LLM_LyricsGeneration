[Verse 1]
Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another (
Not another word from you
)
You're just an animal
,
tryna act real special (
But deep down you are just a shrew
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine
[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
[Post-Chorus]
Swine, swine
Swine, swine
[Drop]
Swine!
Swine!
[Verse 2]
Be that hog, sweat it out, you squealer (
Let your body jiggle
)
Slap her skin, he loves to watch your ass go wiggle
(
It's the thrill of ecstasy
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine
[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
[Post-Chorus]
Swine, swine
Swine, swine
[Drop]
Swine!
[Outro]
Paint your face and
Paint his face and (Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Paint her face and (Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Be a swine just (Catch the beat)
For the weekend
Catch the beat
C-catch the beat
C-catch the beat
C-catch the beat
Swine!
