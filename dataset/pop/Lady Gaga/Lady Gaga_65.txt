[Intro]
I met a girl in East LA
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords
We fell in love
But not in court
[Interlude]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I don't s—
I don't s—
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, América
Americano
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, América
Americano
[Verse 1]
Mis canciones son de la revolución
Mi corazón me duele por mi generación
If you love me, we can marry, on the West Coast
On a Wednesday, en un verano, en agosto
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't speak your
I don't speak your language, oh no (
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
)
I don't speak your (
Don't speak your
)
I don't speak your (
Won't speak your
) Jesús Cristo (
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
I will fight for, I have fought for how I love you (
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
)
I have cried for, I will die for how I care (
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
)
In the mountains, las campanas están sonando (
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
)
Todos los chicos (
Chicas
), y los chicos (
Chicas
)
Se están besando
(
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
)
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't speak your
I don't speak your language, oh no (

I don't speak your (
Don't speak your

I don't speak your (
Won't speak your
) Jesús Cristo (
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
)
I don't speak your (
Won't speak your

I don't speak your (
Won't speak your

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
)
I don't speak your (
Won't speak your

[Outro]
Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to catch me, no, no, no, no
I'm living on the edge of
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law
Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to get me, no, no, no, no
Don't you try to catch me
Living on the edge of the law, law, law, law
