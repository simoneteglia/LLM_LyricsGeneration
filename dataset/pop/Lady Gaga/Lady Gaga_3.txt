Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance

Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la
Want your bad romance
[Verse 1]
I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love, ayy
I want your drama, the touch of your hand (
Hey
)
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
(Love, love, love, I want your love)
[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance
[Chorus]
I want your love and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance (Oh)
I want your love and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance
[Refrain]
Ra, ra, ah-ah-ah
Roma, roma-ma

[Verse 2]
I want your horror, I want your design
'Cause you're a criminal as long as you're mine
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
I want your psycho, your vertigo schtick (
Hey
)
Want you in my rear window, baby, you're sick
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
(Love, love, love, I want your love)
[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I want you
And you know that I need you ('Cause I'm a free bitch, baby)
I want it bad, your bad romance
[Chorus]
I want your love and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance (Oh)
I want your love and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance

[Interlude]
Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that bitch crazy
Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that bitch crazy
Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that bitch crazy
Walk, walk, passion, baby
Work it, I'm a free bitch, baby
[Bridge]
I want your love and I want your revenge
I want your love, I don't wanna be friends
Je veux ton amour et je veux ta revanche
Je veux ton amour, I don't wanna be friends (Oh)
(I want your bad romance, I want your bad romance)
No, I don't wanna be friends (Caught in a bad romance)
(I want your bad romance, I want your bad romance)
I don't wanna be friends (Oh)
(I want your bad romance, I want your bad romance)
Want your bad romance (I want your bad romance)
Caught in a bad romance

Oh (Want your bad romance)
Caught in a bad romance
