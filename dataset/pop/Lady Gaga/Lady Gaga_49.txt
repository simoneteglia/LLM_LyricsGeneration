[Intro]
Am I E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I
Am I pl-plastic?
Pl-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
Pl-plastic, technologic
[Verse 1]
Open me up and cut me loose
I come with a purse and new shoes
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
I've lived in a pink box so long
I am top shelf, they built me strong
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've spent too long
Dancing all alone
Dancing to the same song
I'm no toy for a real boy
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
If you're a real boy
[Chorus]
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
[Verse 2]
I've got blonde hair and cherry lips
I'm state of art, I'm microchipped
Am I your type? Am I your type?
(Ooh la la, oh la la, ooh, ooh, ooh la la)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've spent too long
Dancing all alone
Dancing to the same song
I'm no toy for a real boy
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
If you're a real boy
[Chorus]
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll (Ooh la la)
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
[Bridge]
Tell me, who dressed you? Where'd you get that hat?
Why is she cryin'? What's the price tag?
Who's that girl, Malibu Gaga?
Looks so sad, what is this saga? (Oh)
[Chorus]
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
Don't play with me
It just hurts me
I'm bouncin' off the walls
No, no, no, I'm not your plastic doll
(Your plastic doll)
[Outro]
Am I E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I
Pl-plastic? (Plastic)
Pl-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
Pl-plastic, technologic (Plastic)
Am I E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I (I'm not your plastic doll)
Pl-plastic?
Pl-plastic do-o-o-o-oll
Pl-plastic, technologic (Ooh la la)
