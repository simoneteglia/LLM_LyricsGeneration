[Spoken]
"I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro"
[Interlude]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you
[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose
[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Roberto
[Post-Chorus]
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
[Spoken]
"Stop, please
Just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go"
[Verse 2]
She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that
Burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad
[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose
[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Roberto
[Post-Chorus]
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
[Bridge]
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Fernando
[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Roberto
[Post-Chorus]
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
(Don't call my name, don't call my name) Alejandro, Alejandro
(Alejandro)
(I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe) Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
(Fernando)
(Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch) Alejandro, Alejandro
(Just smoke my cigarette and hush)
(Don't call my name, don't call my name) Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
(Roberto)
[Outro]
Alejandro
