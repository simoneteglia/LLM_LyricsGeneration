[Intro: Lady Gaga]
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breakin' up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone (Won't)
Won't make me leave no faster (Pu-put)
Put my coat on faster (Le-leave)
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
[Bridge: Lady Gaga,
Beyoncé

It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringin'
Sometimes I feel like I live in

Can call all you want but there's no one home
