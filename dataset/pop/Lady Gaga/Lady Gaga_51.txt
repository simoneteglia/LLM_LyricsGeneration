[Verse 1]
I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same (Oh)
In life, waiting's just a stupid game (Oh)
[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
[Verse 2]
I'd do anything for you to really see me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever say (Oh)
Each time, your love seems to save the day (Oh)
[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves
Oh (Doves)
[Bridge]
I've been hurting, stuck inside a cage
So hard my heart's been in a rage
If you love me, then just set me free
And if you don't, then baby, leave
Set me free
[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
[Post-Chorus]
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
A thousand do-o-o-o-o-oves (Flying, flying)
Oh (Flying like a thousand doves)
Flying, flying, flying like a thousand doves
Flying, flying, flying (Doves)
