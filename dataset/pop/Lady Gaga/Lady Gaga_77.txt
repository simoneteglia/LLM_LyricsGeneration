[Verse 1]
Treat me like your patient
Just don't keep me waiting
Or I'll just be wasted
In a crowd of the lonely
I need you to inspire me
When I can't inspire myself
I need you to provide for me
When I feel like someone else
[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down
[Chorus]
Heal me
God knows nothin' else is gonna
Gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won’t you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ahah
[Verse 2]
Dose me with your energy
Leave your soul inside of me
Cool me down and calm me
Ring me, don't alarm me
[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down
[Chorus]
Heal me
God knows nothin' else is gonna
Gonna heal me
Ooh before it's too late
Won’t you steal me
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ah-ah
Heal me ahah
[Bridge]
I wanna be more or equal, not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed
I wanna be more or equal not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed
[Chorus]
Heal me
God knows nothin' else is gonna
Gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah-ah
Heal me, ah-ah
Heal me ah-ah
