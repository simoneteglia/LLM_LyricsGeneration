[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
[Interlude]
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
R-r-r-r-run w-w-w-with
[Verse 1]
Run run, with her top down, baby, she flies
Run run, with the fury of a saint in her eyes
Run run, ha-cha cha cha, baby, she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes
[Pre-Chorus]
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, tonight
[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
[Post-Chorus]
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
[Verse 2]
She's just an American, riding a dream
When she's got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
She don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a free soul burning roads, with a flag in her bra
[Pre-Chorus]
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, tonight
[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love
[Post-Chorus]
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
[Bridge]
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die
