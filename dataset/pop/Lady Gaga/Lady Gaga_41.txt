[Verse 1]
Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Tryin' to figure out the world
It felt like summer when I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story but tell me again
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am
[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
[Verse 2]
I hope you’re still with me
When I’m not quite myself
And I pray that you’ll lift me
When you know I need help
It’s a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story of our fairytale
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Family dinners and family trees
Teachin' the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right
[Chorus]
I want you
To look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me
To be by my side
I want you
At the end of my life
Wanna see your face
When I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
[Outro]
Is that alright?
