[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I might be messed up
But I know what's love
You want a real taste
At least I'm not a fake
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
I'll show you what's me
Close your eyes, don't peek
Now I'm undressing
Unwrap sour candy
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
Come on, sour candy (Oh)
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside
[Refrain: Rosé,

I'm sour candy
So sweet 'til I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
