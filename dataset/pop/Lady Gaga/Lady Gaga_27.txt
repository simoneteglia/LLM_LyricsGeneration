[Intro]
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
[Interlude]
Huh!
Huh!
[Verse 1]
I wanna kiss you (Huh!)
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe (Huh!)
It's complicated and stupid (Huh!)
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play (Huh!)
A love game, a love game (Huh!)
[Refrain]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart
To quit it
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
[Chorus]
Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)
Dans the love game
Let's play a love game, play a love game (Huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)
Dans the love game
[Interlude]
Huh!
Huh!
[Verse 2]
I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A love game, a love game
[Refrain]
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart
To quit it
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick (Huh!)
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick (Huh!)
[Chorus]
Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)
Dans the love game
Let's play a love game, play a love game (Huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)
Dans the love game
[Interlude]
Huh!
Huh!
[Bridge]
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your (Huh!)
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a huh!
And a game (Huh!)
[Break]
And a game (Huh!)
And a game (Huh!)
And a game (Huh!)
A love game!
[Chorus]
Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)
Dans the love game
Let's play a love game, play a love game (Huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)
Dans the love game (Huh!)
Let's play a love game, play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)

Dans the love game

Let's play a love game, play a love game (Huh!)
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game? (Huh!)
(Don't think too much, just bust that kick)
Dans the love game

Huh!
Dans the love game
