[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
[Refrain]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
[Verse 1]
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me
[Pre-Chorus]
(
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
)
I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
(
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
)
A king with no crown
King with no crown
[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
[Refrain]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
[Verse 2]
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body
[Pre-Chorus]
(
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
)
I'll bring him down
Bring him down, down
(
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
)
A king with no crown
King with no crown
[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
[Breakdown]
Ew
[Verse 3]
In the most Biblical sense
(
Ew
)
I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offenced
Or wear ear condom next time
[Bridge]
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to
[Chorus]
Just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh-oh)
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-whoa (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)
[Refrain]
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
