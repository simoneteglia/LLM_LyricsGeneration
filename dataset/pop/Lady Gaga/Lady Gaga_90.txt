[Intro]
We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom
[Verse 1]
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
'Til they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)
[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure
[Verse 2]
I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face, I'm absurd
I'm so bad
And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)
[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure
[Bridge]
I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that "cool and you hate me"
I'm a bad kid, that's the way that they made me
I'm a bad kid, I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
One of the bad kids don't know wrong from right
[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
[Outro]
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
