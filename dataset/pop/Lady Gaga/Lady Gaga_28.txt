[Verse 1]
We only have the weekend
You can serve it to me, ancient-city style
We can party like it's B.C
.
With a pretty sixteenth-century smile
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you and me
That's gossip
[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
[Post-Chorus]
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon (Battle for your life)
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
[Verse 2]
Bodies moving like a sculpture (Ooh)
On the top of Tower of Babel tonight
We are climbing up to Heaven (Heaven)
Speak in languages in a BloodPop® moonlight
[Pre-Chorus]
It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you, and me
That's gossip (That's gossip)
[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
[Post-Chorus]
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon (Battle for your life)
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Battle for your life, Babylon
[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
[Outro]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
