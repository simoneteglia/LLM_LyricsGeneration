[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah
It's about that time, yeah, haha
Time to take off, partner, alright?
Hustle Gang, uh-huh, G-D-O-D
Get your doe or die, partner
Yup, leggo (Ayy)
[Verse 1: T.I.]
Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands, and bills
Came up from 'round, that's a Dandiville
They finna do a deal, about 60 mil'
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrate
You wasn't really trappin', servin' birds of yay
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a O of every day
'Round my way, cats get murder planned
Ain't no rules, play dirty, man
Put somethin' through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E
G-G-G-A-N-G, yeah, that way
Just pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go and ask Gaga
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it comin', I'm comin' around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Everybody want that money, what you want?
High as hell, tryna have some fuckin' fun
I don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine (Shine)
Tried to kick it, just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passin' 'em freaks (Bitch)
[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money
[Verse 4: Twista]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
And I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by givin' money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin' her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista be goin' in warp speed, breakin' atoms
Blowin' O.G. has got me
creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me, now I got her
Because she be ready to party and then move to the club (Yes)
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talkin' about jewels and drugs
[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin; if it ain't family
We know how to make that money
