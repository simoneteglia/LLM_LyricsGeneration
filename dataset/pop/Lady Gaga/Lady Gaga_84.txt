[Intro: Jennie]
Sou-sour candy
(Sou-sour candy)
[Chorus: Jennie &
Lisa
]
I'm sour candy
So sweet then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Rosé,
Jisoo
&
Jennie
&
Lady Gaga
]
Ask me to be nice and then I'll do it extra mean
'Cause it don't really matter, yeah
We know we'll get the streams
Inside got a heart of gold
But no, don't tell the streets, nah nah
If you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now
But if you wanna win me then let's make up, not fall down
So tell me that I'm special
When I walk in you say wow
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Oh)
[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
I might be messed up
But I know what's up
You want a real taste
At least I'm not a fake
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
I'll show you what's me
Close your eyes, don't peek
Now I'm undressing
Unwrap sour candy
Come, come, unwrap me
Come, come, unwrap me
Come on, sour candy
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
I'm hard on the outside
But if you see inside, inside, inside
[Chorus: Rosé &
Lisa
]
I'm sour candy
So sweet then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Take a bite, take a bite
S-sour candy (Sour candy)
Take a bite, take a bite (Uh)
S-sour candy
Take a bite, take a bite
S-sour candy (Sour candy)
Take a bite, take a bite (Uh)
Sour candy
