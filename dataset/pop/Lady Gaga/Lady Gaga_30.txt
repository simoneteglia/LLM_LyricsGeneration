[Intro]
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)
[Verse 1]
Could you pull me out of this alive?
(Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah)
Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
(Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh ma-ma-ma, oh ma-ma-ma)
I'm tired of screaming
(Oh-ma-ma-ma, oh-ma-ma-ma)
At the top of my lungs
(Oh my mother, oh my mother)
I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down
So down, down
[Chorus]
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
[Post-Chorus]
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
[Verse 2]
Sick and tired of waking up
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Think I might've just left myself behind
Maestro, play me your symphony
I will listen to anything
Take me on a trip, DJ, free my mind
[Chorus]
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
My name isn't Alice
But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
[Post-Chorus]
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
Take me home
Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, oh (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)
Ah, ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, ah, oh (Ah)
Set me free (Ah-ah-ah)
