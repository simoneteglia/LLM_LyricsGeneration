[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I don't know what love is
If I can't have you here
I don't know what love is
I think that it's just fear
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
I don't know the tempo
Of my heart's concerto
It all seems like a dream
It's not
I know there's something real out there for me
[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue, every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you
[Verse 3: Bradley Cooper]
If I had the courage
I'd know just what to do
Sometimes I have to crawl
And everyday I fall
Tryin' just to stand by you
[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue, every color I choose
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you
