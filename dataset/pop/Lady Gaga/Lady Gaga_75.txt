[Verse 1]
Why do you look so good in those jeans?
Why'd you come around me with an ass like that?
You're makin' all my thoughts obscene
This is not, not like me
Why you keep on texting me like that? (Damn)
Got other things I need my mind on, yeah
Other responsibilities
This is not, not like me
[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
[Post-Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
[Verse 2]
Boy could you please stop bein' so fine
When I stare at you, I wish I were blind
'Cause I begin to lose control
No I can't, can't let go
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause ever since I met you
I've been prayin' on my knees
That you would always stay around
That you would never leave
But I'm the kind of girl that always needs to be free
Why did you do that to me?
[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
[Post-Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that? (Do that)
[Bridge]
I can't stop talkin' 'bout what you do to me
You keep keepin' me from how I'm supposed to be
To be
[Chorus]
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me?
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that
Do that to me (Oh why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that (Why?)
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?
[Post-Chorus]
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
