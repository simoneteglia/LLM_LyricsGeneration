[Verse 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
,
I wonâ€™t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
,
live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark, gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness, I'm a winner
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore
[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna lace up my boots, throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love, in my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar, but I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high, kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore
[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
[Bridge]
Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love
Come on and run
Turn the car on and run
[Chorus 2]
I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
Leave nothing on these streets to explore
[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry (Marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night (The night)
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry (Marry, marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night (The night)
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
[Outro]
I'm gonna marry, marry
I'm gonna marry, marry
C'mon, c'mon
The night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night (Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
