[Verse 1]
Midnight rush with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln, sanskrit with a fan
Rememberin' me before we began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
But the ones who loved me told me to stop
Like, "Homegirl can't catch shit if it drop"
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
[Chorus]
Don't want no
paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want any paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
[Verse 2]
Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart
I’ve heard it before, yeah, the dinners were nice
'Til your diamond words melted into some ice
You shoulda been rappin' to the beat of my song
Mr. California, paper ganster-a
I'm lookin' for love, not an empty page
Full of stuff that means nothin' but "you’ve been played"
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
[Chorus]
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta)
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta, gangsta)
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
