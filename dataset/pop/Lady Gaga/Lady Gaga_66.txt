[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
You're music to my eyes
I had to listen just to find you
I like for you to let me sing along
Give you a rhythm you feel
[Pre-Chorus: Bradley Cooper]
I wanna learn your every line
I wanna fill your empty spaces
I want to play the part to reach your heart
Sing you a song that you feel
[Chorus: Bradley Cooper]
Love let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize
Let your melodies fly in my direction
Take me to your paradise
On a musical ride
I'm in love with your music baby
You're music to my eyes
[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Your voice is quite a view
I heard a song and then I saw you
I learned the lyrics and knew you were mine
Dance the horizon with you
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I wanna sing you a sunrise
And be the dawn I know will move you
I'd like to be the strings on your guitar
Touch me and play what you feel
[Chorus: Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga]
Love let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize
Let your melodies fly in my direction
Take me to your paradise
On a musical ride
I'm in love with your music baby
You're music to my eyes
