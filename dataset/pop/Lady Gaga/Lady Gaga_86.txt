[Intro]
Ooh, la-la-la
[Verse 1]
I am, I'm too fabulous
I'm so fierce that it's so nuts
I live to be model thin
Dress me, I'm your mannequin
[Pre-Chorus]
J'adore, Vivienne, habillez-moi
Gucci, Fendi et Prada
Valentino, Armani too
Merde, I love them Jimmy Choo
[Chorus]
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la-la-la
We love designer
[Verse 2]
I need some new stilettos
Can't walk down the street in those
You are who you wear, it's true
A girl's just as hot as the shoes she choose
[Pre-Chorus]
J'adore, Weitzman, habillez-moi
Louis, Dolce Gabbana
Alexander McQueen, eh-oh
Merde, I love those Manolo
[Chorus]
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, la-la-la
We love designer
Ooh, la-la-la
We love designer
[Chorus]
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
Fashion, put it all on me
Don't you wanna see these clothes on me?
Fashion, put it all on me
I am anyone you want me to be
