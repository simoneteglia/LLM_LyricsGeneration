[Intro]
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
Let's love
[Verse 1]
I will never leave your side, my love
Standing right beside you is enough
Count on me if you feel any pain
Call to me, I'll run to you again
[Pre-Chorus]
You can count on me
And I can count on you
You show up, like I show up
And I'll keep showing up for you
[Chorus]
So take my hand, don't be afraid
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
I swear you're safe
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
This too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
[Post-Chorus]
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Let's love
[Verse 2]
I will never leave your side, my love
Standing right beside you is enough
[Pre-Chorus]
You can count on me, uh-huh
I can count on you
You show up for me
I show up for you
And I'll keep showing up for you
[Chorus]
So take my hand, don't be afraid
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
I swear you're safe
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
This too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
[Post-Chorus]
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
[Outro]
Let's love, let's love
Let's love, let's love
