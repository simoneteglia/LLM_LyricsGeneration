[Verse 1]
Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love, no time for hate
No drama, no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony
Oh
[Chorus]
I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
[Verse 2]
Tough girl, I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top, blackouts and airplanes
And I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony
Oh
[Chorus]
I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
[Bridge]
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
I wake up
alone
[Chorus]
I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
