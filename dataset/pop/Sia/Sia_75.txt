[Verse 1]
You terrify me 'cause you're a man, and not a boy
You got some power, and I can't treat you like a toy
You're the road less traveled by a little girl
You disregard the mess, while I try to control the world
Don't leave me, stay here and frighten me
Don't leave me, come now, enlighten me
Give me all you got, give me your wallet and your watch
Give me your first-born, give me the rainbow and the...
[Pre-Chorus]
So go and challenge me, take the reins and see
Watch me squirm, baby, you are just what I need
[Chorus]
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
[Verse 2]
You terrify me, we've still not kissed and yet I've cried
You got too close and I pushed and pushed hoping you'd bite
So I could run, run and that I did but through the dust
You saw those teeth marks, they weren't all yours
You had been thrust into a history
That had not worked for me
Into a history, from which I could not flee
So go on, shake me, shake until I give it up
Wearin' me down, baby, I know that we could make some love
[Pre-Chorus]
So go and challenge me, take the reins and see
Watch me squirm, baby, you are just what I need
[Chorus]
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
[Interlude]
[Chorus - Variation]
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
No, I've never played a fair game
(I've always had the upper hand)
But what good is intellect and airplay
(If I can't respect any man)
And I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
