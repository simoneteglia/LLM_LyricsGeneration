[Verse 1]
I've got a crush, la la la la la la
Like a school girl
And I wanna rush, la la la la la la
Like a fool would
So, step on the gas, la la la la la la
Come on over
'Cause babe it's Christmas, la la la la la la
I wanna know ya
[Pre-Chorus]
Run to me, run to me through the white night
'Cause I adore ya
Run to me, run to me through the white night
I'm waiting for ya
[Chorus]
It's Christmas time, so run for your life
Oh, Hallelujah
A snowy night, a woman on fire
I'm waiting for ya
So, here we go under the mistletoe
Oh, I adore ya
A snowy night, a woman on fire
Oh, Hallelujah
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
Under the mistletoe
Oh, you and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
Under the mistletoe
[Verse 2]
Kiss me 'til dawn, la la la la la la
Hold me close now
You'll keep me warm, la la la la la la
Keep the ghosts out
[Pre-Chorus]
Run to me, run to me through the white night
'Cause I adore ya
Run to me, run to me through the white night
I'm waiting for ya
[Chorus]
It's Christmas time, so run for your life
Oh, Hallelujah
A snowy night, a woman on fire
I'm waiting for ya
So, here we go under the mistletoe
Oh, I adore ya
A snowy night, a woman on fire
Oh, Hallelujah
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, you and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
Under the mistletoe
Oh, you and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
You and me here, underneath the mistletoe (Oh)
Under the mistletoe
