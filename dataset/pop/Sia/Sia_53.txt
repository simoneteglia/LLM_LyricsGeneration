[Verse 1]
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me
,
leave you blind
My love, you have found peace
You were searching for relief
[Pre-Chorus]
You gave it all
Gave in to the call
You took a chance and
You took the fall for us
You came thoughtfully
Loved me faithfully
You taught me honor
You did it for me
[Chorus]
Tonight, you will sleep for good
You will wait for me, my love
[Post-Chorus]
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole
[Verse 2]
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me
,
leave you blind
My love, look what you can do
I am mending, I'll be with you
[Pre-Chorus]
You took my hand
Added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me
You loved honestly
Gave what you could release
Oh
[Chorus]
I know in peace you'll go
I hope relief is yours
[Post-Chorus]
Now I am strong (Now I am strong)
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole
[Bridge]
My love
Beat inside me
[Outro]
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, I'll be with you
Ooh, ooh
Do-do-do, ooh
