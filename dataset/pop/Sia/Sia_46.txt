[Verse 1: G. Stöltzing]
Hello
My name is Mr. Fear
I wish I had a faster therapy
I've come
To mind control your needs
Tonight I'm gonna star all of your leads
[Chorus: G. Stöltzing and Tish]
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming near
[Verse 2: G. Stöltzing]
How long
You'll call me insincere?
I'm not here to fulfill your parody
How come
My song becomes unreal?
You never understand my melody
[Chorus: G. Stöltzing and Tish]
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming you know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't fight with me, my dear
Why can't I be in here?
[Bridge: Tish]
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm so alone
I know is not real
But is in my soul
And I just can try to face
The dark inside my head
(Fear no more the heat o' the sun, nor the furious winter's rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:
Golden lads and girls all must
As chimney sweepers, come to dust.)
[Chorus: G. Stöltzing and Tish]
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming you know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't trust in me my dear
What cure is coming near?
