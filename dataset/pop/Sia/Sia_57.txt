[Verse 1]
Under the moonlight within your warm embrace
I feel so safe here, baby, you were worth the wait (Oh-oh)
I picked the wrong kind, time after time
I drank from the poisoned wine (Oh-oh)
Yeah, I picked the wrong kind, but baby, you're alright
Baby, I've seen the light
[Pre-Chorus]
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming, oh (Oh)
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here (Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze (Oh-oh)
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe (Oh-oh)
One million bullets could come my way (Oh-oh)
But I want you to know that I'd take a million, babe
[Post-Chorus]
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
'Cause I'd take
one million bullets, babe
[Verse 2]
If you were a poet and I was a faultless muse (Oh-oh)
If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you (Oh-oh)
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have (Oh-oh)
'Cause I'd give my life for one of your belly laughs (Oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
But I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming, oh (Oh)
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here (Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze (Oh-oh)
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe (Oh-oh)
Yeah, one million bullets should come my way (Oh-oh)
But I want you to know that I'd take a million, babe
[Post-Chorus]
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
'Cause I'd take
one million bullets, babe
