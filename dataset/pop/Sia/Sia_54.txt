[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
I'd fallen through the floor again,
crashed into the basement
The pain was swallowing me
I was like a lead balloon, I couldn't even get up to turn the lights on
The dark is swallowing me
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
I was breaking down, and I saw
[Chorus]
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
[Verse 2]
Oh, I forgot the things I knew, it was I who'd abandoned you
Forgive me, I was lost in doubt
You had never left my side, picked me up when I thought I would die
You held me and I was found
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
And I'm breaking down
[Chorus]
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
