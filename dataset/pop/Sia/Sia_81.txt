[Verse 1]
You're dark gray like a storm cloud
Swelling up with rage that is desperate to be let out
And I know it's a heavy load
Carrying those tears around
Carrying those fears around
Worry makes the world go 'round
[Verse 2]
You're twisted up like a slip knot
Tied by a juicehead who just took his t shot
,
and I know
There's a hungry dog tugging at your frayed ends
But he's just playing with you, he just wants to be your friend
[Pre-Chorus]
So don't worry, don't worry I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight
[Chorus]
Yesterday is gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)
[Verse 3]
Eyes stingin' from the black smoke, new hope
Loose rope
, risen from the undertow
All is well
We welcome the cry of the dark night sky
Swallow me peacefully, follow my heart back inside
[Pre-Chorus]
So don't worry, don't worry I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight
[Chorus]
Yesterday is gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)
[Bridge]
Don't worry, don't worry I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight
[Chorus]
Yesterday's gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook (oh)
