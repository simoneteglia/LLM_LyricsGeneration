[Verse 1]
Put on my best dress, I wanted to impress
I put a little makeup on
Put a bow in my hair, wore pretty underwear
Hoping you might take it off
Don't know your etiquette but
I'm strapped to my chair, and it ain't 'cause you're pretty
You were charming, until
You saw your chance to kill, your chance to make history
[Chorus]
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
[Verse 2]
My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess
Boy, you and your promises
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss
Now you'll just have memories
[Chorus]
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
[Bridge]
Boy, you draw me back in
I'm hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word
[Chorus]
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
You wonder why you make girls cry
