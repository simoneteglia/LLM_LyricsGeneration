[Verse 1]
I don't like to wait too long, to wait too long, wait too long
Bring it on and bring it strong, bring it, baby
I feel the pain and it feels good, I knew it would
Your heart burns through, I feel the pain and I cry out, cry out
[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, I need you
[Chorus]
Babe, I'm gonna drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
Boy, I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
[Verse 2]
So take me to the heavens now
As we burn down, as we are found
Take me to the heavens now
My heart screams out
[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, I need you
[Chorus]
Babe, I'm gonna drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
Boy, I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
[Bridge]
Love me to the beat of a drum
To the beat of a drum, yeah
Love me, till the walls cave in, yeah
Love me, to the beat of a drum
To the beat of a drum, yeah
Love me, I don't want saving
[Chorus]
Babe, I'm gonna drink you in
Like oxygen, like oxygen
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
Boy, I'm going up in flames
And you're to blame
Yeah, you're to blame
Baby, I'm a house on fire
And I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
I wanna keep burning
Baby, I'm a house on fire
