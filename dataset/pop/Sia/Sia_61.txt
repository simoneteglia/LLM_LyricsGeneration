[Intro]
Thong, th-thong, thong, thong
Thong, th-thong, thong, thong
Thong, th-thong, thong, thong
[Pre-Chorus]
“Thong Song,” I'ma bring the part two
G'donk, G'donk, I'ma make you blush, fool
My junk, hypnotize the whole room
Bump, bump, I'ma rub it up on you
My peach, juicy soft and so delicious
My seat is here to bring your wicked wishes
True love, come on baby turn it up
My curves are ready, ain't you heard enough?
[Chorus]
News travels fast when you got an ass like my sweet design
Baby got back
, I'ma clap that
It's a man trap
I'ma move it to the high hat
Watch my sweet design
Thong, th-thong, thong, thong
[Pre-Chorus]
“Thong Song,” I'ma bring the part two
G'donk, G'donk, I'ma make you blush fool
My junk, hypnotize the whole room
Bump, bump, I'ma rub it up on you
My peach, juicy soft and so delicious
My seat is here to bring your wicked wishes
True love, come on baby turn it up
My curves are ready, ain't you heard enough?
[Chorus]
News travels fast when you got an ass like my sweet design
Baby got back,
I'ma clap that
It's a man trap
I'ma move it to the high hat
Watch my sweet design

Thong, th-thong, thong, thong

News travels fast when you got an ass like my sweet design
Baby got back

I'ma move it to the high hat
Watch my sweet design (Thong, th-thong, thong, thong)
News travels fast when you got an ass like my sweet design
Baby got back

It's a man trap
I'ma move it to the high hat
Watch my sweet design
