[Verse 1: Stöltz]
Tell her when it rains
I don't feel it
Tell her I'm to blame
Didn't see it
[Bridge: Stöltz]
Winter's snows
Don't hide my woes
I can't lie to you
I tried to warn her that sometimes we fall in the dark
[Chorus: Stöltz &
Barbie Williams
]
It's summer time
Singing Al Green in your car
Heading to a party
And the night air feels alive
[Verse 2:
Barbie Williams
]
Just sitting here
I'm waiting, oh yeah
And he's not by my side
Feeling dazed and I can't get him out
Stuck in yesterday
[Bridge:
Barbie Williams
]
He don't know it
I rarely showed it
I can't lie to you
I tried to warn him that sometimes we fall in the dark
[Chorus:
Stöltz & Barbie Williams
, Stöltz]
It's summer time
Singing Al Green in your car
Heading to a party
And the night air feels alive
But in my life
I never meant to cause no harm
Never hurt nobody
Just wanna take this chance to fly
On this summer night
[Outro:
Barbie Williams
]
But in my life
I never meant to cause no harm
Never hurt nobody
Just wanna take this chance to fly
