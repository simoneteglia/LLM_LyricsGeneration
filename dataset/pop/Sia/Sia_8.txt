[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm batshit crazy havin' you on my mind?
Do you think I'm helpless?
My algebra gon' equal you every time
Do you think I'm callin'?
Do you think I'm callin' out your name every night?
Girl, I have fallen for you

Put your arm 'round my neck while I am walkin'
Please understand
