[Verse 1]
Oh, father time
You and me and holiday wine
Wait for the snow
I will read the list that I wrote
[Refrain]
Sitting by the open fire
Lovin' you's a gift tonight
Lovin' you for all my life
Lovin' you is a gift tonight
[Chorus]
Oh, everyday is Christmas when you're here with me
I'm safe in your arms, you're my angel, baby
Everyday is Christmas when you're by my side
You're the gift that keeps givin', my angel for life
Everyday is Christmas, everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side
Everyday is Christmas, everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side
[Verse 2]
Oh, you're my love
You're the joy in my holiday song
And when you smile, I can't breathe
Can't believe that you're mine
[Refrain]
Sitting by the open fire
Lovin' you's a gift tonight
Lovin' you for all my life
Lovin' you is a gift tonight
[Chorus]
Oh, everyday is Christmas when you're here with me
I'm safe in your arms, you're my angel, baby
Everyday is Christmas when you're by my side
You're the gift that keeps givin', my angel for life
Everyday is Christmas, everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side
Everyday is Christmas, everyday is Christmas
Everyday is Christmas with you by my side
