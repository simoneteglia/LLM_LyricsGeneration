[Verse 1]
Come along, it is the break of day
Surely now you'll have some things to say
It's not the time for telling tales on me
[Pre-Chorus]
So come along, it won't be long till we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt; tomorrow we'll be free, yeah
[Chorus]
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
[Verse 2]
Well, it's been rough but we'll be just fine
We'll work it out, yeah, we'll survive
You mustn't let a few bad times dictate
[Pre-Chorus]
So come along, it won't be long till we return happy
Shut your eyes, there are no lies in this world we call sleep
Let's desert this day of hurt; tomorrow we'll be free, yeah
[Chorus]
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
[Bridge]
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
[Chorus]
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
(I know we're lost but soon we'll be found)
[Outro]
(Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?)
I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
(Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say)
I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
(Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found)
I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
(I know we're lost but soon we'll be found)
Yeah
(Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight?)
I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
(Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say)
I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
(Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found)
I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
(I know we're lost but soon we'll be found)
(Let's not fightâ€¦)
