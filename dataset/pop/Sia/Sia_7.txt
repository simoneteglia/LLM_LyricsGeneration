Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make up on

'Til I hit the dance floor (
Bada bang

No, I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby
(
Just you and me

[Chorus: Sia &
Sean Paul
]
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

You're worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control

You're worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outa control
