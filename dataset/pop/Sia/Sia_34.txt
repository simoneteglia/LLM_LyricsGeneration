[Verse 1]
Nights are getting shorter now, hot chocolate
Fills the air and Christmas cheer does too
Pickin' out your Christmas tree, so lovely
The joy this time it brings to you
[Refrain]
(Oh, do-do-do, oh, do-do-do)
(Oh, do-do-do, oh, do-do-do)
(Oh, do-do-do, oh, do-do-do)
Santa's coming to town
(Oh, da-da-da, oh, da-da-da)
(Oh, da-da-da, oh, da-da-da)
(Oh, da-da-da, oh, da-da-da)
Santa's coming to town
[Pre-Chorus]
Sing it to the deer in the sky
Sing it as they jingle, jingle, jingle tonight
Sing it to the moon, set it free
You're the angel on the top of my tree
Sing it to the spirit above
Sing your heart out with all of your love
Santa's coming for us
[Chorus]
Santa's coming for us, Santa's coming for us
Santa's coming for us, Santa's coming for us
Santa's coming for us
Oh, Santa's coming for us
[Verse 2]
Send your letters off to Santa, baby
Tell him all your secret wishes too
Send your letters off to Santa, baby
Hopin' all your wildest dreams come true
[Refrain]
(Oh, do-do-do, oh, do-do-do)
(Oh, do-do-do, oh, do-do-do)
(Oh, do-do-do, oh, do-do-do)
Santa's coming to town
(Oh, da-da-da, oh, da-da-da)
(Oh, da-da-da, oh, da-da-da)
(Oh, da-da-da, oh, da-da-da)
Santa's coming to town
[Pre-Chorus]
Sing it to the deer in the sky
Sing it as they jingle, jingle, jingle tonight
Sing it to the moon, set it free
You're the angel on the top of my tree
Sing it to the spirit above
Sing your heart out with all of your love
Santa's coming for us
[Chorus]
Santa's coming for us, Santa's coming for us
Santa's coming for us, Santa's coming for us
Santa's coming for us
Oh, Santa's coming for us
[Refrain]
(Oh, do-do-do, oh, do-do-do)
