[Verse 1: Sia]
The doctor just gave me the bad news
I've been living like a queen in a castle
Oh, dark spirits runnin' through me like a drive-thru
You'll be my music everybody getting high to
[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth & Sia]
Yeah, I know it
Yeah, I know it, now
Time is running
Time is running out
[Chorus: Labrinth &
Sia
]
I gotta live
Oh, oh-oh
I gotta love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Said, I gotta breathe
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No, this ain't it for me
No-no-no-no-no-no
[Post-Chorus]
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby
No, not today
[Verse 2: Labrinth]
Tick tock and I'm praying for time
You're my angel, put my heart on rewind
So, babe could you do me a favour? (A favour)
Girl, would you be my saviour?
Tick tock and I'm praying for time
[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth]
Yeah, I know it
Yeah, I know it, now
Time is running
Time is running out
[Chorus: Sia]
See, I gotta live
Oh, oh-oh
I gotta love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Said, I gotta breathe
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No, this ain't it for me
No-no-no-no-no-no
[Post-Chorus: Sia & Labrinth]
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
[Bridge: Labrinth]
No, this ain't it for me, no (
Yeah
)
[Outro: Sia]
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait, oh
No, not today, baby, heaven can wait
No, not today, baby
No, not today, babe
