[Intro]
Ooh, together
We can take it higher
[Verse 1]
I can hear the thunder coming from your mouth
And I know my number's up
Give me some Stevie Wonder
Quick, put it on before we go under
I can see the lightning coming from your ears
Yeah, I see you're frightened
I can see the lion sleeps tonight
In the tears you're crying
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too
[Chorus]
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the skies, my love
Together, we can take it higher
(
Ooh, together
) We can take it higher
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the skies, my love
Together, we can take it higher
(
Ooh, together
) We can take it higher
[Verse 2]
I can see the rainbow coming from your heart
Say, "Itâ€™s all okay," so
Come now, see you're my angel
Say, "Bye" to the past, "Hello" to tomorrow
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too
[Chorus]
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the skies, my love
Together, we can take it higher
(
Ooh, together
) We can take it higher
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the skies, my love
Together, we can take it higher
(
Ooh, together
) We can take it higher
[Bridge]
I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it
I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it
I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it
I want love, I wanna give it
I want love, please deliver it
[Chorus]
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the skies, my love
Together, we can take it higher
(
Ooh, together
) We can take it higher
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the skies, my love
Together, we can take it higher
(
Ooh, together
) We can take it higher
[Outro]
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
Ooh, together, we can take it higher
