[Intro]
Feelin' good on a Wednesday, uh
The image of me that you see
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured
Isolated â€” miles out to sea
I don't want a separate place, I need to feel safe
Not thrown away, away, away
[Chorus]
And I will push (Push!)
To tear down the walls (Push! Push!)
Of this box you put me in (Push! Push!)
'Cause you don't understand (Push, ow, hot! Push, ow, ow, hot!)
And now you push
To find a label that fits me
I'm feelin' good on a Wednesday
With my sparklin' thoughts
[Interlude]
Help me unload the car
Ya! Ya! Ya!
[Refrain]
And so I push
To close the door
Of the stall you've made for me
To keep me away!
And now we push (Push!)
To stand together
Because I am Lorde!
Ya! Ya! Ya!
Ya! Ya! Ya!
I am Lorde!
I am Lorde!
Ya! Ya! Ya!
Ya! Ya! Ya!
I am Lorde!
Ya! Ya! Ya!
Ya! Ya! Ya!
I am Lorde!
Ya! Ya! Ya!
