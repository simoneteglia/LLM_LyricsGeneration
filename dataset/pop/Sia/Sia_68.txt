[Verse 1]
Don't let love get in the way
Feel the fear and do it anyway
Take the chance, no it wasn't what you know
Take her hand and don't let go
[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, and you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe, yes, you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe
[Verse 2]
Tell her all of how you feel
Give her everything she needs to hear
Give your heart, and say "come take it"
And she will see that you're a good man
[Chorus]
Oh, yeah, and you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe, yes, you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe
[Outro]
Yes, you can do it, don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it, you're safe
