[Verse 1]
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreamin', oh, on such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
Oh, California dreamin', on such a winter's day
[Verse 2]
I stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees
And I pretended to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin', oh, oh, on such a winter's day
[Breakdown]
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
[Outro]
All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (and the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk, oh, on a winter's day
If I didn't go, I could leave today
California dreamin', on such a winter's day
Oh, on such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
