[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I'm a genius, under pressure, no question, I'm really special
Upper echelon when I bless you, molest you with intellectual
It's a pleasure, it gets sexual, women lemon complexion
Quick connections, then ejections, my love is so ambidextrous
I'm a genius and perfectionist, specialist in the excesses
With excellence for evidence, necklaces for irrelevance
In the room, I'm the elephant, spellin' it for the hell of it
A-B-C-D-R-U-G, H-I-J-K-L-S-D
[Pre-Chorus: Sia,
Labrinth
&
Lil Wayne

O-only a genius could love a woman like she
Oh my God
Baby, baby, don't you see-ee-ee? (
Yeah, yeah

O-o-only a genius could love a woman like she

[Verse 2: Sia]
Oh
You'll be my Einstein, my Newton
My Galileo, and my Hawkings
Boy, put that pep in my step
Put your arm 'round my neck while I am walkin'
Please understand
Yeah, I have fallen for you, you

What, what you say?

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth &
Sia

Oh my God
