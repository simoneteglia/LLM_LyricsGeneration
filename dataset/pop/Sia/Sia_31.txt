[Verse 1]
World, I want to leave you better
I want my life to matter
I am afraid I have no purpose here
I watch the news on TV
Abandon myself daily
I am afraid to let you see the real me
[Pre-Chorus]
Rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Pouring on me
And the rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
We don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds
[Chorus]
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
You’re not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
[Verse 2]
World, you're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together we can do anything
I want to leave you better
I want my life to matter
I am afraid I have no purpose here
[Pre-Chorus]
The rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Pouring on me
And the rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Sowing the seeds of love and hope, love and hope
You don't have to stay, stuck in the weeds
[Chorus]
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
You're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change?
Have I the courage to change today? (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
You’re not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
[Outro]
You're not alone in all this
You're not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
You're not alone in all this
You’re not alone, I promise
Standing together, we can do anything
