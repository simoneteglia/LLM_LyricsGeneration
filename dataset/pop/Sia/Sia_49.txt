[Verse 1]
Take me down
I'm feeling now
And if I move on
I admit you're gone
[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't ready but I'll hold steady
I'll hold you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms
[Chorus]
You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle
[Verse 2]
Step and repeat
Tears fall to the beat
Smile through the pain
Feel the acid rain
[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't ready but I'll hold steady
I'll hold you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms
[Chorus]
And you're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle
[Bridge]
My bags' heavy, been filled by me
They weigh me down, carry them 'round
It's all mine, all mine
I am blinded by the eye of the needle
[Chorus]
You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle, eye of the needle
You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle
