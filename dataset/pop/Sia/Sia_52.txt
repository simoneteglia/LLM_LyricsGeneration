[Verse 1: Jimin, V]
I can't understand what people are sayin'
Who and what do I need to follow
With each step then again grows the shadow
Where is this place I open my eyes to
Maybe Seoul or New York or Paris
I get up, unsteady on my feet
[Verse 2:
RM
]
(Look) Look at my feet, look down
The shadow resembles me
Is it the shadow that's shaking
Or is it my feet that are trembling?
Of course I'm not unafraid
Of course it's not all okay
But I know, awkwardly I flow
I fly together with that black wind
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook, Jin]
(Hey, na-na-na)
Gotta go insane to stay sane
(Hey, na-na-na)
Throw myself whole into both worlds
(Hey, na-na-na)
Can't hold me down 'cause you know I'm a fighter
Carried myself into this beautiful prison
Find me and I'm gonna live with ya
[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jimin, Sia]
(Eh-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
(Eh-oh) I'ma fight, bring the pain on, yeah
Rain be pourin', sky keep fallin'
Everyday, oh, na-na-na
(Eh-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
[Verse 3: j-hope]
Bring the pain, it'll become my blood and flesh
Bring the pain, no fear, now that I know the way (Yeah)
Breathe on the small things (Uh-huh)
My air and my light in the dark (Uh-huh)
The power of the things that make me, me
Even if I fall, I come right up, scream (Yeah)
[Verse 4: SUGA]
Even if I fall, I come right up, scream
That's how we've always been
Even if my knees drop to the ground
As long as they don't get buried
It won't matter
Win no matter what
Win no matter what, win no matter what
Whatever you say, whatever they say, I don't give a uh
I don't give a uh, I don't give a uh, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V]
(Hey, na-na-na)
Gotta go insane to stay sane
(Hey, na-na-na)
Throw myself whole into both worlds
(Hey, na-na-na)
Can't hold me down 'cause you know I'm a fighter
Carried myself into this beautiful prison
Find me and I'm gonna live with ya
[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jimin, V, Jin]
(Eh-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
(Eh-oh) I'ma fight, bring the pain on, yeah
Rain be pourin', sky keep fallin'
Everyday, oh, na-na-na
(Eh-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
[Bridge: Jung Kook, Jimin, Jimin & Jung Kook]
Where my pain lies
Let me take a breath
My everything, my blood and tears
Got no fears, I'm singin', oh-oh-woah-oh-oh
Oh, I'm takin' over
You should know, yeah
Can't hold me down 'cause you know I'm a fighter
Choosing to descend into the dark abyss
Find me and I'm gonna bleed with ya
[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jimin, Jung Kook & Sia, V, Jimin]
(Ayy-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
(Ayy-oh) I'ma fight, bring the pain on, yeah
Rain be pourin', sky keep fallin'
Everyday, oh, na-na-na
(Ayy-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
(Ayy-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
(Ayy-oh) I'ma fight, bring the pain on, yeah
All that I know is just goin' on, and on, and on, and on
(Ayy-oh) I'm alright, bring the pain on, yeah
