[Verse 1]
I'm fighting a battle
I'm fighting my shadow
Herd fears like they're cattle
I'm fighting a battle, yeah
I'm fighting my ego
Lost youth, where did we go wrong?
I'm fighting for me, though
I'm lighting the long way home
[Chorus]
Oh, the past, it haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past, it haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here
[Verse 2]
I'm winning the war now
I'm winning it all now
Watch tears while they fall down
I'm winning the war now
I win against ego
Cast light on the shadow's long
I'm winning for me, though
I'm lighting the long way home
[Chorus]
Oh, the past, it haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past, it haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here
(Haunted me)
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past, it's haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past, it's haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here
[Bridge]
I'm fighting my ego
Lost youth, where did we go wrong?
I'm winning for me, though
I'm lighting the long way home
[Chorus]
Oh, the past, it haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past, it haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here
(Haunted me)
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past, it's haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past, it's haunted me
Oh, the past, it wanted me dead
Oh, the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here
