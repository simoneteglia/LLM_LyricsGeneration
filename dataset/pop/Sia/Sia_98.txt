[Verse 1]
And you say that I'm the devil you know
And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, "You're crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you"
But I wanna be in your arms
They say, "No, don't pick up the phone, let them think there's nobody home"
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call my heart starts to roll
I'll always want more
It's my heaven, my hell
[Pre-Chorus]
We're heading deep inside lives a voice a voice so quiet
But I can't hear the voice when your heart beats next to mine
[Chorus]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it
