[Verse 1]
We had love so strong, my heart couldn't take it
You took it in your hands and resuscitated
You said, "Me and you against the world."
You said, "You and me forever, girl."
I felt every cell fall in love with you, but
[Pre-Chorus]
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came,
but I know her name
, so see you later
[Chorus]
No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No, I won't stand for it, no, I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[Verse 2]
You hurt my pride, part of me died, but all of that's ego
And the house we lived in had no doors, and it had no windows
You said, "I'm hangin' with the boys."
You said, "Workin' late to pay our bills."
But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color
[Pre-Chorus]
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your Playstation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later
[Chorus]
No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No, I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No, I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
[Outro]
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
