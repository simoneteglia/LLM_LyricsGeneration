[Verse 1]
Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And, the worst part is there's no-one else to blame
[Chorus]
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small
And needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
[Verse 2]
Ouch, I have lost myself
Again
Lost myself, and I
Am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I
Might break
Lost myself again
And I feel unsafe
[Chorus]
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small
And needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small
And needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
