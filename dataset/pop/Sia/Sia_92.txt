[Verse 1]
Now I don't wanna float to light
On a cloud of man-made ice
Don't want it to pass me by
Don't want it to pass me by
Saddle up now for the ride
Waiting for the moon to rise
Don't want life to pass me by
Don't want life to pass me by
[Pre-Chorus]
But I've been waiting for a magic moment
But maybe there are magic moments
Could it be a magic moment now?
I've been waiting for a magic moment
But maybe there are magic moments
Baby it's a magic moment now
[Chorus]
But darling it's a magical, magical life, life, life
Oh, honey, it's a magical, magical life, life, life
And baby it's a magical, magical life, life, life
When you can find the magic in an everyday night, night, night
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an ordinary life
Magic in an ordinary life
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an ordinary life
Magic in an ordinary life
[Verse 2]
I could see the rain come down
But I know the seeds be found
I'm gon' watch 'em grow up now
I'm gon' watch 'em grow up now
In the flower's face I see
In the flower's face is me
I'm gon' watch me grow up now
I'm gon' watch me grow up now
[Pre-Chorus]
But I've been waiting for a magic moment
But maybe there are magic moments
Could it be a magic moment now?
I've been waiting for a magic moment
But maybe there are magic moments
Baby it's a magic moment now
[Chorus]
But darling it's a magical, magical life, life, life
Oh, honey, it's a magical, magical life, life, life
And baby it's a magical, magical life, life, life
When you can find the magic in an everyday night, night, night
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an ordinary life
Magic in an ordinary life
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an everyday night
Magic in an ordinary life
Magic in an ordinary life
