[Verse]
Have you told me all?
I've got things to say
Hey, I'm talking to ya
We got things to do
We got plans to make
And I wanna take you with me
Yeah, I wanna take you with me
[Pre-Chorus]
But a far-off gaze is wide in me
Can you feel it?
And if you can't tell I'm a restless girl
What are you hearing?
[Chorus]
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need, I'm flying
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need to be free
Pack it all away, pack it all in one suitcase
I got all I need, all I need, I'm flying
