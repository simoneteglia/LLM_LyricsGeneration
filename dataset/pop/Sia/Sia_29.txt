[Verse 1]
It's dangerous to fall in love, but I wanna burn with you tonight
Hurt me
There's two of us, we're certain with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire burn me
[Pre-Chorus]
So come on, I'll take you on, take you on
I ache for love, ache for us
Why don't you come, don't you come a little closer?
So come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect, somehow
We were meant for one another, come a little closer
[Chorus]
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came after me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight
[Verse 2]
And we will fly like smoke darkenin' the skies
I'm Eve, I wanna try, take a bite
[Pre-Chorus]
So come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect, somehow
We were meant for one another, come a little closer
[Chorus]
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came back to me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight
[Bridge]
But it's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I got to get it
When the fire dies, darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left
But it's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I got to get it
When the fire dies, darkened the skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left
[Chorus]
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came back to me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight
[Outro]
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight, ay, eh
