[Verse]
Talk to me, baby
Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up?
Girl, I saw it in your eyes
And, baby, I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight
You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone
Would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this
But I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected
Girl, you're such a masochist
And I ask why
And you reply
I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So, baby, don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone
Baby, please
Would you end your night with me?
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little lie
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh, ooh
