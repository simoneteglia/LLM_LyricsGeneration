[Intro: The Weeknd &
Ariana Grande
]
Ooh (
Ooh
)
Na-na, yeah
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
[Refrain: The Weeknd &
Ariana Grande
]
I don't know why I run away (
Oh
)
I make you cry when I run away (
Oh
)
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
[Chorus: The Weeknd &
Ariana Grande
]
Save your tears for another day (
Oh
)
Save your tears for another day (
Mm
)
[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell
[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better
[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

&
