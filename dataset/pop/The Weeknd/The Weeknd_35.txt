[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Devil on my shoulder tellin' me I'll die soon
I don't really want that to impact you
But I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid
I just want the best for you, I just want what's left of you
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
Oh, you tell me that you're sad inside
I'm sad that I can't satisfy
Yeah, I pray that I get it right this time
Maybe we'll be alright
[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile
I want you to prosper and come proper
Even if that means I ain't by your side
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Oh yeah
I just wanna see you smile (You smile)
Don't cry (Don't cry, yeah)
Even though it means I gotta let you go (Yeah)
Dependent on ya, gotta learn to be alone ('Lone)
'Cause I'm so desensitized
When our skin is touching (Yeah), I need drugs to love you (Yeah)
You want so much more from me, but I can only fuck you (You)
I spent every day right beside you ('Side you), 'side you ('Side you)
A hundred pics of me on your phone
Now you're someone that I used to know
At this point, we playin' with fire (Fire), fire (Fire)
You don't wanna see what's in my phone
It's just gonna hurt you more (More)
[Chorus: Juice WRLD &
The Weeknd
