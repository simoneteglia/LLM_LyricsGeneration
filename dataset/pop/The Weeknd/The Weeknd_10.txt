[Intro: The Weeknd]
Yeah, ah
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
You are not the single type
So, baby, this the perfect time
I'm just tryna get you high (I'm just tryin', babe)
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So, baby, I can make it right
You just gotta let me try (Try)
To give you what you want
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
[Chorus: The Weeknd &
Daft Punk
]
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Uh, you've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
[Chorus: The Weeknd & Daft Punk]
I feel it comin' (
I feel it comin'
)
I feel it comin', babe (
I feel it comin', babe
)
I feel it comin' (
I feel it comin'
)
I feel it comin', babe (I know what you feel right now)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I feel it comin', baby)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I know what you say right now, babe)
I feel it comin' (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na;
I feel it comin'
)
I feel it comin', babe (
I feel it comin', babe
; oh, babe)
I feel it comin' (
I feel it comin'
)
I feel it comin', babe (I know what you say right now)
I feel it comin' (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na; I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I feel it comin', baby)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe
[Outro: Daft Punk]
I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', babe
