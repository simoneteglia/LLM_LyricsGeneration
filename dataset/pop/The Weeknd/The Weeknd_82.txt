[Verse 1]
Where were you when I needed you eight months ago?
All your girlfriends talkin' 'bout me, now you ringing up my phone
I bet you miss me now, baby, I bet you'd kiss me now, baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun
[Pre-Chorus]
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential couldn't ever last this long
Well, baby, I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right?
[Chorus]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song
[Verse 2]
And now I'm poppin', yeah
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin', yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you, girl, ooh
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well, you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club
[Pre-Chorus]
You never thought that I would ever go this far (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, never thought I'd go this far, oh yeah)
You said potential couldn't ever last this long (Never thought it could last this long)
Well, baby, I've been alone for almost all my life (I've been alone for a lot)
What makes you think that you can ever do me right? (Ooh, yeah)
[Chorus]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song
