[Verse 1]
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful
And stay forever young
This I know, uh
This I know
[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry
No more"
We both know we can't go
Without it
She told me, "You'll never
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh"
[Chorus]
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
[Verse 2]
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary
When we're deep in love
This I know, this I know (Girl)
Girl, I know, uh
[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry
No more"
We both know we can't go
Without it
She told me, "You'll never
Be alo-oh-oh-ooh"
[Chorus]
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it
But I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with
You (I can't feel my face)
But I love it (But I love it)
But I love it (I can't feel my face) oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (When I'm with you)
But I love it (But I love it, yeah)
But I love it (But I love it,) oh

She told me, "Don't worry
About it"
She told me, "Don't worry

Without it
