[Verse: Lana Del Rey]
I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratchin' counter tops, I was screamin'
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hittin'
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it (I love it), starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, starboy
[Outro: The Weeknd]
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
I just wanna see you shine 'cause I know you are a stargirl
