[Verse]
Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone (Together we're alone)
In Vegas, I feel so at home (In Vegas, I feel so at home)
I'm falling only for the night
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky (The sky)
Oh, oh, oh, how much to light up my star again
And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh, baby, won't you remind me what I am
And break, break my little cold heart?
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
[Chorus]
Call me up and I'll send for you
Take me down to your altitude
I don't know if I can be alone again (Alone again)
I don't know if I can sleep alone again (Alone again)
Check my pulse for a second time (A second time)
I took too much, I don't wanna die
I don't know if I can be alone again (Alone again)
I don't know if I can sleep alone again
[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
[Outro]
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
'Cause I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can be alone again
