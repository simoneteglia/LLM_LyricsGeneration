[Intro: The Weeknd]
Ooh ahh
Ooh ahh, ahh
Ohh yeah, yeah
Ooh ahh, ahh
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Why you rushing me, baby?
It's only us, alone
I don't want to die tonight, baby
So lemme sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right
I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right (Oh yeah)
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'ma touch you right (Ooh yeah)
(Just let me sip this slow)
I'ma touch you right
(Let me get inside my zone)
I'ma touch you right (Oh yeah)
(Just let me)
Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh yeah
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
And I'ma lean, 'til I fall, ooh yeah
And I don't give a damn
I felt the ground before
I left it all behind, baby
I didn't need no one
But I'm in need tonight baby
I've been alone for too long
Ohh, oh yeah
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
So, I won't say a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right (Ooh, yeah)
Oh, I can't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right (Ooh)
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'ma touch you right (Ohh yeah)
(Just let me sip this slow)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right
(Let me get inside my zone)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right
(Just let me)
Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh, yeah
[Interlude]
[Verse 3: Drake]
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah
