[Verse 1]
I love her, today
‘Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late
Ooh, now I need to know
If you're feeling when I'm free
[Chorus]
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, make sure
You are thirsty, oh, on Thursday, baby
Get ready, oh, on Thursday
Why you calling? Oh, on Thursday
Just wait on Thursday, baby
Only Thursday
[Verse 2]
Woah
Girl I try, girl I try
I've been here for too long
Baby, don't cry
Why are you calling again? (Oh, again)
But it's not Thursday, baby why you calling?
[Chorus]
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday But on Thursday, make sure
You are thirsty, oh, on Thursday, baby
Get ready, oh, on Thursday
Why you holding in, oh, on Thursday
Just wait on Thursday, baby
Only Thursday
