[Part I: The Party]
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I understand, your body wants it
I know your thoughts, oh you 'bout it, 'bout it
You're a big girl, and it's your world
And I'ma let you do it how you (Wanna, girl, I'll)
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ride with it, ride with it
I know you know, I know you wanna ride with it
Don't be shy with it, I'll supply with it
I got you, girl, oh, I got it, girl
With your Louis V. bag, tats on your arms
High heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink, baby, don't you fall
Be there in a minute, baby, just one call
You don't gotta ask me
[Chorus: Victoria Legrand &
The Weeknd
]
You always come to the parties (
Oh, oh
)
To pluck the feathers off all the birds (
Oh
)
You always come to the parties
Ride, ride
On your knees
I will not beg you, please
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Girl, pick up them shoes, I'll race your ass up all them stairs
Just grab a room, I swear no one will  (interfere)
Girl, bring your friends, if you want, we can share
Or we can keep it simple, baby we can just
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ride with it, ride with it
I know you know, I know you wanna *sniff* with it
Don't be shy with it, I'll supply with it
I got you, girl, oh, I got it, girl
With your Louis V. bag, tats on ya arms
High heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
I got what you need
Girl, I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink, baby, don't you fall
Be there in a minute, baby, just one call
You don't gotta ask me
[Chorus: Victoria Legrand &
The Weeknd
]
You always come to the parties (
Oh

To pluck the feathers off all the birds
You always come to the parties
On your knees
I will not beg you, please
I will not, I will not, I will not
I will not, I will not
I will not, I will not
[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Ride with it, ride with it

Don't be shy with it

[Part II: The After Party]
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I think I'm fucking gone, rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Should have fucking rolled, but I fucking pulled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your loving
I need more
I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sitting on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sipping on this, baby, living off bliss
Got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drowning from my wrist
Baby, if you knew
The feeling I would give to
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You
Oh, you
You
Oh, you
Cause I got it, girl
Oh, I got it, girl
With me
With me
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Oh, I got it, girl
With me, with me
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I, I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blowjob
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stopping
So, momma please stop calling
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove
This feeling I would give to
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You
Oh, you
You
Oh, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Well, I got it, girl
With me, with me
With me
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Whoa, you
Oh, I got it, girl
Yeah, I got it, girl
With me, with me
[Outro: The Weeknd]
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, I got it, girl
