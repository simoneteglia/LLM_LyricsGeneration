[Verse 1]
Tell me the truth, baby girl, who else been with you?
It's gon' come to my attention either way, yeah (Uh, yeah)
And I understand, baby girl, we all have a past
I'd much rather hear the truth come straight from you (Yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you (If I love you)
It'd be just for you (It'd be just for you)
So when I'm touchin' you (Touchin' you)
Can I trust in you? (Trust in you)
Can I trust in you? Oh, babe (Trust in you)
[Chorus]
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover (Hey, hey)
True colors, true colors (Woo)
[Verse 2]
What's done is done now that I'm the only one
If you tell me, I'll accept what you've been through, oh yeah
And I don't believe all this inconsistency
I've been hearin' different stories about you
[Pre-Chorus]
So if I love you (If I love you)
It'd be just for you (It'd be just for you)

Baby, show me you're a keeper (Hey, oh)
It's been hard for me to keep up (Oh)
You've been tryna keep me in the dark (Oh)
But, baby girl, I see you (Oh)
Baby, show me you're a keeper (Show me you're a keeper)
It's been hard for me to keep up (Hard for me to keep up)
You've been tryna keep me in the dark (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
