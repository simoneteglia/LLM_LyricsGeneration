[Verse 1]
I realized I belong to you
I feel the darkness when away from you, hey yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
[Chorus]
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
)
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
) Yeah
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
)
[Verse 2]
Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it? Woah-woah
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no, I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
[Chorus]
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
) Oh
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
)
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
(
Nothin', nothin', nothin'
)
[Outro]
When I feel the love, girl, I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch, touch, touch
I'll be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' without you
