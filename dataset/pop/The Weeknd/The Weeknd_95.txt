[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
[Chorus]
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
[Verse 2]
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time
[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember when I held you (Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you (Hey)
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind (Uh)
[Chorus]
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (No)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (Hey)
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
[Outro: The Weeknd &
Tomoko Aran
]
Ooh, singin', out of time
Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Uh)
Out of time (
Pretend—
)
Out of time (
Pretend—
)
[Spoken Outro: Jim Carrey]
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks
