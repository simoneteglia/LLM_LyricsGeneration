[Intro: The Weeknd]
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I got something to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
Girl, I been bad again, girl, I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use 'em
When I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down (Ayy)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Oh no)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Ayy)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Ayy)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Ooh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Oh yeah)
I always want you when I'm coming down
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Poppin' again, I tried to quit again
I'm always tight with something I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end
Supply what I take, I take what I spend, baby
I ain't lying to nobody but me
And you, and me
But you especially
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Pick up your phone (Oh, oh)
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I always want you when I'm coming down (No, oh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (When I'm coming down)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Right down, right down, right down)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Ah)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Ah)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Ah-oh)
I always want you when I'm coming down (Right down)
I always want you when I'm coming down

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
