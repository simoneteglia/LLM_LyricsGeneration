[Verse 1]
Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want 'em too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes
[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
[Verse 2]
You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all
Behind, behind
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lies, your lies
Every time you close your eyes
[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
[Bridge]
Wipe the lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes (Wipe the)
You can't hide it (Lust from your eyes)
You can't be the one, I rely (I see)
We're divided (That you're not mine)
[Chorus]
I hear the secrets that you keep (Secrets that you keep)
When you're talkin' in your sleep (Talkin' in your sleep)
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep (Secrets that you keep)
When you're talk, talkin', talkin' (Oh, baby)
I hear the secrets that you keep (Secrets that you keep)
When you're talkin' in your sleep (Talkin' in your sleep)
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep (Secrets that you keep)
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
