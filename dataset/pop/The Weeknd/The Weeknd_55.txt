[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah, ey
[Verse 1]
I know what you did
I know
So I'ma let you taste her
I ain't washing my sins
I ain't washing my sins
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did
You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But, baby, it's okay
I swear it's okay
[Chorus]
'Cause I know everything, yeah
I know everything, yeah-yeah
I know everything (Everything), ayy, ayy
I know everything, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
Tryin' to keep me up
And you are dry
But, baby, it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier, oh, oh, oh, ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding all it behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did, ooh, hey
You probably thought that you'd break my heart (Ooh, ooh)
You probably thought that you'd make me cry (Woo)
But, baby, it's okay
It's okay, ayy
[Chorus]
I know everything
I know everything, yeah
Everything, yeah
I know everything
