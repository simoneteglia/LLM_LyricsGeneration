[Verse 1]
All she cares about is money
And the city where she's from
Her intention is the paper
She don't need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well, babygirl, I'm zoning
Somebody should've told her
[Chorus]
I popped one
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh girl, I'm on one
Fuck it, I popped one
I popped one
[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm lying, I'm on a few
Don't you worry, this ain't new
Can we take this to your spot?
I'm on eviction number 2
'Cause I popped one, oh
Fuck it, I popped one
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Trust issues
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh woah
[Verse 3]
Do you know what's going on over here?
(I do, I do, I do)
Have you even bothered to look?
(I did, oh, I did)
Well, if you know, then let me know
We don't gotta be running in these circles
In these circles, no more
[Chorus]
Trust issues
Trust issues
Trust issues
Trust issues
Trust issues
Oh yeah (Trust issues)
Trust issues, no more (Trust issues)
Trust issues, no more (Trust issues)
Trust issues, no more (Trust issues)
Oh yeah (Trust issues)
Oh (Trust issues)
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Ooh woah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
