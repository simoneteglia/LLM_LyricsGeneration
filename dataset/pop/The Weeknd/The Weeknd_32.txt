[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Ask around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase (No, no)
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money, she play no games
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy (Candy)
She wanna make 'em leave they family (Family)
She tryna live a life so fancy (Fancy)
She wanna pull up in a Bentley (Bentley)
She ain't got time for lovin' (Lovin')
Louis Vuitton her husband (Husband)
She'd rather die in lustin' (Lustin')
She'd rather die in the club till she
[Chorus: The Weeknd &
Future
]
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under
(That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, six, six feet under
(That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, go'n and turn that ass around
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Countin' all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no backbone
Got a couple niggas blingin' up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waitin' back home, she got it
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She lick it up just like a candy (Candy)
She wanna make 'em leave they family (Family)
She tryna live a life so fancy (Fancy)
She wanna pull up in a Bentley (Bentley)
She ain't got time for lovin' (Lovin')
Louis Vuitton her husband (Husband)
She'd rather die in lustin' (Lustin')
She'd rather die in the club till she
[Chorus: The Weeknd &
Future
]
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper (That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' get that fuckin' paper
You know how she get down, pop it for a check now
Six feet under, six, six feet under
(That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, six, six feet under
(That fuckin' paper)
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, go'n and turn that ass around
[Post-Chorus: Future &
The Weeknd
]
Go'n and turn that ass around (
Yeah, yeah
)
Oh, murder, oh, murder
Go'n and turn that ass around
Oh murder, oh murder
[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Real love's hard to find (Real love's hard to find)
So she don't waste her time (So she don't waste her time)
So she don't waste her time, oh
You ain't gon' catch her cryin' (You ain't gon' catch her cryin')
She ain't gon' lose her mind (Mind)
She ain't gon' lose her mind till she
[Outro: Future &
The Weeknd
]
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper (
Till she
)
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper (
Till she
)
Six feet under, she gon' kill me for the paper
Not the type to fuck around, go'n and turn that ass around
