[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Only losers go to school
I taught myself how to move
I'm not the type to count on you, uh
'Cause stupid's next to "I love you"
No?
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
So what can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
We make our own sense
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
We make our own sense
[Post-Chorus: The Weeknd,
Labrinth
]
And you're qualified to
And you're qualified to
And you're qualified to
[Verse 2: Labrinth]
Only losers go to school
They can't teach what they can't prove
Come put this inside a test tube
'Cause stupid's next to "I love you"
[Chorus: Labrinth]
So what can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
'Cause we make our own sense
You're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
'Cause we make our own sense
And you're qualified to...
[Post-Chorus: The Weeknd,
Labrinth
]
And you're qualified to
And you're qualified to
And you're qualified to
[Bridge: The Weeknd]
And now that we're all grown up
Who do we owe it to?
And now that we've gone this far
Who do we owe it all to?
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
And now that we all came up
Do we lose? Do we lose?
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
So what can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
'Cause we make our own sense
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
'Cause we make our own sense
[Post-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And you're qualified to me
And you're qualified to me
