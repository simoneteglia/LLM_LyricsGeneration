[Verse]
What makes a grown man wanna cry?
(
Cry, cry, cry, cry
)
What makes him wanna take his life? (Ah, ah)
(
Yeah
)
His happiness is never real
(
Real, real, real, real
)
And mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he heals
[Chorus]
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter (It don't matter)
It won't matter (Matter)
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (Time, it's time, babe)
It won't matter (It won't matter, babe)
It won't matter (Ya)
It was like he was never there
(It was like he was never there)
It was like he was gone in thin air, oh
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time (Oh, baby)
It won't matter (It won't matter, baby)
It won't matter
[Post-Chorus]
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter
It won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter
It won't matter
It was like he was never there
It was like he was gone in thin air
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
[Interlude]
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time
It won't matter, it won't matter
[Bridge]
Ooh, now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul (In my soul)
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it
[Outro]
And it's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Woah, woah
Don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Oh, ooh, oh
Hey!
