[Verse 1]
When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go (Yeah, yeah)
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close (Yeah)
Should have known you were lonely
[Pre-Chorus]
I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
[Chorus]
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
[Verse 2]
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else (Uh, uh)
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left (Uh)
They just made you feel lonely (Hey)
[Pre-Chorus]
I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart
[Chorus]
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again (Hey)
[Post-Chorus]
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start
[Bridge]
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
[Chorus]
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
I said don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start
