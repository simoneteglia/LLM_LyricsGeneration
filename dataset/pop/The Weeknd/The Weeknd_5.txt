[Verse 1]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)
[Chorus]
You know me (Know me, uh,
na-na-na-na-na
)
You know me (Know me, know me,
oh-oh-oh
)
You know me (Know me, know me,
na-na-na-na-na
)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)
[Verse 2]
Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape,
sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies
,
roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you
[Chorus]
'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, ah,
na-na-na-na-na
)
You know me (Know me, know me,
oh-oh-oh
)
You know me (Know me, know me,
na-na-na-na-na
)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)
[Bridge]
Why don't you shake somethin', shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin', work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Baby girl, won't you shake somethin', shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin' (Work), work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
[Refrain]
'Cause you know me
Girl, you know me
You already know me
Yeah, you know me
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na
