[Intro]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby
[Verse 1]
You're saying that you miss me, oh well
I never even got a kiss without a countdown
It's time to face the facts, you treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure, you're never really sure
Boy, you never listen
[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe
[Verse 2]
You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up
Time to come to terms, put myself first
When your bubble bursts got soap in your eye
I'm telling you it's wrong to break into my songs
Boy, you gotta listen
[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, babe
[Bridge]
So take this as my last goodbye and play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby
[Outro]
So take this as my last goodbye and play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try to reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line, press record then hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh
To erase you, ooh-ooh
