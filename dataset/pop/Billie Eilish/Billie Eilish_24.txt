[Verse 1]
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
[Verse 2]
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
[Chorus]
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
[Post-Chorus]
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
[Verse 3]
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?
[Chorus]
'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
[Outro]
Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for
