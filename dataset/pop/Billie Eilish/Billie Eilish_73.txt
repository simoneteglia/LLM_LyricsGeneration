Tell me if you still miss me
Tell me if you still won't forgive me
What will you do with all this poison? Nothing good
Tell me if you still miss me
[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Billie Eilish]
Are you going to forget it? Can you let it go?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
Are you going to forget it? Can you let it go?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
[Interlude: ROSALÍA]
Isn't good
And that's it
Ah, kisses, haha, take care, please
[Verse 2: Billie Eilish &
ROSALÍA
]
Tell me that you still don't regret it
Tell me if we still have something in common
Wе don't get back the time wе've lost
Give me a kiss and lower me from the cross
[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Billie Eilish]
Are you going to forget it? Can you let it go?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
Are you going to forget it? Can you let it go?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
Can you let it go? Are you going to forget it?
[Bridge: ROSALÍA]
Ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ah-ah
[Outro: ROSALÍA &

Love can't be measured steadily
One day I'm a Goddess and the next day I can break
I needed to go 'cause I needed to know you don't need me
You reap what you sow, but it seems like you don't even see me
Love can't be measured steadily
One day I'm a Goddess and the next day I can break
You say it to me like it's something I have any choice in
If I wasn't important, then why would you waste all your poison?
