[Intro]
Okay
Mm-mm, I
[Verse 1]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a "You mad at me?" text
Shoulda guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed
[Chorus]
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
[Verse 2]
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, eyеs)
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't dеserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so
[Chorus]
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend, too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news
