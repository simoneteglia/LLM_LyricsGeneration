[Verse 1]
I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really (I don't really), how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction
No reaction
[Chorus]
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
[Verse 2]
I don't really wanna know why it went there (Why it went there)
I kinda don't care (Kinda don't care)
You wanna kill me? (You wanna kill me?)
You wanna hurt me? (Mmm)
Stop bein' flirty
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think "This is the right thing to do"?
(Is it news? News to who?)
That I really look just like the rest of you
[Chorus]
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
[Bridge]
And everybody said it was a letdown
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
(Am I?) Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches, it's none of my business
But don't you get sick of posin' for pictures
With that plastic body?
[Chorus]
Man, I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
