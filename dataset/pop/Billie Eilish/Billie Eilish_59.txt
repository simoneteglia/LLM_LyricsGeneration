[Verse 1]
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Sleepwalk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave
[Chorus]
I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
[Verse 3]
Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Made mistakes, made our marks
Now we've gone dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 4]
Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything
[Chorus]
I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true
[Post-Chorus]
And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue
True blue
[Outro]
I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
