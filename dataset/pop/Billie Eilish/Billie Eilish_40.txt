[Verse 1]
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few
[Verse 2]
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you
[Verse 3]
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3 AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 4]
I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was madе for you
For you
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week or two, or two
I think I might havе fallen in love
What am I to do?
