[Chorus]
Drink from the leche of sirens
Summon the sailors in town
Strangle the fear of decidin'
Which ones deservin' to drown
[Verse 1]
Engraved in our memory, the harm that was done
Our mothers, the witches they banished and burned
All of our sisters were killed and abused
By sword-swingin' men who would always accuse
The worst of a woman who fights for our right
To be where we belong at the front of the line
Tired of silence and bein' politе
Your legs turn to shimmerin' scales in thе night
[Chorus]
Drink from the leche of sirens
Summon the sailors in town
Strangle the fear of decidin'
Which ones deservin' to drown
Don't feel bad when these fuckers all drown
[Post-Chorus]
Let them drown
Let them drown
Let them drown
[Verse 2]
Tenderness worn on the skin like a dress
Nurture these men, pull them out of their mess
They steal the resources, destroy all the land
Belittle the power of the feminine hand
The milk from the rivers of every moon
Cradle you tight like you're back in the womb
Bury their souls in a cove by the light
Celestial dip, all that ego and pride
[Chorus]
Drink from the leche of sirens
Summon the sailors in town
Strangle the fear of decidin'
Which ones deservin' to drown
[Post-Chorus]
Let them drown
Let them drown
Let them drown
[Outro]
Nothin' wrong with a little havoc
It's fun when shit hits the fan
So guillotine their heads by shoutin'
"Cut 'em off, leave waters red"
Nothin' wrong with a little havoc
It's fun when shit hits the fan
So guillotine their heads by shoutin'
"Cut 'em off, leave waters red"
Nothin' wrong with a little havoc (Drink from the leche of sirens)
It's fun when shit hits the fan
So guillotine their heads by shoutin' (Summon the sailors in town)
"Cut 'em off, leave waters red"
Nothin' wrong with a little havoc (Strangle the fear of decidin')
It's fun when shit hits the fan
So guillotine their heads by shoutin' (Which ones deservin' to drown)
"Cut 'em off, leave waters red"
(Don't feel bad when these fuckers all drown)
