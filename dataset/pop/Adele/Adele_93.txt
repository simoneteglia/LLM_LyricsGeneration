[Verse 1]
I move like a moth or a butterfly
Craving a change in the wind
I swirl by all the insects and all the flies
Watching the cycle they're in
[Pre-Chorus]
Better off dead than wastin' my hours
Flying where I shouldn't be
Flexing like pricks with their stolen power
They're just who the spider will eat
[Chorus]
Spinning all your silk and moving all of your eight legs
To build a web that'll spread through the world
Feeding off our highs and lows
And curious to see us struggle
No one can leave once they merge
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, no onе can leave once thеy merge
Oh, no one can leave once they merge
[Verse 2]
I'm hiding myself from the enemy
I wish to not be perceived
Didn't ask for this dangerous visibility
I'm feeling too scared to sleep
[Pre-Chorus]
Better off dead than stuck in a maze
The center may seem like a gift
Once you arrive, it'll strip you of your life
And you'll wish that you never did
[Chorus]
Spinning all your silk and moving all of your eight legs
To build a web that'll spread through the world
Feeding off our highs and lows
And curious to see us struggle
No one can leave once they merge
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, no one can leave once they merge
Oh, no one can leave once they merge
[Outro]
Big bite, they liquify the insides first
Then wrap them tight, securing their spot in the spider web
Up all night, bound to their addiction to it
Lifeless eyes, they die in the pit of the spider web
