[Verse 1]
I'm not a bad guy
So don’t treat me bad if I'm feelin' sad, alright?
Please don’t be mad if I don't smile back, alright?
If I fuck up my words, don't think I'm absurd, alright?
Alright?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beatin'
I'm chewin' gum to pass this time of sadness
Can’t you see it?
You’re too busy seekin' selfish wishes
Don’t care how I'm feelin'
You write me up and say it's love
And I can’t believe it
[Chorus]
Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention
[Post-Chorus]
De-de-detention
De-de-detention
Pretending everything's alright is (Shh)
[Verse 2]
The teachers don't care about me
Fuck how I feel as long as I make money
They let them do whatever they want to me
They're the customer, I'm chopped meat
I'm chopped meat
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm physically exhausted
Tired of my knuckles beatin'
I'm chewin' gum to pass this time of sadness
Can't you see it?
You're too busy seekin' selfish wishes
Don't care how I'm feelin'
You write me up and say it's love
And I can't believe it
[Chorus]
Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention
[Post-Chorus]
De-de-detention
De-de-detention
Pretending everything's alright is detention
[Bridge]
I wanna go home and you say, "Now is not the time"
Fuck bein' all alone in the back of the classroom, ah
Stop callin' up my phone tryna say that I've been out of line
When all I ever asked was to go to the bathroom
[Chorus]
Baby, can you meet me tonight in detention?
I can feel your blood pressure rise, fuck this tension
Let me crawl up into your mind, did I mention?
Pretending everything's alright is detention
[Outro]
Tonight, I can feel your blood pressure rise
Let me crawl up into your mind
Pretending everything's alright (Is detention)
