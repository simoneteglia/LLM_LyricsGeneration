[Verse 1]
Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by
The rules of someone else's game
Too late for second guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap
[Chorus]
It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you won't bring me down
[Verse 2]
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But till I try, I'll never know
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love, I guess I've lost
Well if that's love, it comes at
At much too high a cost
[Chorus]
I'd sooner by defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you won't bring me down
[Bridge]
Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision almost like a prophecy
I know it's sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear someday I'll be
Flying so high (I'm defying gravity)
Kiss me goodbye (I'm defying gravity)
So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky
As someone told me lately
Everyone deserves the chance to fly
I'm defying gravity
And you won't bring me down!
Bring me down!
Bring me down!
Ah
