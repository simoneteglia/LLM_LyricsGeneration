[Verse 1]
Caught the teacher giving his eyes to a student
Pouty, pretty cute, and she bit her lip back to him
Chewing on her nails and her pens while she's dreaming of him
And he's fucking in sin (You know he is)
[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "It's for all the right reasons, baby
Don't care 'bout grades, just call me your lady
If I pass this quiz, will you give me your babies?
Don't call me crazy
You love me, but you won't come save me
You got a wife and kids, you see them daily
Don't know why you even made me"
[Chorus]
Teacher's pet
If I'm so special, why am I secret?
Yeah, why the fuck is that?
Do you regret the things we shared that I'll never forget?
Well, do you? Tell me that
I know I'm young, but my mind is well beyond my years
I knew this wouldn't last, but fuck you, don't you leave me here
Teacher's pet
If I'm so special, why am I secret? (Why am I?)
[Verse 2]
She's feeling like a spider in a cage
You liar, you were her desire
Now she wants to light you on fire
But fuck it, she'll still give you a call
And a lighter when you wanna get high
And mess around 'til you get numb
[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "It's for all the right reasons, baby
Don't care 'bout grades, just call me your lady
If I pass this quiz, will you give me your babies?
Don't call me crazy
You love me, but you won't come save me
You got a wife and kids, you see them daily
Don't know why you even made me"
[Chorus]
Teacher's pet
If I'm so special, why am I secret?
Yeah, why the fuck is that?
Do you regret the things we shared that I'll never forget?
Well, do you? Tell me that
I know I'm young, but my mind is well beyond my years
I knew this wouldn't last, but fuck you, don't you leave me here
Teacher's pet
If I'm so special, why am I secret? (Why am I?)
[Bridge]
Gimme back my money
Didn't learn a damn thing, honey, from you
Except how to lie and cheat while inside the sheets
Stop calling me your bunny
I won't hop and you don't own me
Do you? I bet you think you do
Well, you don't
[Chorus]
Teacher's pet
If I'm so special, why am I secret? (Why am I? Why am I?)
Yeah, why the fuck is that?
Do you regret the things we shared that I'll never forget?
Well, do you? Tell me that
I know I'm young, but my mind is well beyond my years
I knew this wouldn't last, but fuck you, don't you leave me here
Teacher's pet
If I'm so special, why am I secret? (Why am I?)
