[Verse 1]
One, two, melatonin is coming for you
Three, four, baby, won't you lock the door?
Five, six, I'm done with this
Seven, eight, it's getting late, so close your eyes, sleep for days
[Pre-Chorus]
Hush, little baby, drink your spoiled milk
I'm fucking crazy, need my prescription filled
Do you like my cookies? They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar, but lots of poison, too
[Chorus]
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh, honey do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
[Verse 2]
Nine, ten, never want to see you again
Eleven, twelve, I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain that I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone, think twice when you grab the phone
[Chorus]
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh, honey do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
[Chorus]
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh, honey do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
