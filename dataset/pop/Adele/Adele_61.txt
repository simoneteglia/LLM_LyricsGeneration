[Intro]
La, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
[Verse 1]
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
With a bow-tied ribbon, stop it
Eating all the rainbow cookies
Pies are flying through the roof
Not my first pick, but I'll do it
Make the cash right so I could move quick
Out the shithole with a new whip
Cream on top,
I'm 'bout to prove it
[Refrain]
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
[Verse 2]
My boss is Mother Mary
Catch me slipping through the concrete
Show no mercy, step right on me
Stiletto death, send me to purgatory
[Chorus]
The bakery, tryna make some more
They expect me to stay when I should go
Grab the bag for when I cross the door
It ain't for me to roll it out, it's just for me to raise the dough
[Verse 3]
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
With a bow-tied ribbon, stop it
Eating all the rainbow cookies
Pies are flying through the roof
Arbitrary, the way they all go
Knock 'em down like she a dodgeball
Little mess-up and she's angry
One downfall, she blame the whole team
[Refrain]
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
Pack it, box it, flip it, top it
(Pack it, box it, flip it, top it)
[Chorus]
The bakery, tryna make some more
They expect me to stay when I should go
Grab the bag for when I cross the door
It ain't for me to roll it out,
it's just for me to raise the dough
The bakery, tryna make some more
They expect me to stay when I should go
Grab the bag for when I cross the door
It ain't for me to roll it out, it's just for me to raise theâ€“
[Outro]
La, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la
La, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la
