[Verse 1]
My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely
[Bridge: Adele &
Angelo Adkins
]
Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent
[Verse 2]
I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save mе
[Bridge: Angelo Adkins &
Adele
]
Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel likе that?
Do you like me?
You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?
[Chorus]
I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)
[Bridge: Adele &
Angelo Adkins
]
Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just, like, hang on, my fingers are trapped
Like, um, I feel a bit confused
Why?
I don't know
And I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make me go...
[Verse 3]
My little love
Tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad
[Bridge: Adele &
Angelo Adkins
]
I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh
[Chorus]
I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)
[Outro]
I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, I feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
And I feel like today, I'm home and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up in a ball and
Be in my sweats and stuff like that, but I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot
