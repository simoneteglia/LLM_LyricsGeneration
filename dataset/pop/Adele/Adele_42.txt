[Verse 1]
I'm just looking out the window and it's cold outside
There are two boys yelling behind me and I'm terrified
Counting trees as they pass me by
And I'm trying not to look across the aisle
'Cause Maya's letting Dan put his hand up her skirt
And she's got her hand down his pants
[Pre-Chorus]
I know the driver sees it
I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror
He says nothing
Trying to ignore it, it's fucking boring
I'm quietly observing‚ I'm saying nothing
[Chorus]
No one's watching us‚ don't give a fuck
Wheels on the bus
I'm holding it down up in the front
Wheels on the bus
Ooh‚ ooh, ooh
Wheels on the bus
[Verse 2]
Now, I'ma light it up and pass it
Puff‚ puff and pass it
Don't be a dick and babysit, c'mon, just pass it over here
Counting cars as they pass me by
And I'm trying not to look a row behind me
'Cause Jason's got his ass on the glass
And I hate him‚ driver hit a bump fast
[Pre-Chorus]
I know the driver sees it
I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror
He says nothing
Trying to ignore it, it's fucking boring
I'm quietly observing, I'm saying nothing
[Chorus]
No one's watching us, don't give a fuck
Wheels on the bus
I'm holding it down up in the front
Wheels on the bus
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Wheels on the bus
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh
Wheels on the, on the bus
Ooh, ha, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh
Wheels on the bus
[Chorus]
No one's watching us, don't give a fuck
Wheels on the bus
I'm holding it down up in the front
Wheels on the bus
Ooh (Wheels on the bus)
Ooh (Wheels on the bus)
Ooh
Wheels on the bus
