[Verse 1: Melanie Martinez]
Over my shoulder, eyes peeking in
Analyze my every move, what current state I'm in
'Cause you are colder (brrr) than ice on my skin
Wanna get that A+, baby, so you take my shit
'
Cause I am little, right? I won't call you out
Teachers saying you'd get credit, (good job!) why would you stop now?
You are so desperate, craving that spotlight
Shine it on the ones who do that shit, 'cause it's their life
[Pre-Chorus: Melanie Martinez]
But I know the people around you say
"Just do what it takes to make it all the way"
[Chorus: Melanie Martinez]
You're a copy cat
And you take it then you leave it
Honey, just like that, just like that
You're falling flat
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
Up right back
[Post-Chorus]
(
Copy cat, copy cat
)
[Verse 2: Melanie Martinez]
Obsessed with power, you want it for yourself
Feeding on misogyny
But still, you call yourself a feminista
If that were really true
You wouldn't feel as if I were a current threat to you
[Pre-Chorus: Melanie Martinez]
But I know the people around you say
"Just do what it takes to make it all the way"
[Chorus: Melanie Martinez]
You're a copy cat
And you take it then you leave it
Honey, just like that, just like that
You're falling flat
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
Up right back
[Post-Chorus]
(
Copy cat, copy cat
)
[Bridge: Melanie Martinez]
Find someone else to leech on, lady
My blood's for me, not for you, baby
College estate and all your savings
My blood's for me, so no more taking
[Verse 3: Tierra Whack]
Anything you can do, I can do better
Imprisoned for stealing, gon' write you a letter
Courageous and clever, creative director
I raised the bar high, yes sir, I broke the record
I'm hot as peppers, my words are in leather
Scuffed up my boots, boy, I'll stomp you in Skechers
They wanna build like their first name is Hector
Back against wall, bitch, I am a projector
From the projects, don't check on my ex
Think you're the boss, then I'll break broken necks
Wish you the best, won't show you my next move
So, I guess you'll be upset
Don't cry, no baby, you'll find your own way
Think for yourself, it'll all be okay
Copyright lyrics, you can't steal my spirit
They live for my music, they're dyin' to hear it
Imitated, never duplicated
You wish you related
You wish you'd have made it
Imitated, never duplicated
You wish you related
You wish you'd have made it
[Chorus: Melanie Martinez]
You're a copy cat
You take it then you leave it
Honey, just like that, just like that
You're falling flat
You find someone like me to bring you up right back
Up right back
[Post-Chorus]
(
Copy cat, copy cat
)
