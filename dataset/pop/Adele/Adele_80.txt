[Verse 1]
Count up your portion, count up your checks
Feeding your fam while you're comin’ at my neck
When you gonna freeze with the cruel dramatics?
I'm not inspired by your foolish practice
Butter your bullshit, set up your fence
I'm just the chicken giving you the egg
Soon you’re gonna see that your breath was wasted
Don't speak too soon on your doubts, you're making
A big deal out of a little thing
[Pre-Chorus]
Why should I try to conform to formulated paths, when
Clearly all my instincts led to something more magical?
[Chorus]
Am I just a number? 'Cause it seems like that's your goal
You push us past our limits just to watch decimals grow
Oh, I need a reason why I'm looked at like a joke
Until I prove you wrong like I've done time and time before, and
All your idle teachings and your criticism lack
The potential to penetrate my solid golden path
To decide what my future is, I'm my own clairvoyant
There’s no controlling me, imagination on ascend
[Verse 2]
Take me to Venus, let me explode
I’m ready to pop like a volcano
Jump over me like you're playing hot lava
Emotions on one hundred thousand, who’s gonna
Shake me like soda creme?
But of course
Use all your words to distract from the source
Of where all the growth on the paper happens
Leave me alone to my own concoction
[Pre-Chorus]
Prickin' all my fingertips to carve out many roads
Pushin' out the petals from the bud of what I know
[Chorus]
Am I just a number? 'Cause it seems like that’s your goal
You push us past our limits just to watch decimals grow
Oh, I need a reason why I'm looked at like a joke
Until I prove you wrong like I've done time and time before, and
All my intuition says is expansion comes first, but
Not just by material, I'm talkin' 'bout in here
My heart space and my cranium must be loved too, my dear
Don't push me to the edge until I'm useless and can't feel
[Bridge]
They replaced their search for knowledge
With the reach of many material gains
They lack the tenderness of the sensitive
Empathetic bodies cryin' from the pain
It's too late to grow their frame of mind
It seems that it's already made
No use in arguin' with someone who doesn't
Wanna prioritize birthing of creation
Am I just a number?
Am I just a number?
Am I just a number?
Am I just a number?
[Chorus]
Am I just a number? 'Cause it seems like that's your goal
You push us past our limits just to watch our numbers grow
Oh, I need a reason why I'm looked at like a joke
Until I prove you wrong which I've done time and time before, and
All my intuition says is expansion comes first, but
Not just by material, I'm talkin' 'bout in here
My heart space and my cranium must be loved too, my dear
Don't push me to the edge until I'm useless and can't feel
