[Verse 1]
I know you've got things to do (I do, too)
I just wanna spend all my time with you (It feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress, don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party, I'm just excited to get home
[Chorus]
And dream about you
All night long
[Verse 2]
I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happenin' so easily (Like, oh, my God)
It's so hard to digest, usually, I'm best alone
But every time that you text, I want to get on the next flight home
[Chorus]
And dream next to you
All night long
[Verse 3]
Maybe it's the way you remind me of (Where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (And thеn some)
The sight of you is dramatic, one glimpsе and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours 'cause you possess powers I can't fight
[Chorus]
That's why I dream about you
All night long
All night long
All night
