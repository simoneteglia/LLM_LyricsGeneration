[Intro]
Follow the tunnel into the portal
Lay all your burdens to rest
Drink from the fountain, death's holy water
Watch as you're put to the test
[Verse 1]
I make them panic, it's satanic
How I bend my body
Yeah, you can look, but you can't touch
I'm not just anybody
Caught in a haze and hypnotized and you're too thirsty
Open your view
and you will find
Stop searching
[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes on the prize
Thought the cherry would be better than the pie
You like that, like that, that, like that
That's your demise
Yeah, you hold me like you're rushing to my thighs
Too fast, too fast, fast, too fast
[Chorus]
But your focus is empty
Tunnel vision, thеn dead me
Honeysucklе and fresh meat
But I'm more than that, more than that
Playing house to distract me
But you're no good at acting
Obvious what you're after
And I'm more than that, more than that
And I'm more than that, more than that
[Verse 2]
They always hustle for the pussy so they'll never get it
I make them tumble down the hill they climbed, I don't regret it
I saw that trick fall out your sleeve and I'm so certain
You hum a tune I don't believe and it ain't workin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Eyes on the prize
Thought the cherry would be better than the pie
You like that, like that, that, like that
That's your demise
Yeah, you hold me like you're rushing to my thighs
Too fast, too fast, fast, too fast
[Chorus]
But your focus is empty
Tunnel vision, then dead me
Honeysuckle and fresh meat
But I'm more than that, more than that
Playing house to distract me
But you're no good at acting
Obvious what you're after
And I'm more than that, more than that
And I'm more than that, more than that
[Outro]
Crossing my heart, I'd rather die (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Than be the needle in your eye (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Show me how far obsession goes (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Could've been more, now we'll never know
