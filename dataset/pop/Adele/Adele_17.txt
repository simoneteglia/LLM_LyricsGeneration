[Verse 1]
You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over, there's some games you wanna play
I'm walkin' to your house, nobody's home
Just me and you and you and me alone
[Pre-Chorus]
We're just playin' hide and seek
It's gettin' hard to breathe
Under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasin'
Chasin' after you
[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a playdate to you
[Verse 2]
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothin' left to say
When I try to talk, you're always playin' board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
[Pre-Chorus]
We're just playin' hide and seek
It's gettin' hard to breathe
Under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasin'
Chasin' after you
[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a playdate to you
[Bridge]
Ring around the Rosie
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the Rosie
I wanna give you, wanna give you what you need
[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a playdate to you
[Outro]
You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't wanna leave this playdate with you
