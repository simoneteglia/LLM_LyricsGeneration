[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
[Verse 2]
Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mmm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
[Bridge]
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
[Chorus]
So, I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
[Outro]
Come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
