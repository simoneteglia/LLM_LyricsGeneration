[Verse 1]
You called the other day, I stayed away
I left your shit on read four times today
And it felt like bliss, used to miss your kiss
Now I'm hop, skip, jumpin' over narcissists
Throwing all your stuff into the abyss
Now the role is reversed, told you I'm a switch
How you like my spit?
That's for all the piss that you left me in
See the horns on my head? They're from goddesses, goddesses
On God
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I never knew what it meant
What it meant to be content with you
Everything I expressed, I professed
It nеver quite made it through
Said it's all in my hеad, all in my head
Whenever I spoke my truth
No, I won't defend you to all my friends
This time I refuse
[Chorus]
If you bite my hand again
I will never feed you
You can call me evil
Take it to the grave if you wanna play pretend
I won't be mistreated
Please call me conceited
Took me way too long to put this to bed
Lovin' you was lethal
Guess that makes me evil, evil
[Post-Chorus]
Evil, evil, evil
[Verse 2]
Remember when you smiled right to my face?
As all my little tears of oxalate
They made a shape, revealed a snake
Now I'm stop-drop-rollin' over all your jokes
Every time you tell a lie, I'm prayin' that you choke
Should've listened to the signs and the horoscopes
Hope you never cope, hope you slip on soap
Crack your head like an egg, wanna see the yolk
You were such a hoax
[Pre-Chorus]
No, I never knew what it meant
What it meant to be content with you
Everything I expressed, I professed
It never quite made it through
Said it's all in my head, all in my head
Whenever I spoke my truth
No, I won't defend you to all my friends
This time I refuse
[Chorus]
If you bite my hand again
I will never feed you
You can call me evil
Take it to the grave if you wanna play pretend
I won't be mistreated
Please call me conceited
Took me way too long to put this to bed
Lovin' you was lethal
Guess that makes me evil, evil
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
If you bite my hand again
I will never feed you
You can call me evil
Take it to the grave if you wanna play pretend
I won't be mistreated
Please call me conceited
Took me way too long to put this to bed
Lovin' you was lethal
Guess that makes me evil, evil
[Post-Chorus]
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
[Outro]
Lovin' you was lethal
Guess that makes me evil
