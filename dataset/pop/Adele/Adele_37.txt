[Verse 1]
Did my invitations disappear?
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever
[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
[Verse 2]
Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
Or told them decorations were in pastel ribbons
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
Forever, forever
[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
[Bridge]
I'm laughin', I'm cryin'
It feels like I'm dyin'
I'm laughin', I'm cryin'
It feels like I'm dyin'
I'm laughin', I'm cryin'
It feels like I'm dyin'
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
[Interlude]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to (If I want to, If I want to)
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
[Scream]
[Chorus]
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
[Outro]
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry)
