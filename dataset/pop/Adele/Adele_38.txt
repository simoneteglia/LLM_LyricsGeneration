[Verse 1]
Don't cut me, punch me, just let me go
Into the nurse’s office where I float away
I'm pale as the loose-leaf paper they grow
From hollowing out all my lungs in the snow
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm coughing
I’m bleeding, Band-Aids won't heal it
'Cause they hate me, so I'm fakin'
All of, of this so they take-take me
[Chorus]
Take me ho-o-ome
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is o-o-old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Teacher, can I sit right there?
This bitch behind me is cutting my hair
"No, just sit your ass down at the chalkboard, you stare"
I faked up a seizure and left then and there
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm coughing
I'm bleeding, Band-Aids won’t heal it
’Cause they hate me, so I'm fakin’
All of, of this so they take-take me
[Chorus]
Take me ho-o-ome
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is o-o-old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Take me ho-o-ome
Give me that pink slip of permission
This is o-o-old
I'm tired of wishing I was ditching
Home
Old
