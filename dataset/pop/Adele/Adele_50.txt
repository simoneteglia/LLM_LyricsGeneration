[Verse 1]
It was the middle of class and the teacher wasn't lookin'
Kelly  had a fat ass and trouble was cookin'
She  had a boy wrapped around her finger tight
I fell in love with him, but he wasn't in my life
The teacher gave me notes to go out and give Kelly
She  was kissin' Brendon, I got jelly
I  wanted to be in her shoes for one day
I just waited 'til recess to make her pay (Make her pay)
[Chorus]
Mommy,  why do I feel sad?
Should I give him away or feel this bad?
"No, no, no, don't you choke"
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For  the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
[Post-Chorus]
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat" (Class fight)
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat" (Class fight)
[Verse 2]
Her face was fucked up and my hands were bloody
We were in the playground, things were getting muddy
The teacher broke us up after I broke her
And my one true love called me a monster
[Chorus]
Mommy, why do I feel sad?
Should I give him away or feel this bad?
"No, no, no, don't you choke"
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
[Post-Chorus]
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat" (Class fight)
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat"
For the throat, for, for the throat
Daddy chimed in, "Go for the throat" (Class fight)
