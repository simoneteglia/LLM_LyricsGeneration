[Verse 1]
Twisted all my limbs for you
Two of them in knots and two of them in loops
Ribbons tied around like a noose
Wonder if I'll ever get it loose
I don't wanna bruise for you
Holding back my words until my face is blue (Huh)
I don't really care 'bout your crew
You can tell 'em what you wanted to
[Pre-Chorus]
(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Pushin' me
(Body's touching, body's touching) Lovin' me
(Blood is pumping, blood is pumping) Pullin' me
(Feelin' nothing, feelin' nothing) Fuckin' me
(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Crushin' me
(Body's touching, body's touching) Touchin' me
Wah
!
[Chorus]
I'm done, I'm done
Done doing backbends, I break and I snap
It's no fun, no fun
Pushed myself into a box while you held out a gun
I'm done! Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!
I'm done, I'm done!
Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!
[Verse 2]
Twistin' all my bones like screws
Stretchin' my self-worth, just like you usually do
Caught you like the cold or a flu (Achoo!)
Praying that I'll someday be immune
Got me like a bad tattoo
Always under skin, even when it gets removed
Never got a chance to undo
Positions that you forced my way into
[Pre-Chorus]
(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Pushin' me
(Body's touching, body's touching) Lovin' me
(Blood is pumping, blood is pumping) Pullin' me
(Feelin' nothing, feelin' nothing) Fuckin' me
(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Crushin' me
(Body's touching, body's touching) Touchin' me
Ow!
[Chorus]
I'm done, I'm done
Done doing backbends, I break and I snap
It's no fun, no fun
Pushed myself into a box while you held out a gun
I'm done! Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!
I'm done, I'm done! Wah ha ha ha ha ha hah!
[Post-Chorus]
(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Pushin' me
(Body's touching, body's touching) Lovin' me
(Blood is pumping, blood is pumping) Pullin' me
(Feelin' nothing, feelin' nothing) Fuckin' me
(Bones are crushing, bones are crushing) Crushin' me
(Body's touching, body's touching) Touchin' me
(Blood is pumping, blood is)
Ow!
