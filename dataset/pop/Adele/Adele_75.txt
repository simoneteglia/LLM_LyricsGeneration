Classic‬
‪
The Queen to the Motherland‬
‪On the other hand‬
[Verse 1: Davido]
‪She said, "Come if you wanna" (Oh)
‪I said, "I know myself, I'm gonna wanna"
‪Activate undercover, so let me know ‬
‪She say, "Nwannem biko"
‪Activate if you wanna
Let her know it's not the normal size
‪This kind thing go make your ship capsize
‪So let me know if you wanna ride
[Chorus: Davido]
‪She call me brother, ‪I call her sister, too
‪Mama so fine, she got like six tattoos ‬
‪If she was a city, she be Timbuktu ‬
‪My holy ground wey me I run to
‪Brother, ‪I call her sister, too
‪Mama so fine, she got like six tattoos ‬
‪If she was a city, she be Timbuktu ‬
‪My holy ground wey me I run to‬
‪My holy ground wey me I run to
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj &

‪I said, "Come if you wanna" (
Oh
)
‪Got the drink, the marijuana
‪Let me know whenever you decide
‪Let me know, you put them bitches to the side, yeah
‪It's you on my mind, it's you all the time
‪You came just in time, you gave me my—
‪Spit on the mic, something you could bump to
‪Get nasty for you every time you come through
‪Finish line, who you run to?
‪Keep you grounded, I holy ground you
Ayo, ‪I'm giving medals, I gotta give you the G
‪I'm bouncing all on the D‬
‪I just had to give you the V‬
‪
Hair blowing all in the wind ‬while we cruising, Penelope
‪Nigeria to the world, and “Fuck you” to my enemies
[Chorus: Davido]
‪She call me brother, ‪I call her sister, too
‪Mama so fine, she got like six tattoos ‬
‪If she was a city, she be Timbuktu ‬
‪My holy ground wey me I run to
‪Brother, ‪I call her sister, too
‪Mama so fine, she got like six tattoos ‬
‪If she was a city, she be Timbuktu ‬
‪My holy ground wey my I run to
‪My holy ground wey me I run to
[Outro: Nicki Minaj &
Davido

‪Spit on the mic, something we could bump to
‪Get nasty for you every time you come through
‪Finish line, who you run to?
Keep you grounded

My holy ground wey me I run to
