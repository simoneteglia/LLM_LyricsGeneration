[Chorus]
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
[Verse 1]
When I walk in a room, I'm invisible, I feel like a ghost
All my friends keep on tellin' me that this feeling won't last, mmm
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself, I swear I'm dead in the eyes
I have nothin' to feel no more, I can't even cry
[Pre-Chorus]
When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper-thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared
[Chorus]
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
[Verse 2]
When I wake up, I'm afraid of the idea of facin' the day
I would rather stay home on my own, drink it all away
Please stop callin' me, it's exhausting, there's really nothin' left to say
I created this storm, it's only fair I have to sit in its rain
[Pre-Chorus]
When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper-thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared
[Chorus]
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
All love is devout, no feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now before it's too late
In the end, it's just you, stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it
[Chorus]
Cry your heart out (Cry, yeah), it'll clean your face
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace
