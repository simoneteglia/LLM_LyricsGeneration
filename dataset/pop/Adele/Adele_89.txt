[Verse 1]
"Why you always act so serious?"
I said, "Baby boy, you know I'm on my period," yuh
He bit the cherry down, he’s delirious
Seein' red figures in his mirrors and
Actin' like a real tough, furious
Blood-swimmin’ turned him amphibious
He says he doesn't care, that he's into this
It happens every time a new season hits
[Chorus]
Skin ready for my heavy daily creme, I keep it handy
Womb shedding any lessons, making room for blessings
Juice melting like raspberry, pomegranate
It's so scary how my aura got him howling at my moon cycle, baby
[Verse 2]
Now he kissin' on the ground that I walk on
Tryna get another taste, but I'm all crampеd up
Pain like a blade on the front lawn
But I don't givе a fuck 'cause I’m so strong
I don’t gotta act, I'm Ethereous
I could win a fight on my period
Matter of fact, right now, I could build a pyramid
You messin’ with my cycle, that is dangerous
[Chorus]
Skin ready for my heavy daily creme, I keep it handy
Womb shedding any lessons, making room for blessings
Juice melting like raspberry, pomegranate
It's so scary how my aura got him howling at my moon cycle, baby
[Outro]
Moon cycle, baby
Moon cycle, baby
Moon cycle, baby
Moon cycle, baby
