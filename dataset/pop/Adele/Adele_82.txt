[Intro]
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
[Verse 1]
Don't wanna know where you go when you're aren't around
Rather stay naive, too much to believe
Blood falling out from your nose and I'm wonderin', "How?"
You glamorize your pain, wear it on display
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's a cry for help, go help yourself
I've opened a million doors, you never go
It's past point of no return, when will we learn?
Alert me, when this shit is over
[Chorus]
Lying loud (Through it all)
Cut your face (From the fall)
When you're hurt (Who'd you call?)
I can't answer now
Spent the rent (On a high)
Onе-way street (To the scythe)
Clean it up (Watch you diе)
It's yours to decide
[Post-Chorus]
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
[Verse 2]
Show me a picture you paint of someone else
Lived a double life, wish I was surprised
Eyes rollin' back to your head, and I'm wonderin', "How?"
I recognize your face, put it all to waste
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's a cry for help, go help yourself
I've opened a million doors, you never go
It's past point of no return, when will we learn?
Alert me when this shit is over
[Chorus]
Lying loud (Through it all)
Cut your face (From the fall)
When you're hurt (Who'd you call?)
I can't answer now
Spent the rent (On a high)
One-way street (To the scythe)
Clean it up (Watch you die)
It's yours to decide
[Post-Chorus]
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's a cry for help, go help yourself
I've opened a million doors, you never go
It's past point of no return, when will we learn?
Alert me, when this shit is over
[Chorus]
Lying loud (Through it all)
Cut your face (From the fall)
When you're hurt (Who'd you call?)
I can't answer now
Spent the rent (On a high)
One-way street (To the scythe)
Clean it up (Watch you die)
It's yours to decide
[Post-Chorus]
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
Powder, pow-pow-powder
