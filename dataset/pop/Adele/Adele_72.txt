[Intro]
Haha
Woo
[Verse 1]
Hey God, I'll be the jester
Entertain ya to the best of
My ability, when I suffer, no
Fragility
when I enter
Came here for a reason
, ah-ah
So stop complaining
All have offseasons, ah-ah
It's not just a joke or a lesson to live through
Every which way and second is a breakthrough
[Chorus]
I'm mortal
, ah-ah-ah
Defected by this form
, ah-ah-ah
So I'd rather be tested by goddesses resting
Their heads up on pillows of all they have learned
[Verse 2]
I'm not to be forgottеn
Drop your books when I walk in
Magic talks without talking
I make the most bеfore the coffin
Born to be desiring, ah-ah
Gotta learn, yeah, eyes are always on the next goal
But space isn't there to always be filled up
It's the quiet, the downtime to breathe in my lungs
[Chorus]
'Cause
I'm mortal
, ah-ah-ah
Defected by this form, ah-ah-ah
So I beg to be tested by goddesses resting
Their heads up on pillows of all they have learned
'Cause
I'm mortal
, ah-ah-ah
Test me,
I'm mortal
, ah-ah-ah
And I beg to be tested by goddesses resting
Their heads up on pillows of all they have learned
'Cause
I'm mortal
, ah-ah-ah
Defected by this form, ah-ah-ah
And I beg to be tested by goddesses resting
Their heads upon pillows of all they have learned
[Outro]
'Cause
I'm mortal
, ah-ah-ah (Give me an A-plus if I'm doing this thing right)
Defected by this form, ah-ah-ah
And I'd rather be tested by goddesses resting
Their heads up on pillows of all they have learned
