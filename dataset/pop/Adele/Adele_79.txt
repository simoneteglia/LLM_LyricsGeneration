[Verse 1]
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye,
and a heaviness in my head
[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
[Verse 2]
When was the last time that you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know
[Pre-Chorus]
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
[Chorus]
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
[Bridge]
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
[Chorus]
Why don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
[Outro]
When will I see you again?
