[Verse 1]
You know I'm not one to take orders from ya
I'll drop another clue for you, peek-a-boo, now do you get it?
You always wonder why I just say, "Forget it"
'Cause talking to a brick wall give me headaches, headaches
[Pre-Chorus]
Spread your lies while I stretch
Spread my legs and do the splits
Yell at me on your screen
While I send love to your being
You're not real, just like me
We were never our bodies
We're just us, energy
Hot likе melting icy cream
[Chorus]
Tryna bring the mystical into thе material
Bitch, I'm an eleven Life Path, I'm ethereal
I'm the definition of dichotomy, duality
Katarina in the womb for nine months 'til she birthed me
Look at her, she's a bridge, and on her bridge, I'll take a shit
Fuck it up, you get lit, let's get deep, if not, I'll dip
I be ridin' solo on my field trip
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I'm never gonna be what you had envisioned
You say blanquitas feel more Latina than you, ¿ahora lo entiendes?
You always say you're woke, it's your aesthetic
But is your empathy actually authentic? Is it?
[Pre-Chorus]
I am shy, but I do speak only when I truly need
To say some shit that hopefully
Will reach the ears it's supposed to be
I try my best to show them me, my risin' sign is all they see
Scorpio bitch with a sharp-ass sting
I got a Taurus sun, moon Mercury
[Chorus]
Tryna bring the mystical into the material
Bitch, I'm an eleven Life Path, I'm ethereal
I'm the definition of dichotomy, duality
Katarina in the womb for nine months 'til she birthed me
Look at her, she's a bridge, and on her bridge, I'll take a shit
Fuck it up, you get lit, let's get deep, if not, I'll dip
I be ridin' solo on my field trip
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
