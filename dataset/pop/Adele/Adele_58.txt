[Verse 1]
I was too young to see the truth
In my grandma's lap, I'm drownin' in her perfume
Too naive to even care
'Bout the words she whispered while she brushed out my hair
[Pre-Chorus]
People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)
[Chorus]
Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (Ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say, "Recess, I'm tired"
[Verse 2]
Sittin' in my room, lookin' at all I've done
Everything I wanted has come to fruition
I should be happy, but I can't get out my bed
Stressin' 'bout the voices screamin' inside my head
[Pre-Chorus]
People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)
[Chorus]
Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (Ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say "Recess, I'm tired"
[Bridge]
Where has my time gone
And my mind gone?
I can't find euphoria
When I get upset
I think in my head
Back to what she said
[Pre-Chorus]
People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)
[Chorus]
Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (Ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say "Recess, I'm tired"
