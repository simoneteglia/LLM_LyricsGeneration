[Intro]
Write this down, baby
[Verse 1]
I'm not physically fulfilled, you never held it down all night
And you're selfish 'cause you always think your ass is always right
And you never see the lesson when it's right in front your eyes
Are you writing this shit down? 'Cause baby boy, I think it's time
[Pre-Chorus]
Time you learned a thing or two
'Bout how to keep a girl like me with you
Time you learned how to switch it up
I'm tired of ridin' 'til you just give up
'Cause I didn't sign up for this
Actin' like your time's more valuable
When I sacrificed blood for you
I sacrificed blood
[Chorus]
Write this shit in your notebook, baby
Since you never wrote lovе letters to me, to mе
Don't forget all the things I've taught you
You'll need it for someone who isn't me, ain't me
[Verse 2]
What's the point in your "I love yous" when they don't hold any weight?
You touch your computer much more than you have ever touched me
Every night you come back home, then you just go back to sleep
Laying next to just a friend who occasionally fucks me
[Pre-Chorus]
Time you know just how I feel
Since you threw me away forever
Time you start growing up
Age is nothing if you're not evolved
Yeah, I didn't have time for this
But I still gave you my all
I sacrificed blood for you
I sacrificed blood
[Chorus]
Write this shit in your notebook, baby
Since you never wrote love letters to me, to me
Don't forget all the things I've taught you
You'll need it for someone who isn't me, ain't me
