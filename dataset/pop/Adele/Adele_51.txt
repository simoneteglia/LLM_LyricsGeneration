[Part 1: NYMPHOLOGY]
[Verse 1]
Call me your nymph
Praise me for martyr, praise me for sin
Call me your muse
A sprite or an elf you cry to then use
[Pre-Chorus]
I will not suffer, ah-ah
Cry under covers, ah-ah
I'm not your mother, ah-ah
Ah-ah
[Chorus]
It's nymphology, not psychology
Be the manic pixie dream girl that you fucking ought to be
Damaged oddity bought by Sotheby's
Auctioned to a selfish man who thinks that he's the prophecy
[Post-Chorus]
You can't even spell but you're an "expert" in nymphology
N-Y-M-P-H-O-L-O-G-Y, that's nymphology
[Verse 2]
I'm not fiction, I'm not fae
I won't lick your wounds today
But I'll throw you in the ring
Gift you with my suffering
I'm not crazy, I'm not wild
You're just stupid, little child
Get your image off my back
I'll give you a heart attack
[Pre-Chorus]
I will not suffer, ah-ah
Cry under covers, ah-ah
I'm not your mother, ah-ah
Ah-ah
[Chorus]
It's nymphology, not psychology
Be the manic pixie dream girl that you fuckin' ought to be
Damaged oddity bought by Sotheby's
Auctioned to a selfish man who thinks that he's the prophecy
[Post-Chorus]
You can't even spell but you're an "expert" in nymphology
N-Y-M-P-H-O-L-O-G-Y, that's nymphology
[Bridge]
Don't treat me that way, yeah
You're actin' like a wannabe
I won't be ashamed, yeah
For lovin' you so honestly
You're in a spell and it worked
And I'm returnin' the hurt
I'm kicking your ass out
Flutter my wings while I pout
Push your penis into your mouth
I'll make you choke on your doubt
Cut you off, watch you die
Just a fairy with a knife
[Chorus]
It's nymphology, not psychology
Be the manic pixie dream girl that you fucking ought to be
Damaged oddity bought by Sotheby's
Auctioned to a selfish man who thinks that he's the prophecy
[Post-Chorus]
Call me your nymph
You can't even spell but you're an "expert" in nymphology
Call me your nymph
N-Y-M-P-H-O-L-O-G-Y, that's nymphology
[Part 2: AMULET]
[Verse]
Diamonds and rubies, the star in all the movies
Wears me out, big pockets
I am her favorite locket
, keeps them droolin'
The semi-precious stones ain't as cold and they're curious
Where did I get refined, get my cuts, and my polishes?
I am too many karats for your budget, ask the jeweler
Your boyfriend tried me on, wore me out, made him cooler
Like Moldavite
or Emeralds from Colombian Andes
It will be the brightest, the brightest green you've ever seen
Ancient and it's protective, an expensive rarity
So rare, it is offensive, I think you will agree
