[Verse 1]
You are the light, I've been searchin' for forever
Feels like, man, I've really never felt the rain
Buried in the desert, didn't think I'd push through the dirt
You just cleansed me like a waterfall, you came
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm screamin' like a kettle on a stove
You cranked the heat up, I was cold
My past grew mold around my heart
And all my anger, sadness, regret, disappeared, it's madness
I'm not used to all this watеr, love, it's true
[Chorus]
But you make mе want to
Plan out my last days on earth, eating you
Ooh-ooh-ooh
The tips of your teeth fit perfect in me
You're the shower of light I devour any day of the week
Baby, cleanse me
[Verse 2]
I was surprised to see heaven in your eyes
I never once was treated right, you're what I'm missing in my life
As bright as the sun, give me your vitamin D
Let's run into another dimension
You make me feel like I'm on drugs
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm screamin' like a kettle on a stove
You crank the heat up, I was cold
My past grew mold around my heart
And all my anger, sadness, regret disappeared, it's madness
I'm not used to all this water, love, it's true
[Chorus]
But you make me want to
Plan out my last days on earth, eating you
Ooh-ooh-ooh
The tips of your teeth fit perfect in me
You're the shower of light I devour any day of the week
Baby, cleanse me
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
But you make me want to
Plan out my last days on earth, eating you
Ooh-ooh-ooh
The tips of your teeth fit perfect in me
You're the shower of light I devour any day of the week
(Baby, cleanse me)
