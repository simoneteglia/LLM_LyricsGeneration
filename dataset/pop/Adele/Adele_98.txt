[Intro]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
[Verse 1]
A seed in mother and I chose that space for me
Little does she know it's free, ooh, yeah
I'm undercover, as they wait for joy, I cry
On a mission, learn and die, ooh, yeah
And I know my brother, he'll make the journey later on
Conversations in the cosmos, yeah
And it's all a game now, but once I'm in the world, it's lost
Memories gone to evolve, ooh, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Mergin' cells and flesh
I'm baby-building all my insides right to see the future
Right before my eyes
, I know
What's comin', what's comin'
[Chorus]
In the womb, get me out now, safe and I'm sound
Cut the cord, I'm comin'
Out the blue, belly water too, hot and cold
Through with it, oh, now she's birthin'
Feelin' alive the closer that I get to my life
I'm pushin' out the center, the core
I'm swimmin' through the flower no more, no more
[Verse 2]
All of the planning, yet I still feel unprepared
Kickin', screamin' 'cause I'm scared, ooh, yeah
And I know she suffers contractions of hell and death
Eyes are bloody, screamin' out, ooh, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Mergin' spirit, mind, and body
Buildin' all my insides right to see the future
Right before my eyes,
I know
What's comin', what's comin'
[Chorus]
In the womb, get me out now, safe and I'm sound
Cut the cord, I'm comin'
Out the blue, belly water too, hot and cold
Through with it, oh, now she's birthin'
Feelin' alive the closer that I get to my life
I'm pushin' out the center, the core
I'm swimmin' through the flower no more, no more
[Outro]
Life is death is life is death is life isâ€”
