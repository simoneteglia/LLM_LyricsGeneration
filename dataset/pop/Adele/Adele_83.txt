[Verse 1]
I'm glued to the thoughts in my mind (Mind)
They pester like a hawk in the sky
I am glued to the love in you (In you)
It swallows me whole, you're hard to let go, oh
That's not what I wanna do (No, no)
Perfectly attached like a noodle in a soup (Huh?)
You're good with the X-Y-Z (Y-Z)
I'm good with the A-B-C
And D-E-F-G, H-I-J-K, baby
We all have our strong suits, built differently
Different experience, different needs
I know we can't die at the same time, but please
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna think about the morbid parts of lifе no more
I'm trying just to focus on the things that hold me so damn closе
I'm sticky, sticky, stuck and solidly sealed up to this reality
I'm seeing not what I wish to be achieving, the old idea of me is
[Chorus]
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless
I'm stuck in the vortex, stuck in the vortex
Glue-less, life would be boring
Empty, but no hurting
Is it necessary? Detachment is scary
[Verse 2]
When my pretty feet start to sway (Sway)
You better turn around the other way (Walk away)
But when the doubt starts creeping in (Oh no)
It's hard to let go of old instinctual
[Pre-Chorus]
Patterns that I picked up from my environment since a baby
Cut the negative self-talk and cut out my procrastination
Being sticky stuck, glue those old habits shut
Paste me to a new way of being something to breathe new life in me again
[Chorus]
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless
I'm stuck in the vortex, stuck in the vortex
Glue-less, life would be boring
Empty, but no hurting (No hurting, no)
Is it necessary? Detachment is scary
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless, oh, clueless, oh
Glue-less, life would be boring
Empty, but no hurting, hurting, no
[Outro]
Glued up, sometimes it's too much
I'm fucked up and clueless (Clueless, I am clueless)
Glue-less, life would be boring
Empty, but no hurting (Is it necessary? Detachment is scary)
