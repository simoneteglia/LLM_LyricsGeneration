[Intro]
In the void, in the void
In the void, in the void
In the void, in the void
In the void, in the void
In the void
[Verse 1]
Baby
I'm spinnin’ 'round the corner
It's tasting kinda lonely
And my mind wants to control me
E-e-e-empty
There’s rotten things left in me
Injected by society
No one here but me to judge me
[Pre-Chorus]
Pipe down with the noise, I cannot bear my sorrow
I hate who I was before
I fear I won't live to see the day tomorrow
Someone tell me if this is Hell
[Chorus]
I gotta escape that void
There is no other choice, yeah
Tryna turn down the voices
The void ate me
Look at the mess I've done
There is nowhere to run, yeah
Holdin' a loaded gun
The void
Like a priest behind confession walls, I judge myself
Kneeling on a metal grater
Bloody like a body that has died and it's myself
Tangled in my own intestines
I gotta escape the void
There is no other choice, yeah
Gotta escape the void
[Verse 2]
So strange
I'm tryna find a doorway
My eyes are starin' at me
And they seem so damn unhappy
C-c-c-collect
My fickle insecurities
And turn them into beauty
Alchemize the dark within me-ee (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Pipe down with the noise, I cannot bear my sorrow
I hate who I was before
I fear I won't live to see the day tomorrow
Someone tell me if this is Hell
[Chorus]
I gotta escape that void
There is no other choice, yeah
Tryna turn down the voices
The void ate me
Look at the mess I’ve done
There is nowhere to run, yeah
Holdin’ a loaded gun
The void
Like a priest behind confession walls, I judge myself
Kneeling on a metal grater
Bloody like a body that has died and it's myself
Tangled in my own intestines
I gotta escape that void
There is no other choice, yeah
Tryna turn down the voices
The void ate me
Look at the mess I’ve done
There is nowhere to run, yeah
Holdin' a loaded gun
The void
