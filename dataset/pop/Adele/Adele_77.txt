[Verse 1]
Help me when I'm at a loss for words
Bring up all my memories folder please, in the temporal lobe
False loving when I was illogical
Didn't know they held each other's hands 'cause they made one whole
[Pre-Chorus]
Brain stem yells temperature
Arise now, sweat raindrops down my silky flesh
Buttering up my consciousness
Cook, cook, cook now
Ability to sleep sound
Throughout the star, time's an illusion
If you just remove it
[Chorus]
When did humans start to separate brain and heart
As if they could stay alive alone?
Flip it around the other way
If they were apart and you had no power start
Or no database
Only your shell remains
What fun is it to be so calculated
Or be taken advantage of 'cause your heart's too trusting?
Silent expressed, push my head into my chest
Bind them up, forever wed
"Don't drift too far," they said
[Verse 2]
Help me when I'm too detached and cold
Give me the vitality that I need to trust love more
Blood to the water, neither can fuel us alone
Fervency in my arteries, passion bloomin' through my bones
[Pre-Chorus]
Heartstrings trigger emotions, dreams
Agape love's a journey, red rivers connect all of me
B-b-beat steadfast, don't you disappoint me
Sometimes I think you're all I need
Wise beyond belief
[Chorus]
When did humans start to separate brain and heart
As if they could stay alive alone?
Flip it around the other way
If they were apart and you had no power start
Or no database
Only your shell remains
What fun is it to be so calculated
Or be taken advantage of 'cause your heart's too trusting?
Silent expressed, push my head into my chest
Bind them up, forever wed
"Don't drift too far," they said
