[Chorus]
'Round and 'round like a horse on a carousel we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasin' after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
[Verse 1]
Come, come one, come all
You must be this tall
To ride this ride
At the carnival
Oh, come take my hand
And run through playland
So high, too high
At the carnival
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now
[Chorus]
'Round and 'round like a horse on a carousel we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasin' after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
[Verse 2]
This horse is too slow
We're always this close
Almost, almost
We're a freak show
Right, right when I'm near
It's like you disappear
Where'd you go?
Mr. Houdini, you're a freak show
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now
[Chorus]
'Round and 'round like a horse on a carousel we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasin' after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
[Bridge]
Why did you steal my cotton candy heart?
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I'm stuck, oh, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding
[Chorus]
'Round and 'round like a horse on a carousel we go
Will I catch up to love? I can never tell
I know chasin' after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
