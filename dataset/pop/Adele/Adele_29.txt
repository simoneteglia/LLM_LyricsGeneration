[Verse 1]
Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girl's hand
That basic bitch leaves finally
Now I can take her man
[Pre-Chorus]
Someone told me, "Stay away from things that aren't yours"
But was he yours if he wanted me so bad?
[Chorus]
Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words
Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words
[Post-Chorus]
(Words, words)
[Verse 2]
I can't stand her whining
Where's her binky now?
And lovin' her seems tiring
So, boy, just love me, down, down, down
[Pre-Chorus]
Someone told me, "Stay away from things that aren't yours"
But was he yours if he wanted me so bad?
[Chorus]
Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words
Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words
[Post-Chorus]
(Words, words)
[Bridge]
Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words
[Chorus]
Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words
Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words
[Post-Chorus]
(Words, words)
