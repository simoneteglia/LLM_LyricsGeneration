[Intro]
Oh-oh no, oh-oh no
Oh-oh no, oh-oh no
[Verse 1]
They said, "Hey, girl, will you sit with me?
Table in the back, Cafeteria C
We can be friends if you want to be
But only 'til the clock hits three
After lunch, we can walk to class
Talk about the boys that we want to smash
Talk about ways to get a little more cash
After that I'll ignore your ass," oh
[Pre-Chorus]
The hassle, the fightin', they all want a bite of me
Photos, more photos
Then gossip 'bout hoes that they don't know
Oh, they talk shit though
[Chorus]
I don't want no lunchbox friends, no
I want someone who understands, oh, no
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no
No lunchbox friends, no, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no
[Post-Chorus]
No lunchbox friends, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever
[Verse 2]
They want a fat ass in their brand-new jeans
Want a baby in the back with the man of their dreams
That isn't the life for me
Gotta look like a fuckin' damn Barbie
Goin' on TV, people have high expectations of me
Wanna be my best friend, then judge me if I smoke a little weed
Makes no fuckin' sense to me
[Pre-Chorus]
The hassle, the fightin', they all want a bite of me
Photos, more photos
Then gossip 'bout hoes that they don't know
Oh, they talk shit though
[Chorus]
I don't want no lunchbox friends, no
I want someone who understands, oh, no
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no
No lunchbox friends, no, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no
[Post-Chorus]
No, no, no, no
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever
No lunchbox friends, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever, no
No, no, no, no
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever
[Outro]
No lunchbox friends, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever
