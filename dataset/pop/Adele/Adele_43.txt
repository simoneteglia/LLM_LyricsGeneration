[Verse 1]
Oh, oh‚ stick it down your throat
I'm watchin' from the bathroom makin' sure I don't
Choke‚ choke from the words you spoke
When you're screamin' at the mirror (Screamin' at the mirror)
Now you're sittin' in the cafeteria
Shovin' clementines and orange bacteria
Down your throat a dozen times or near‚ yeah
Fooling those around of your bulimia
[Chorus]
You turn oranges to orange juice
Enter there, then spit it out of you
Your body is imperfectly perfect
Everyone wants what the other one's workin'
No orange juice
[Post-Chorus]
Ee, ah‚ ee, ah, OJ
Ee‚ ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I believe you chose
To blow it on the reading carpet
That's what happens when you stuff it
Please say that you won't continue
Ordering oranges off the menu
Stuffin' up your mouth with t-t-tissue
The way you look is not an issue
[Chorus]
You turn oranges to orange juice
Enter there, then spit it out of you
Your body is imperfectly perfect
Everyone wants what the other one's workin'
No orange juice
[Post-Chorus]
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
[Bridge]
Ooh, I wish I could give you my set of eyes
'Cause I know your eyes ain't workin', mmm
I wish I could tell you that you're fine, so fine
But you will find that disconcertin'
[Chorus]
You turn oranges to orange juice
Enter there, then spit it out of you
Your body is imperfectly perfect
Everyone wants what the other one's workin'
No orange juice
[Post-Chorus]
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
[Outro]
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
Ee, ah, ee, ah, OJ
