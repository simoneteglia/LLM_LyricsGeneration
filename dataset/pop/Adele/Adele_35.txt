[Verse 1]
Feeling unsure of my naked body
Stand back, watch it taking shape
Wondering why I don't look like Barbie
They say boys like girls with a tiny waist
Now, my mama's preaching to make sure I'm pure
But, I never really cared 'bout this shit before
Look around the room to whoever wants me
[Pre-Chorus]
Got boys acting like they ain't seen skin before
Got sent home to change 'cause my skirt is too short
[Chorus]
It's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one told them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
[Verse 2]
Gotta make sure that my legs are shiny
Hot wax melting, burn my skin
People all around me are watching closely
'Cause it's how I look and not what I think
[Pre-Chorus]
Mikey's eyes seem to be glued to her chest
So, I'm stuffing my bra so that mine look the best
[Chorus]
It's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one told them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
[Bridge]
Instead of making me feel bad for the body I got
Just teach him to keep it in his pants and tell him to stop
[Chorus]
Sayin' it's my fault, it's my fault 'cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad, no one told them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
