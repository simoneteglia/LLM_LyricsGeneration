[Verse 1]
Everyone's so soft, everyone's so sensitive
Do I offend you? You're hanging on my sentences
You can keep your costume and you can keep your mask
I'ma take a bow so you can kiss my ass
[Chorus]
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama club
[Verse 2]
They try to feed you lines that you have to memorize
You always hide behind your Wizard of Oz disguise
Do you even have a brain?
You're sticking to a page
You're faking all your pain, yeah, you're bleeding on a stage
[Chorus]
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama club (Ooh)
I never signed up for your drama club (Ooh)
For your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna be an actress, living by a script
Who cares about practice? Hmm, I don't give a shit
You're over-analyzing every word I say
There's a whole world out there, you're living a play
Fuck your auditorium, I think it's pretty boring and
[Chorus]
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama
Up for your drama club (Ooh)
I never signed up for your drama club (Ooh)
For your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
[Bridge]
For your drama club
Mmm, mmm
[Chorus]
I never signed up (Ooh), mmm, mmm
I never signed up (Ooh), never signed up
Never signed up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh), for your drama
For your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
I never signed up for your drama (Ooh)
Up for your drama, up for your drama club
