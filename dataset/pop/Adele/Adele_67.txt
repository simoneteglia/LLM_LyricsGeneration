[Verse 1]
You're driving me away, give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you, but not in this way
Don’t think you quite understand who you have on your hands
How can you not see just how good for you I am?
I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in ’cause I only want to be the cure
If you don't choose to grow, we ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere
[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man likе you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to givе for free and it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me
[Verse 2]
All you do is complain about decisions you make
How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place, but you will never give it up
It's where they make you feel powerful
That’s why you think I make you feel small
But that’s your projection, it's not my rejection
I put my heart on the line for the very first time
Because you asked me to and now you’ve gone and changed your mind
But lovin' you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get the love I had for you
'Cause you don't care, oh
[Chorus]
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain’t never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free and it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me
[Outro]
A woman like me (One more time)
Complacency (Woman like me), is the worst trait to have (Woman like me)
Are you crazy? (Woman like me)
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me (Woman like me)
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy (Woman like me)
Consistency (Woman like me), is the gift to give for free and it is key
