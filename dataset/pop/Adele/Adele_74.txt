[Verse 1]
Falling asleep by the arcade
Liquor it jumps off your tongue
You used all your words for a quick game
Blew it all before you won
I speak in cursive, I'm poignant, assertive
There's musical chairs in my teeth
Poke me to battle, I'll jump on the saddle
I'll smile as you fall to your feet
[Pre-Chorus]
And they talk without thinkin'
They bark while they're shakin'
With teeth that are round and dull
And they yell while they're chasin'
While I'm steady-pacin'
My syllables hit the floor
[Chorus]
How stupid, selfish baby
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
I'll wreck you if you chase me
But I'll be silent 'til you cross the line
The line, the line
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
So crude and selfish baby
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
[Verse 2]
Call all your guys in the dive bar
They'll give you the validation
Your daddy could never bestow you
While bloody, they'll tell you you've won
[Pre-Chorus]
And they talk without thinkin'
They bark while they're shakin'
With teeth that are round and dull
And they yell while they're chasin'
While I'm steady-pacin'
My syllables hit the floor
[Chorus]
How stupid, selfish baby
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
I'll wreck you if you chase me
But I'll be silent 'til you cross the line
The line, the line
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
So crude and selfish baby
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
And they talk without thinkin'
They bark while they're shakin'
With teeth that are round and dull
And they yell while they're chasin'
While I'm steady-pacin'
My syllables hit the floor
[Chorus]
How stupid, selfish baby
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
I'll wreck you if you chase me
But I'll be silent 'til you cross the line
The line, the line
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
So crude and selfish baby
Don't you battle with my larynx tonight
[Instrumental Outro]
