[Intro: Mic Righteous]
Drink, Lucas!
[Chorus: ZAYN]
I ain't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice, yeah, we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell me, yeah, I ain't livin' right
[Post-Chorus: ZAYN &
Mic Righteous
]
Let my mama tell me, yeah
Yeah, let my mama tell me, yeah
Let my mama tell me, yeah
Yeah, let my mama tell me, yeah
(Drink, Lucas!)
[Verse: Mic Righteous]
Alright, I got Bonnie Rotten on my left, Dot Cotton on my right
You ain't gotta tell me which one I should fuck
I know what's wrong, I know what's right
Pick a politician, hang him from his tie
Throw a party after, we'll all watch him die
The police can arrive, I will not comply
Wild beast for life and I'm legally blind
Blind to the laws, the rules
Society pulls the wool over our eyes
I am not confined to the floors and walls
I am not normal, I do not ball
But I got a female who replies to my emails, so I ain't got a type
Not with these nails, have you seen 'em? Tell 'em don't waste my time, I'm the cleanest
I don't need a Snapchat to prove I have a life
Who gives a fuck about a dress when there's death in Palestine?
No pretty gold or blue, it's just black and it's white
And it proves dependent on reflection of light
Your perception becomes deception for the mind
That's why I judge no colour, creed or size
(Drink, Lucas!)
I'll fuck any girl 'cause I ain't got a type
Fuck every girl 'cause I ain't got a type
You just on the hype, you shit on the mic
When I'm on the mic, I still pedal by on a pedal bike
Never slow down, never sell mine
You be set alight, tell me when I've ever said a lie
Will they ever understand what happens in this state of mind?
Damn, man, newcomer fuckin' with your own girl
Oh well, they don't know I plan to fuck the whole world
Whole world, ZAYN's payin' for the whole hotel
And wholesale L-O-L, like "lol", bro
Only check the price at the till though, YOLO
Is you trill though? Little dildo
What's the deal though? Got an album comin' with no deal though
Do what you can, I'll do what I will, bro
I'll fuck any girl that isn't on the pill, yo
[Chorus: ZAYN &
Mic Righteous
]
I ain't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice, yeah, we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell me, yeah, I ain't livin' right
[Post-Chorus: ZAYN]
Let my mama tell me, yeah
Yeah let my mama tell me, yeah
Let my mama tell me, yeah
Yeah let my mama tell me, yeah
