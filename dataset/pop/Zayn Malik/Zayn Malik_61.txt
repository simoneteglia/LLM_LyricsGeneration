[Intro]
Think I'm from space
My soul fell down
I found the Earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And ain't no place now, if I got you
[Verse 1]
Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere you go
Anywhere you go
Round the universe
I'll be there, I'll be there
Wherever you go, wherever you go, babe
[Chorus]
Think I'm from space
My soul fell down
I found the Earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And it's my place now, if I got you
If I got you, baby
You, baby
You, baby
[Verse 2]
I don't care, I don't care
Wherever you been
'Cause now you're with me
Floating through the night
Feels like we're dancing
Is this the feeling
The feeling of falling in love?
'Cause I know that we met before, babe
[Chorus]
Think I'm from space
My soul fell down
I found the earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And it's my place now, if I got you
If I got you, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You, baby
Think I'm from space
My soul fell down
I found the earth
Not leaving now
I know your face
Think you fell too
And it's my place now, if I got you
If I got you, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You, baby
You, baby
