[Intro]
('Cause we are who we are when no one’s watchin'
And right from the start, you know I got you
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine)
[Verse 1]
Don't look around 'cause love is blind
And, darlin', right now I can't see you
I’m feelin' proud so without a doubt
I can feel you
[Chorus]
'Cause we are who we are when no one’s watchin'
And right from the start, you know I got you
Yeah, you know I got you
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine
[Verse 2]
We messed around
Until we found the one thing
We said we could never ever
If we died, I’m not allowed to talk about it
But I gotta tell you
[Chorus]
'Cause we are who we are when no one’s watchin'
And right from the start, you know I got you
Yeah, you know I got you
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine
