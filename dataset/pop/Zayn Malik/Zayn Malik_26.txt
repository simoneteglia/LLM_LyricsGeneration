[Intro]
I'm unfuckwithable
In a world of my own
That’s why my shoulder's so cold
I'm unfuckwithable
[Verse 1]
So tired of fake friends and fake love, you know
No time for no lie and I’m here to show
I found a way higher
Me is all I need to be inspired
My vibe and my life are all my design
Your sentiment's irrelevant
'Cause I get down and up again
'Cause I had the time of my life
[Chorus]
I'm just unfuckwithable
In a world of my own
That's why my shoulder's so cold
I'm unfuckwithable
[Bridge]
Can’t nobody take me home
Yeah, I’m worth my weight in gold
Forget whatever you've been told
I am unfuckwithable, unfuckwithable
[Verse 2]
They all said I wouldn’t do shit
Now they all about my new shit
Thinkin' we were always cool when
I was never even all on your mind
Happens all the time
You probably thought
I couldn't turn water to wine
Water to wine, happens all the time
[Chorus]
I'm unfuckwithable
In a world of my own
That’s why my shoulder's so cold
I'm unfuckwithable
