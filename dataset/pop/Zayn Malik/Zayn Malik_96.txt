Like a shameless flower cries at every wedding
You don't have feelings, you just have petals
There is no meaning, it's just aesthetics
Then to ask me, I'd say pathetic is the only one that fits
And wins inside a world of acronyms
Twisted shapes of acrobats
Inside a mesh of flesh and bone
Is an underlying desperate tone
To the world of real authentic
The iPhone likes preventing
This place of role play, I think we like pretending
As if our fun is never ending
No one speaks, just message sending
It's a silent planet - Wait. It's pending
