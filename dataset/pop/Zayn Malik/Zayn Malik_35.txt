[Verse 1]
Funny when you come to mind
That's when you hit me up
That's when we feel a little closer
Just when I started thinkin'
It's like a force we can't explain
Work like a magnet, babe
I thought of you in the next moment
Givin' me that feelin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Could be my suspicion
Maybe I'm just out here overthinkin' (Thinkin'), oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Like you come into the picture
When I start to feel like something's missin' (Missin'), oh, oh-ooh
[Chorus]
I don't wanna miss out on another love
So I'm gonna dive right in
Go head first into the unknown (The unknown, the unknown)
Like it's all I know (Like it's all I know)
Baby, could you keep it up?
Don't wanna stop at words, ain't еnough
Feels just like a drug
It really fuck me up
[Post-Chorus]
Call it (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
A digital (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
But physical (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Connеction (Yeah, yeah)
Call it (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
A digital (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
But physical (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Connection
[Verse 2]
Love you every single night
That's when I feel your love
That's when I take your clothes off
Can we stay in the bedroom?
'Cause you're always on my brain
I can't get away
Leavin' for you next mornin'
Give into the feelin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Could be my suspicion
Maybe I'm just out here overthinkin' (Thinkin'), oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Like you come into the picture
When I start to feel like something's missin' (Missin'), oh, oh-ooh
[Chorus]
I don't wanna miss out on another love
So I'm gonna dive right in
Go head first into the unknown (The unknown, the unknown)
Like it's all I know (Like it's all I know)
Baby, could you keep it up?
Don't wanna stop and words ain't enough
Feels just like a drug (Drug, drug)
It really fuck me up (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus]
Call it (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
A digital (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
But physical (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Connection (Yeah, yeah)
Call it (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
A digital (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
But physical (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Connection
