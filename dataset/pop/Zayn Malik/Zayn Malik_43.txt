[Verse 1]
Just let me talk, you know what I'm sayin’
Don't give me that, girl I know you're stayin’
Where you goin'? You feel that space, it's mine
Said we're goin', in every space and time
[Pre-Chorus]
But love me tonight
Speak all your mind
Take all your time
I know that you're mine (I know that you're mine)
[Chorus]
So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there’s no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow’s
Never gonna come
So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there’s no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come
[Verse 2]
Tell me why it's always different in the mornin'
Last night you were by my side
Space and time, I wanna fall into your eyes
There’s no point in stallin', there's nothin' to hide
Right now it's priceless, some things you can't buy
You're that protection that keeps me alive
Oh you got it right, you got it right
[Pre-Chorus]
But love me tonight
Speak all your mind
Take all your time
I know that you're mine (I know that you're mine)
[Chorus]
So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come
[Bridge]
No matter where you are
Or where you'll be
When you're feelin' yourself
I know you're thinkin' of me
[Pre-Chorus]
But love me tonight
Speak all your mind
Take all your time
I know that you're mine (I know that you're mine)
[Chorus]
So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come
So love me
Like we don't have tomorrow (Like we don't, like we don't have tomorrow)
Like there's no time at all, love
Love me like tomorrow's
Never gonna come
