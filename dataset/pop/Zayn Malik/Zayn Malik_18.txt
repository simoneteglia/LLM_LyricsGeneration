[Intro]
We're so late nights, red eyes
Amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes
Amnesia, I need ya
[Verse 1]
Right now, I can't see straight
Intoxicated, it's true, when I'm with you
I'm buzzin' and I feel laced
I'm coming from a different phase when I'm with you
[Pre-Chorus]
Another way now, like we're supposed to do (Ooh)
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you (Ooh)
Wasted every night, gone for every song
Faded every night, dancin' all night long
[Chorus]
Drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah)
Drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah)
We've been drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Drinkin' and flowin' and rollin', we're falling down
[Post-Chorus]
We're so late nights, red eyes
Amnesia, I need ya
[Verse 2]
Right now, I'm emotional
I lose control when I'm with you
I hope I haven't said too much
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you
[Pre-Chorus]
Another way now, like we're supposed to do (Ooh)
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you (Ooh)
Wasted every night, gone for every song
Faded every night, dancin' all night long (Fakin' all night long)
[Chorus]
Drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah)
Drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah; No, love)
We've been drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah, yeah; Oh, woah)
Drinkin' and flowin' and rollin', we're falling down (Don't go)
[Post-Chorus]
We're so late nights, red eyes (Red eyes)
Amnesia, on ice
Late nights (Baby), red eyes
Amnesia, I need ya (I need you, baby)
[Outro]
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk (
You put your drinks up
; Don't go)
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk (Ah)
Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer
It's goin' around, yeah
