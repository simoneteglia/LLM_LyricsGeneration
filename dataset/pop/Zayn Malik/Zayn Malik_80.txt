My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined
But, after
five years,
I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band
I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart
I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight
I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall
I know they will continue to be the best band in the world
