[Verse 1]
We can leave an imprint
'Cause this minute that I'm in
'Cause this minute's where I live with you
Where I stay with you
If you wanna stay up late
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl we'd still make it
If the planets all faded away
You might think I'm crazy
But I know you're my baby anyway
[Chorus]
Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
[Verse 2]
You can take it all off
'Cause this love ain't got no cost
No excuses I'll be cursed for you
It's just something that I say to you
If you want it I can change
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl we'd still make it
If the planets all faded away
You might think I'm crazy
But I know you're my baby anyway
[Chorus]
Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
[Verse 3]
I never told you the story, oh
They say this building's from Victorian times
I guess we all got a story, oh
Just tellin' mine
Change the scenario
Jumpin' like Mario
Gotta give it all a go
Don't lose a life
[Chorus]
Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
Girl you took two minutes out of my life
Yeah who told ya I ain't with it? I need ya
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
I don't want 'em back
I just want you back in my bed
