[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
What if I changed my mind?
What if I said it's over?
I been flying so long
Can't remember what it was like to be sober
What if I lost my lives?
What if I said game over?
What if I forget my lines
And I lose all my composure?
[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
[Chorus]
I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
[Verse 2]
What if we never met?
What if I never saw her?
'Cause I've been burning up for so long
In a world that just keeps getting colder
[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
[Chorus]
I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
[Bridge]
Nobody does this like you
I've been around the world
I seen a lot of girls
I been a lot of places
I seen a lot of faces
Nobody does this like you
[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
I know she'll bring me back to life
