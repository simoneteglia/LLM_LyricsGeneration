[Verse 1: ZAYN]
You always say I only call you after midnight
You're who I want, end of the day (Oh)
Those pics you sent me, down there speedin' through these red lights
Don't get too comfortable, babe (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
I'm on my way
I'm sorry I made you wait
I hope that you stay awake
Do you love me anyway?
Look, I know I'm wrong
But I'm too good to be alone
I promise it won't be long
Do you love me anyway?
[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know it's late
But I'm coming over 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin' so it counts as tonight
I know it's late
But I'm coming over 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin' so it counts as tonight
[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm coming over 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin' so it counts as tonight
[Verse 2: ZAYN]
Don't get undressed yet, baby, I want to undress you
Hold up girl, I'm right down the street (Oh)
Only a couple minutes 'til I come and check you
Then I'm gon' put you half asleep (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
Hm, I'm on my way
I'm sorry I made you wait
I hope that you stay awake
Do you love me anyway?
Look, I know I'm wrong
But I'm too good to be alone
I promise it won't be long
Do you love me anyway?
[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, I know it's late
But I'm coming over 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin' so it counts as tonight
I know it's late
But I'm coming over 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin' so it counts as tonight
[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm coming over 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin' so it counts as tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm coming over 'til 2, 3, 4 in the mornin' so it counts as tonight
Oh
