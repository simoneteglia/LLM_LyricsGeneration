[Verse 1]
Rainberry, please
You think I'm on my knees, but don't you worry
I know what you don't know-oh-oh
Don't even start, the truth won't break my heart
No, don't you worry
I already know-oh-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Too many bones inside your closet
You thought you buried deep
But they never let me get a minute of peace
How do you sleep? Ooh
[Chorus]
Rainberry
Falling down your blood-red lips
Why are your eyes heavy?
Is there somebody else you missed?
Tell me what's going on before I go too far
Said, Rainberry
Is there somebody else, somebody else now?
[Verse 2]
Dry your eyes 'cause it won't work this time
I already dried mine, and I won't drown in yours
Go wash your hands, but you can't change your past
Those stories ain't shit now
You don't mean it, I'm sure
[Pre-Chorus]
Too many bones inside your closet
You thought you buried deep
But they never let me get a minute of peace
How do you sleep? Ooh
[Chorus]
Rainberry
Falling down your blood-red lips
Why are your eyes heavy?
Is there somebody else you missed?
Tell me what's going on before I go too far
Said, Rainberry
Is there somebody else, somebody else now?
[Bridge]
Rainberry, please
Rainberry
Rainberry, please
[Pre-Chorus]
Too many bones inside your closet
You thought you buried deep
But they never let me get a minute of peace
How do you sleep? Ooh
[Chorus]
Rainberry
Falling down your blood-red lips
Why are your eyes heavy?
Is there somebody else you missed?
Tell me what's going on before I go too far
Said, Rainberry
Is there somebody else, somebody else now?
