[Chorus]
I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
There's no goodbyes, only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow
[Verse 1]
I been feeling high when I touch your body
That's how I feel the soul inside her body
Can't believe my eyes I swear
You glow, I follow you close
Fingertips touch, all I want your body
Fingertips touch all I want
[Pre-Chorus]
All I want
All I ever wanted
It's in front of me
Right in front of me
What have I done
Now I never done
This could be the end of me
Be the end of me
[Chorus]
I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
There's no goodbyes, only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow
[Verse 2]
I been feeling like I deserve somebody
And you burn so bright you can blind somebody
You go following flights to the stars
And these cars can get us home
[Pre-Chorus]
All I want
All I ever wanted
It's in front of me
Right in front of me
What have I done?
Now I never done
This could be the end of me
Be the end of me
[Chorus]
I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
There's no goodbyes, only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow
[Bridge]
As long as you feeling the same, ah
I'll follow you into the flames, ah
As long as you feeling the same, ah
I'll follow you into the flames, ah
[Chorus]
I go where you go
Go through Armageddon
Girl I got you
There's no goodbyes, only us
So I will follow
Hold you close standing on the edge of no tomorrow
Still deep in us, get that rush
So I still follow
