[Verse 1]
It's just like breathin', speakin'
When we touch, like a force of nature
Not just a feelin', let's believe it
The birth of love like a force of nature
[Pre-Chorus]
Undeniable (It's our love)
Unforgettable (It's our love)
Nothing compares to when
I feel you on my skin
[Chorus]
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
[Post-Chorus]
When we come together, together, together
When we come together, together, together
[Verse 2]
Pure heart, deeper
Beautiful, like the bluest ocean
Like a wave, we broke down
The barriers, like the bluest ocean
[Pre-Chorus]
It's incredible (It's our love)
Unforgettable (It's our love)
Nothing compares to when
I feel you on my skin
[Chorus]
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
[Post-Chorus]
When we come together, together, together
When we come together, together, together
[Bridge]
Like a hurricane (It's our love)
Like a hurricane (It's our love)
Like a hurricane
When we come together
Like a hurricane (It's our love)
Like a hurricane (It's our love)
Like a hurricane
When we come together
[Chorus]
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
It feels so natural, natural
When we come together
Like a force of nature
[Post-Chorus]
Let's come together, come together
Right now, right now
Let's come together, come together
Right now, right now
Come together, together
Right now
