I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink oh love
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can live in love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18…
