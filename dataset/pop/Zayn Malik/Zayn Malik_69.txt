[Refrain]
Your lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor it
[Verse 1]
Probably you're bad for me
When I take it in
It's like air to me, can't stop breathing
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep it burning, it's your turn
I want you, I want you right now
You're my dream, my nicotine, I want you
I need you just like
[Chorus]
Cigarettes
Oh, baby, like cigarettes
We'll all be forgetting, quit your regret like cigarettes
Cigarettes
Disappear like cigarettes
We'll be so short of breath
Our hearts still on edge like cigarettes
[Refrain]
Your lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor it
[Verse 2]
In my bloodstream, one more hit
Clouded in your loving
But I follow it
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep it burning, it's your turn
I want you, I want you right now
You're my dream, my nicotine, I want you
I need you just like
[Chorus]
Cigarettes
Oh, baby, like cigarettes
We'll all be forgetting, quit your regret like cigarettes
Cigarettes
Disappear like cigarettes
We'll be so short of breath
Our hearts still on edge like cigarettes
[Refrain]
Your lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor it
[Bridge]
Searching here, my love, that's all I need
Searching here, my love
Searching here, my love, that's all I need
Searching here, my love (My love)
But you don't respond to me like
[Chorus]
Cigarettes
Oh, baby, like cigarettes
We'll all be forgetting, quit your regret like cigarettes
Cigarettes
Disappear like cigarettes
We'll be so short of breath
Our hearts still on edge like cigarettes
[Refrain]
Your lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor it
