[Verse 1]
When you're standing in the dark
And you struggle to find the light
When you just try to find your way
But you just can't find the time
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll come for you
You know that I'll save you
[Chorus]
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
[Post-Chorus]
When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone
[Verse 2]
When the water's just too deep
Getting chased by the shark
When the pressure's just too much
And you feel it in your heart
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll come for you
You know that I'll save you
[Chorus]
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
[Post-Chorus]
(Need somebody)
When you need somebody
(Need somebody)
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone
[Bridge]
And who's right? Let me know
I'll be there, I'll be close
It's your fear, let me know
If this dies, be my ghost
[Chorus]
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
[Post-Chorus]
When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone
