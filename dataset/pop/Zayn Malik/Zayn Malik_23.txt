[Verse 1]
Can your heart be mine
In search?
'Cause I have no time
To help you find all the words
Melodies and memories
Stories that sound absurd
I will tell no lies
[Pre-Chorus]
As long as you look
Me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind (Oh)
[Chorus]
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began (Oh)
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend
[Verse 2]
Please don't wait
I'm not coming home tonight
I wanna love you
But I can't (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
As long as you look (Ah)
Me in the eyes (Ah)
I'll go wherever you are (Ah)
I'll follow behind (Behind, oh)
[Chorus]
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in (Ah)
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began (Oh)
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again (Ah)
Heard about all that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend
[Bridge]
I never doubted myself
But I doubted you
I'm tired of looking at myself
In my rear view (Oh)
[Chorus]
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in (Ah)
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began (Oh)
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again (Ah)
Heard about all that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend
