[Intro]
The goal
If you want to use this terminology like that
The goal is, uh, is missed
The goal is yourself without a goal
[Verse 1]
'Bout to hit you with some shit that these motherfuckers don't know
Said, "fuck it" to the promo, I ain't sinking Titanic
Bitch, I built this whole boat, this is no joke
'Bout to hit the guards, what these motherfuckers don't know
Yo, chill out, get the spliff out
Caught me with my dick out
I'm about to spit some shit now
Put this on the list, I'm about to write the script
While I'm floating you're a blip
Man, I call this song a diss
You're among the best I am uncontest, not impressed, guest
On your song bigger than you can
Pull the trigger, gun, James Bond
I been moving like I'vе done
Now you seem pulling cons like a pro
Said they couldn't see it now you know
I'vе been focused on the crap since it broke
Put these rappers on a chokehold
Going corner till they broke toes
You're a goner, bro, we both know, these are my goals
At the end, like dry combs, we ain't friends, homes
You could never call my ends home
The bad bones, I ain't John Doe
Double meanings, like it's J cole
Sick and tired of the same old in my feelings, I'mma let go
Feels like a season 'till we get old
See you reachin on the debt, though
Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp flow
Silly wanker, Imma vet so
Be quiet, papa said so
Call me "Zaddy" on my dad flow
Nice silent, why you mad though, like a bad joke
It don't land like my grandad when he came from Pakistan
On foreign land don't understand
My simple plan was not to stand for the simple man
I'm complex, unlike my sex
And what's the chance that axes and spinning
Are part of the plan since beginning
Got asked these thoughts, your brain spinning
You thought sinning was something else
Can't help yourself like Santa's elf
My mental health reaching God level
I don't mean I'm a God
But 47 and 11 greets me on all levels
Yellow metal trynna tell you something it's not settled
This old kettle reachin' boiling point
Contribute your voice
Tonight chop it off and cauterise
Heard your noise, implore the effort
Your fans deserve the credit, surely deafened
Ain't even a close second on in all seconds
I'm a force to be reckoned with
And I don't even give a shit
Have you learned your lesson? Class in session is no test
And we ain’t testing them, you’re stuck with no progression
Assessin 'em, obsessing over nothin'
I see 'em clowning like Krusty, no rust
Imma steal, I'm finessing in a slow sesh
This sauceless [?], hopeless
And get your feelings hurt less
In a deep sea like Loch Ness
Remoteness but I control it, I'm on my own
That's why it's my own world
Montana, put a hole in the ground for the tub
My man is Chaka Khan, beat it up
Me and Dan put a spanner in the works
[Outro]
All you needed was a vibe
But Imma give you more than what you need
All you needed was a vibe
But Imma give you more than what you need
All you needed was a vibe
But Imma give you more than what you need
Imma give you more than what you need
