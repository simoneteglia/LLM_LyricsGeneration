[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, are you too?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
[Build: Sia]
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
[Drop: ZAYN & Sia]
But you'll never be alone
[Verse 2: ZAYN]
We were shut like a jacket
So do your zip
We would roll down the rapids
To find a wave that fits
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
[Refrain: Sia & ZAYN]
'Cause I wanna touch you, baby
I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sun rise on your sins
Just me and you
[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
[Chorus: ZAYN & Sia,
Sia
]
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
(
Oh
)
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
[Build: Sia]
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
[Drop: ZAYN & Sia,
Sia

But you'll never be alone
(
Baby, I'm right here
