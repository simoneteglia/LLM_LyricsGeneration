[Verse 1]
She puts her spirit in a nightcap
She always knows where the crowd's at
She puts her mouth 'round the cigarette
I put it out 'cause she likes that
She always dance when it's rainin'
Hey, when's it startin', baby?
She looks at me like she's waitin'
Makin' time go slow when they show her the table
[Pre-Chorus]
Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy
[Chorus]
She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
[Verse 2]
She's cryin' out that she loves me
Holdin' my hands so I won't leave
'Cause baby don't wanna be lonely
She says, "I just want you to hold me"
[Pre-Chorus]
Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy
[Chorus]
She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
[Post-Chorus]
In the right way
In the right way
[Bridge]
In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way, in the right way (Yeah)
In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way, in the right way
In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way, in the right way (Right way)
In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way
[Chorus]
She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way (Right way)
She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
