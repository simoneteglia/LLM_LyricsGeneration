[Intro: All]
Zayn Malik, you're breaking my heart
You've left Louis, Liam, Niall, and Harry
[Verse: Connor,
Bradley
,
Tristan
,
James
]
You did the high notes
You were my favorite
Your hair was sexy
I loved it
But then you left us
Like a naughty boy
Now my whole world's void of any kind of joy
I think I'm gonna need a tissue
Now I've got everything except you
Moved on from the band, I'm so confused
Who's gonna do the singing on "It's Gotta Be You?"
[Pre-Chorus: Tristan,
James
,
Connor
,
Bradley
]
I turn the radio up, and it's just my luck
Why-y-y-y did you leave?
I turn my laptop on, One Direction look wrong
Why would you do this to me?
It just feels so out of place
To not see your nice face
(
Hahaha
)
Now everybody knows you won't be at their shows
Instead you'll be kissing Perrie, yeah
[Chorus: All,
Tristan
]
Zayn Malik, you're breaking my heart
You've left Louis, Liam, Niall, and Harry
Oh Zayn Malik, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come back (
Back
)
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh-eh-eh
[Bridge: Connor,
Bradley
,
Tristan
,
James
, *All*]
I know you've had a stressful time and want normality
But that leaked track that was online really excited me
Oh please, oh please promise me
We'll get a solo CD
So you can finally
*Come back to, come back to me*
[Chorus: All]
Zayn Malik, you're breaking my heart
You've left Louis, Liam, Niall, and Harry
Oh Zayn Malik, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come back
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh, eh-eh-eh-eh
