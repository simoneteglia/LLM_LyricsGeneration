[Intro]
Border
Border
Border
Border, ayy
[Verse 1]
She is the life of the party (
Border
)
Don't stick that knife in my body (
Border, border, ayy
)
It's somethin' she always wanted (
Border
)
It's for a good cause, you're doin' a good job (
Border, border
)
[Pre-Chorus]
And we're off where the wind blows
I don't care where we go
Just like the ocean, you change what I see
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion, all because of me
[Chorus]
So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
You were right on the border (
Border
)
Give me all of this, give me all of you (
Border, border
)
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (
Border, border, ayy
)
[Verse 2]
Beautiful insanity (
Border, border
)
You're like a movie, change the scene (
Border, border, ayy
)
Taste your sweet profanity (
Border, border
)
It's all for a good cause, think you're doin' a good job (
Border, border, ayy
)
[Pre-Chorus]
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion, all because of me
[Chorus]
So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
You were right on the border
Give me all of this, give me all of you
No fallin' in, don't need no proof
You were right on border
[Bridge]
Give me all of this, give me all of you
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (
Border
)
Give me all of this, give me all of you (
Border, border
)
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (
Border
)
[Chorus]
So take it off, let's break down all of our walls
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost
Right now, I wanna see it all, oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
You were right on the border
Give me all of this, give me all of you (
Border, border
)
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (
Border
)
You were right on the border
Give me all of this, give me all of you (
Border, border
)
No fallin' in, don't need no proof (
Border
)
You were right on the border
