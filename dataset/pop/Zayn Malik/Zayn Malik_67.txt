[Verse 1]
You say you're doing fine now (But I could tell, I could tell)
It still lies in your smile
You know just what to say to make me stay, make me stay
While your twisting the blame
[Chorus]
You know me the best but you hurt, hurt hurt
Hurt me the worst
You know me the best but you hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the worst
You know me the best but you hurt
Every single thing you know about me
Is every single thing you use to only hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the worst
'Cause you know me the best
You hurt me the worst
[Verse 2]
I know I should let go now (But I know, but I know)
No one else feels like home, yeah
You know just what to say to make me stay, make me stay
One more dose of the pain
[Chorus]
You know me the best but you hurt, hurt hurt
Hurt me the worst
You know me the best but you hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the worst
You know me the best but you hurt
Every single thing you know about me
Is every single thing you use to only hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the worst
'Cause you know me the best
You hurt me the worst
[Bridge]
You know just what to do to make me want something new
But I run back to you
[Chorus]
You know me the best but you hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the worst
You know me the best but you hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the worst
You know me the best but you hurt
Every single thing you know about me
Is every single thing you use to only hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt me the worst
'Cause you know me the best
You hurt me the worst
'Cause you know me the best
You hurt me the worst
