[Verse 1]
My luck's on the game, can't find a way through
Don't know how many times I had to say this to you
This ain't my scene, this weren't my dream
It was all yours, of course
I got caught up in this game
And you know I won't say names of who's to blame
[Pre-Chorus]
I won't point any fingers, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time and, in time, you'll see the truth
I won't ask any questions, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time and, in time, you'll see the truth
[Chorus]
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
[Verse 2]
My own mind was in the way, front seat, new view
Don't know how many times I've had to talk you through
My dreams, new scenes with enemies
I got caught up in this game again
[Pre-Chorus]
I won't point any fingers, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take it's time and, in time, you'll see the truth
[Chorus]
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
[Bridge]
I tried, hide it all
Don't try, don't try
Don't try to hide it all
Don't try to hide it all (Don't)
Don't try, don't try (Don't, don't)
Don't try to hide it all (Don't, don't)
[Pre-Chorus]
I won't point any fingers, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take it's time and, in time, you'll see the truth
[Chorus]
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
