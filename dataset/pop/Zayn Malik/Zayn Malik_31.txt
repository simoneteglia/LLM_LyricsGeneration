[Verse 1]
Walks in the place, hands on her waist
Gun on her thigh, big shooter game
She did this before, murdered to gain
Promised her ma she won't kill again
[Pre-Chorus]
She got it and she know she got it
I'm takin' off like a rocket
Spaceship so high, I can't stop it
Like sour diesel
I can't stop the feelin'
Can't stop your feet, no
Feels like I'm dreamin'
Didn't feel it seep in
She burn, she burn, she burn
[Chorus]
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin' (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Can't stop your feet, no
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
She burn, she burn, she burn
Like sour diesel
[Verse 2]
Lips on her face, back in the place
Legs in the air, all dirty again
Smokin' some more, I'm in her space
She touches me there, then I do it again
[Pre-Chorus]
She got it and she know she got it
I'm takin' off like a rocket
Spaceship so high, I can't stop it
[Chorus]
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin', no (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Can't stop your feet, no
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
She burn, she burn, she burn
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Feels like the heat, yeah
When the flame is here (She burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the heat, yeah
Can't stop the feet (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel
Can't stop the feelin', oh (She burn, she burn, she burn)
No, I can't stop
[Bridge]
'Cause it's burnin' all around you
I'm so glad I found you
'Cause it's burnin' all around you
I'm so glad I found you
Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
[Chorus]
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel, like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Ooh, yeah, she burn, she burn (She burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin' (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Yeah, sour diesel, wow (She burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour diesel (She burn, she burn, she burn)
She burn (She burn, she burn, she burn)
She burn
