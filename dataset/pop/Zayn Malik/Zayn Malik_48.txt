[Verse 1]
Blurry TV screens
Fuzzy broken scenes
Finding words don't have flow
Blurry TV screens
Fuzzy broken scenes
Hold her close finding love
[Pre-Chorus]
Hearts don't feel the same
And the names we like to say
Change with time and age
[Chorus]
So I
I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you are or aren't with it
I know what I need
'Cause I
I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you are or aren't with it
I know what I need
[Pre-Chorus]
Hearts don't feel the same
And the names we like to say
Change with time and age
[Chorus]
So I
I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you are or aren't with it
I know what I need
'Cause I
I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you are or aren't with it
I know what I need
[Bridge]
You still remember my eyes
Even if the
Men In Black
flashed their light into your eyes
For the second time this night
It feels right, then it's only you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
Oh, you and I
[Chorus]
So I
I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you are or aren't with it
I know what I need
'Cause I
I don't wanna say what's scripted
Whether you are or aren't with it
I know what I need
