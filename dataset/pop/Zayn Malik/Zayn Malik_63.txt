[Intro]
You could be a changed man if you wanted
You could make the doves cry if you wanted
Tell me that you want that, but you don't
Tell me that you want that, but you don't
[Verse 1]
I say I'm sorry, but you're never sober
I start drinking, it's too much thinking, oh
It's the same every time that you're with me
[Chorus]
I think I need some fresh air (Fresh air, fresh air)
Feeling under pressure (Pressure, pressure)
Don't wanna talk about it ('Bout it, 'bout it)
Don't even get me started over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you
[Post-Chorus]
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you on some different shit?
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you on some different shit?
[Verse 2]
We're caught in a cycle, so pardon my psycho
We could've been right, though, guess that's how life go
There's nothing that I can do for you
[Chorus]
I think I need some fresh air (Fresh air, fresh air)
Feeling under pressure (Pressure, pressure)
Don't wanna talk about it ('Bout it, 'bout it)
Don't even get me started over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you
I think I need some fresh air (Fresh air, fresh air)
Feeling under pressure (Pressure, pressure)
Don't wanna talk about it ('Bout it, 'bout it)
Don't even get me started over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you
[Post-Chorus]
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you on some different shit?
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you on some different shit?
Why you on some different shit?
[Outro]
You could be a changed man if you wanted
You could make the doves cry if you wanted
Tell me that you want that, but you don't
Tell me that you want that, but you don't
(You and me got differences)
