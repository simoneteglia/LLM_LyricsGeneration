[Verse 1]
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling...
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
For I can't help falling...
[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
[Verse 2]
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
[Verse 3]
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
[Outro]
I've been falling for you, baby
I, I can' help falling
I just can't help falling in love
I, I can' help falling
I just can't help falling in love
I just can't help falling in love
