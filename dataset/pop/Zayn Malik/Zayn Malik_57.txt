[Verse 1]
Girl I got a problem
Unless we trust
You could be the best friend
Or you could be the one
But girl I got a problem
Unless we trust in love
[Chorus]
Don't wanna put my love in you
Don't wanna make a headline and lose
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
[Verse 2]
Why you sayin' one thing
When you mean that
Holding onto nothing
Why you holding back?
'Cause girl I got a problem
Unless we trust
Yeah, girl I got a problem
Trust in love
[Chorus]
Don't wanna put my love in you
Don't wanna make a headline and lose
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
[Bridge]
Do you hear yourself when you speak?
Do you see yourself desperately
Talking shit trying to act like you mad?
I don't know you like that
I don't know you like that
[Chorus]
Don't wanna put my love in you
Don't wanna make a headline and lose
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
You wish you knew
Don't wanna be the one that you choose
'Cause I'm the one, the one, the one that
You wish you knew
