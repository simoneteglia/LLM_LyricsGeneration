[Intro]
Don't you fall for me, girl
I'm not the right kind
I'm a bad man
I will do all I can to keep you by my side
Just 'cause I know it feels right
[Verse]
Explain every story, not boring
Girl, I'll be the only thing up when you're dropping
From purpose
Present and future
Hi, Mr. President, a pleasure to meet you
Hope you feel my presence 'cause it's making a feature
Working on instinct like an extinct creature
Hands all lockin' me in, slide bleacher
Street lamps lit like they're trying to teach us
[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen this scene before, real life
The nature wrote the score, my lines
Look into your eyes, and
[Chorus]
I'm not a good guy
I'm not a good guy
But I know you're mine (Bang)
But I know you're mine (Bang bang)
I'm not a good guy
I'm not a good guy
But I know you're mine (Bang)
But I know you're mine (Bang bang)
