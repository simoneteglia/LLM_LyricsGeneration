[Verse 1]
I can taste it on your mouth and I can't leave it
You're a freak like me, can't you see?
We can work this somethin' out and I'm believin'
You get off on me, it's like cheatin'
[Chorus]
I, I, I, I just wanna watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup, baby, take it off
I just wanna watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off (Take them off)
[Post-Chorus]
Take it off, take it off
Baby, just take it off
Take it off, take it off (Take them off)
Baby, just take it off
[Verse 2]
Push me up against the wall, don't take it easy
You like it hard like me, it's what you need
Let's get naked and explore our inner secrets
For what it is, it's what it is
[Chorus]
I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup, baby, take it off
I just wanna watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
[Post-Chorus]
Take it off, take it off
Baby, just take it off (Take it off)
Take it off, take it off
Baby, just (Take it off)
Take it off, take it off
Baby, just take it off
Take it off, take it off (Off, baby, take it)
Baby, just take it off
[Bridge]
I just can't wait (Can't wait, no) to see it all
I'm so turned on (On) and it's all mine
I just can't wait to see it all
I'm so turned on (On)
[Chorus]
I, I, I, I just wanna watch you when you take it off (Oh)
Take off all your makeup, baby, take it off
I just wanna watch you when you take it off (Take it off)
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
I, I, I, I just wanna watch you when you take it off (I just wanna)
Take off all your makeup, baby, take it off (Just take it off, baby)
I just wanna watch you when you take it off (Take it off)
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
