[Verse 1]
Gangsta Grillz
No remedies, but life lessons to melodies
Sweet science like chemistry, televise this energy
Can't describe four letters be the threat of these
Don't mean to get too deep, but I'm working on better me
Got some ends I gotta meet, left 'em in awe
Ain't got nothing to offer me that I ain’t seen before
Been building up rapport since before we were poor
I've seen a horn now appearing like you open your jaw
The black hole I've been feeding has just opened the door
Left me floating in abyss, I'm a poet 'cause I see things before they exist
I'm an icon without sequins, I'm setting the trends
Got no pals that are famous, I stuck with my friends
My day ones with my Nikes on in the right zone
Is this flight long? Coming back home
Runnin' backwards instead of forward
Me, I'm feeling grown since I had my daughter
Now, I had to change my goals and become a father
And I learned this on my own, this is the life I chose
Won’t become my father, run from my genes in jeans
I'm getting farther from being mean for the unseen
I tell myself that I choose these, don't choose me
Constant contact with insanity since I've been born
Supremacy flawed 'cause you're my enemy
I'm too close for comfort, like Holyfield Belfort
They’re all fightin' for an Oscar
Something wrong with your brain, man
Think you need a doctor, see through you like an actor
I hear fakeness in your laughter
Fuck skipping a page, I'mma skip your whole chapter
Ain't a day that I've aged while I'm spotting the frauds
Unreal like fuck, luck concealed, improved more
Strength in my own core 'til I feel like eyeing up the beanstalk
We're gonna kill the giants 'cause I'm reliant on my talent
Not about the items, fuck the queen, she got knight
I'm for the violence when you write at majesties
All you get is silence, writing letters here in biro
I can't wait to get my gyro, cut your bitter foam off the styro
I just hit another hood slipping Tyrone
Man like Thanos trying to balance on the tightrope
Glad we left the cycles, I'm just focused on the cyclone
I'm a wolf, a were like Lycan, the bars and me are writing
With no bars I'm free like titans, just the beast, and boy I'm fightin'
All my feelings heightened, all I see is vital, the me recital
Don't need revival, don't need an idol, I beat the cyclone
No bike and I'm still riding the beat smiling
[Refrain]
We movin' through the shit, can't we?
We groovin' through the mist
Do you believe, love?
[Verse 2]
No secret  they're not humble, here's a spell of words
Dumbledore, mumble more on a short verse
Stop the search 'cause I found what they're looking for first
Clutch you're purse, I'mma rob you for the thirst
I'll have more swagger in a hearse, praying at church
Saying it first, staying at work, living a blur
Knowing my worth, yeah, I'mma flirt with the idea
Your shit don't fly here, top tier only accepted, no disrespect
We're just separate sex and dissection
Intellectual difference intercept on these Simpsons
Felt primitive like the flintstones and monophonic ringtones
Like sonic in the blue zone
Frankly, I'm going free roam like it's GTA with a time limit
Got an ETA, I'mma kill it like I'm sinning
We don't need the praise, raise the prey
Still I'm brave to face the fears of shitter days
Fuck the puss, I played the game, I got the bars
So, fuck the fame, like a hammer when I MC, can't touch the name
