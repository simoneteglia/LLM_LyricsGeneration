[Verse 1]
Skies of blue and birds of yellow
Flowers growing just to bloom
A million chances of our glances
Catching eyes across the room
[Chorus]
If time stands still
Move I will to you
This world's filled
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you
[Verse 2]
Rain could pour upon your face now
And yet your beauty would still shine
I would live a thousand lifetimes
If it's you I'm sent to find
[Chorus]
If time stands still
Move I will to you
This world's filled
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you
[Bridge]
Move all the water, babe
Lift the rocks up, tide getting stuck
Nothing can stop us
Move all the water, babe
Lift the rocks up, tide getting stuck
Nothing can stop us
[Chorus]
If time stands still
Move I will to you
This world's filled
Somehow I see you
If time stands still (If time stands still)
Move I will to you (Move I will to you)
This world's filled
Somehow I see you (Some how I see you)
Move I will to you
