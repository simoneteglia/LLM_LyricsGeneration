[Verse 1]
Thief time with a ratpack
Samurai gonna Jack that
Got the goods on me like a backpack
Pioneer hybrid force like an inside Prius
Come with a deal like an in-flight meal
Can't take my shine 'cause I implied real
No replies, say my face ideal
Feeling like I'm spaced out an MJ deal
Me, I got the gem on my own work real
Me, I'm trynna murk 'til my own fate's sealed
Got a big mouth, I'm like Kadoh
Green team coming through like K.O
Bruce Lee, drop kick 'em to the face
Move booky, saving the rupees
One time for the Sufis
Who bop strings like blue cheese?
I'm here for the group meet
Pass the tree gonna grow like group me
Found my own kind of route 'til it suits me
Like we live in the movies
Nowadays bitches are bougie
Ice queen coulda fooled me
I scream but it feels like they're roofied
No brain gonna freeze on a hill like Fugees
[Chorus]
I don't need your interest, yeah
I don't need your interest, yeah
I don't need your interest, yeah
On social media
[Verse 2]
Hercules, still lookin' for the Zeus me
Hades tried but he never did phase me
Murked this twice so I put in a statement
Don't need time but I'm needing the patience
Animations, living real life on occasion
Gone through space like I'm phasing
Is it wrong to assume you're amazing?
When you know you belong in a place
And stood on stage
Heart racing never felt wrong
Ain't up for debating
Not adjacent
'Cause I'm killing these dickers like I'm Jason
Grilling these peeps like I'm Jacko
Killer [?] want 'em back home
On a plateau
Lucked out like lotto
Got body to the punch like potto (Hadouken)
[?] motto
Once a year drop gifts like the grotto
Knock on the door and they're not home
I put the ball in the putt hole
On the green and I'm subtle
Mind on a hustle
Skin full of kush while they float in a bubble
Cousins might have double a dozen
Some of 'em young still cute as a button
Telling you now man focus on something
I did this myself
Coming from nothing
Putting a foot in the door
We can do more
If they don't believe it
Just leave them ashore
Livin' abroad
Lovin' my broad
Internation's still broad
In another nation
Back 'cause I'm bored
And my back getting broad
Me, I'm on a spaceship
'Cause I need space to make the next shift
Me, I'm on some next shit
Built different, linguistics
Intrinsic in my being
Words glowing like they're neon scene
In the Matrix on some fake shit
I'm just neo
Ain't afraid of small print
Always looking through the keyhole
I won't make this about you
No disrespect to Ne-yo
What a fucked up generation
Got me wrong I see it blatant
Ain't another with the cadence
Or the pen back home
Read between the lines
Like you scanned bar codes
Ran out all the miles
On this martian-less globe
I'm just ET on my BT
I'm just trying to phone home
Off of this planet
Wish they could ban it
My mission can't man it
Doin' them damage
'Cause I am outstanding
Don't be a G and get battered in manny
You ain't a G man, you is a fanny
You couldn't manage
This weight on your shoulders
'Cause I am a savage
Leading the trag on
It's still in a pattern
I'm owning the patent
Put this into motion like rings onto Saturn
Standing here batting like Brian Lara
Getting lost like Lara Croft
Feeling top heavy, sayonara
Saying nada
Feeling like Super Zayn 'cause I'm going harder
Let it fade like we in the barber
Going Yorkshire like a martyr
Paint a pic 'cause I'm still an artist
Fuck Kanye, beat him farting
Call Leo 'cause we departing
Like a lion but I put the heart in
No case and its free ain't charging
Top tier because we set the margin
Cue the booze we ain't here to lose
Ain't in the box but I got the moves
Tuned into the TV
Yeah we got the news
Yeah, yeah, yeah we got the news
You have got to lose
What I've got to lose
Prescribe me like I'm Dr. Who
Imma shock the yutes
