[Intro]
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It’s messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
[Verse 1]
I see you calling
I didn't wanna leave you like that
It’s five in the morning, yeah, yeah
A hundred on the dash
My wheels are rolling
Ain't taking my foot off the gas
'Cause it only took the one night
To see the end of the line
Staring deep in your eyes, eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
[Chorus]
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
[Verse 2]
I'm too good at knowing
Of when to leave the party behind
Don't care if they notice, yeah, yeah
I’ll just catch a ride
I’d rather be lonely, yeah
Than wrapped around your body too tight
Yeah, I'm the type to get naked
Won’t give my heart up for breaking
'Cause I'm too gone to be staying, staying
[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It’s messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me
[Chorus]
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
Ayy, gotta leave before you love me
