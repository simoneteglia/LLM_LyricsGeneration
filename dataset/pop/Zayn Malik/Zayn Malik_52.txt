[Verse 1]
I've been roaming and strolling
All in the streets
Burning my eyes red
Not slept for weeks
Testing your torment
My future is bleak
Lost in the moment
With no words to speak
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't find no peace
(I can't find no peace)
[Chorus]
Am I a fool
Waiting for you?
What if you never come back?
What if you never come back?
There's nothing new
I made another hit, I made another tune
What if we never know why hearts deceive us?
The night calls to dreamers
[Verse 2]
My sleep was stolen
I'm searching for thieves
These memories in my head
So vivid to see
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't find no peace
(I can't find no peace)
But when I close my eyes I feel it all again
I can't find no peace
[Chorus]
Am I a fool
Waiting for you?
What if you never come back?
What if you never come back?
There's nothing new
I made another hit, I made another tune
What if we never know why hearts deceive us?
The night calls to dreamers
[Bridge]
Insomnia
And when I close my eyes I feel it all again
Insomnia
And when I close my eyes I feel it all again
[Chorus]
Am I a fool
Waiting for you?
What if you never come back?
What if you never come back?
There's nothing new
I made another hit, I made another tune
What if we never know why hearts deceive us?
The night calls to dreamers
