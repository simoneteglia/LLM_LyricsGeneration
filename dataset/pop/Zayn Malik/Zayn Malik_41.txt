[Verse 1: Syd]
Mm, ever been in love?
Ever really loved someone?
People tend to rush
People tend to run to love
Only takes a woman
To show you what it means to love, love
[Chorus: Syd,
ZAYN
]
I'm missin' you tonight, yeah (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
I'm wishin' you were right here
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
[Verse 2: ZAYN]
(Yeah, oh-oh, oh)
Never feels right
Never feel that type of way
But I need you in my life
Yeah, you could be my wifе for real
Only takes a woman
To show you what it means to lovе (Love)
To love
[Chorus: Syd & ZAYN,
ZAYN
,
Syd
]
I'm missin' you tonight, yeah (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
I'm wishin' you were right here
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
[Bridge: ZAYN]
Keep me up until the mornin'
You could see it in my aura
You've been givin' it your all and I'm fallin' for you
Keep me up until the mornin'
You could see it in my aura
You've been givin' it your all and I'm fallin' for you
[Outro: Syd,
ZAYN
]
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
