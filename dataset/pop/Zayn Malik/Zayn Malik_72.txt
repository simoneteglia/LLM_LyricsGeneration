[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Climb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow
[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN &
Tyler, The Creator
]
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
(Pillow talk)
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
(Ooh)
I love to wake up next to you
(Pillow talk)
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
(Ooh)
I love to wake up next to you
(Pillow talk)
[Chorus: ZAYN &
Tyler, The Creator
]
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
(Pillow talk)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
(Pillow talk)
[Verse 2: ZAYN]
Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free, it's a thin line
[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN &
Tyler, The Creator
]
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
(Pillow talk)
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
(Ooh)
I love to wake up next to you
(Pillow talk)
[Chorus: ZAYN &
Tyler, The Creator
]
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
(Ooh)
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
(Ooh)
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
(Pillow talk)
[Outro: ZAYN &
Tyler, The Creator
]
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
(Pillow talk, pillow talk)
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone
(Pillow talk, pillow talk)
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
(Pillow talk, pillow talk)
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone
(Pillow talk, pillow talk)
