[Verse 1]
Hey what's up? It's been a while
Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Know it's late but I'm so wired
Saw your face and got inspired
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
[Chorus]
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
[Breakdown]
[Verse 2]
Talkin' don't want me cause I want you
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
[Chorus]
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
[Breakdown]
[Chorus]
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
