[Verse 1]
Tell me where your car's at
Do you wanna drive home?
I could drive ya
Is it the one with the light on
On the third floor
With your heart, on the window?
I don't need nothing from you
I got everything I need
Right here, it's right here
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't take it the wrong way
But this is a, different, kind of love
Don't take it the wrong way
But this is a, different, kind of love
[Chorus]
Different kind of love
Different, different, kind of love, kind of love
Different kind of love
Differеnt, this is a, different, kind of love
[Verse 2]
Nеver play ya
Hide in, your apartment
Take your clothes off leave 'em there
On the pile of the towels
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't take it the wrong way
But this is a, different, kind of love
Don't take it the wrong way
But this is a, different, kind of love
[Chorus]
Different kind of love
Different, different, kind of love, kind of love
Different kind of love
Different, this is a, different, kind of love
[Bridge]
Do you feel what I feel? Does it feel right?
Let you up, light you up
Like a street light
And there ain't nothing artificial
If you're really mine, really mine
Do you feel what I feel? Does it feel right?
Let you up, light you up
Like a street light
And there ain't nothing artificial
If you're really mine, really mine
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't take it the wrong way
But this is a, different, kind of love
This is a, different, kind of love
Don't take it the wrong way
But this is a, different, kind of love
This is a, different, kind of love
[Chorus]
Different kind of love
Different, this is a, different kind of love, kind of love
Different kind of love
[Outro]
You want me wasting no time on us, time on us
This is a different kind of love
Different kind of love
