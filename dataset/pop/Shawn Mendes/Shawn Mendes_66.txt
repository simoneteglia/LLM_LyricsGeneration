[Verse 1]
Smoke in the air, the city's burnin' down
I wanna speak, but I don't make a sound
Locked in my mind, you're all I think about (Mm)
I wanna save us, but I don't know how
[Chorus]
If we don't love like we used to
If we don't care like we used to
What the hell are we dying for?
If it doesn't cut like it used to
If you're not mine and I'm not yours
What the hell are we dying for?
[Verse 2]
I see it in the news, I see it in your eyes, oh
I try to let you go, then I choke, I change my mind
(Change my mind, ooh)
Let's face thе truth, I'm terrified (Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
If we don't lovе like we used to
If we don't care like we used to
What the hell are we dying for?
If it doesn't cut like it used to
If you're not mine and I'm not yours
What the hell are we dying for?
[Bridge]
Livin' without you
Is not livin' at all
[Chorus]
If we don't love like we used to
And we don't care like we used to
What the hell are we dying for?
If it doesn't cut like it used to (Doesn't cut)
If you're not mine and I'm not yours (I'm not yours)
What the hell are we dying for?
[Outro]
Livin' without you
Is not livin' at all
Livin' without you (Baby)
Is not livin' at all
So what the hell are we dying for?
