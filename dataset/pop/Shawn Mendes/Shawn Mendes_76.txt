[Verse 1]
Taking it slow isn't easy if as far as you go
Is only half as far as you and I both know, yeah
Coming up from above, a little something
And it's only because I don't ever wanna see you in love
But I know
That you've been coming off strong lately and I can feel it that
You've been thinking that maybe, you got a
Another shot at me, thinking possibly somehow, but not now
And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder that's beating my head to the ground
But I, I know
[Chorus]
That I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have, it's black and burnt
My God this is so sad, it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back
[Bridge]
And I mean if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
Then baby honestly yeah, you're not the one for me
[Chorus]
And I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have, it's black and burnt
My God this is so sad, it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back
If we bring it back, no
If we bring it back, oh
If we bring it back
If we bring it back
