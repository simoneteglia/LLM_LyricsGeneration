[Verse 1]
You say it's not supposed to be
Tell me not to waste my time
This was never up to me
But if it was I wouldn't mind
And I'm trying to ignore you
I try to go on with my day, hey
But I still pick up the phone, yeah
And get lost in what you say
[Chorus]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down, like this
[Verse 2]
And I love it how she's honest
You don't find that nowadays
She's not even drop dead gorgeous
But she kills me anyway, oh
[Chorus]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
[Bridge]
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down like this
[Chorus]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
[Outro]
I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down I've lost this fight
And I thought I was strong, enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth
So I guess I'm going down, like this
