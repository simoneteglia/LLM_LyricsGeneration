Something that's pushing me
Just can't take you needs, yeah
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get you out off my mind
Ohhh yeahh
I see you in the morning
Going down the street
I wanna say something
But I can't move my feet
Yeah ohhh-oh
Something that's pushing me
Just can't take you needs
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get her out off my mind
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get her off my mind, oh
Can't get her off my mind
Can't get her off my mind, yeah
Can't get her off my mind, yeah
Can't get her off my mind
