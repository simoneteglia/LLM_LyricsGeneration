[Intro: Shawn Mendes]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
[Bridge: Shawn Mendes]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da - that's okay
[Chorus: Teddy Geiger &
Shawn Mendes
]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes]
Day day dum mm hm
Da da oh, yeah
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days it never rains, but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Uh oh
Ee da de da de
Ee da de da de da de da
[Chorus: Teddy Geiger &
Shawn Mendes
]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
[Bridge: Shawn Mendes &
Teddy Geiger
]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why—why—why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
[Verse 3: Shawn Mendes]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
[Outro: Teddy Geiger &
Shawn Mendes
&
Both
]
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares us to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
under pressure
Under pressure, yeah
Under pressure, uh
Pressure
