[Intro]
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
Met this girl when I was three years old
We were holding hands tight so I’m told
And it felt like an eternity
Said it felt like an eternity
Cause I knew back then we were more than friends
Two-sides of the story, it all depends
And I'll say it once and I'll say it again
It'll only end up hurting me
Years flew by, I was less than twelve
Long division, I need your help
Can you come on over and work with me?
Any time you like, I’ll make it work for me
Cause I knew back when if I get you close
When the times is right maybe I'll propose
Baby climb on up
Show me the ropes
[Chorus]
Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, mm yeah
[Verse 2]
So come on girl let me hold your hand, let's go get lost, leave without a plan
And I know you got the world to see, but you know you mean the world to me
And I know right now you got second thoughts
Do whatever it takes, pay whatever the cost, yeah
You know me, not the type of guy to sneak around, to do the time
But you must have me hypnotized
I'm d-d-d down to be by your side (yeah)
Every night
[Chorus]
Darling, I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings
[Bridge]
And baby when you fall down, I'll fall too
And if you get lost, then I'll get lost with you
And when the waves crash down
Then, baby, I won't move, cause I-I-I
[Chorus]
Need all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Cause baby, I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
I want all the strings, all the strings attached
All the strings attached girl
And all the strings attached girl, oh yeah
