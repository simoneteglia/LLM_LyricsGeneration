[Intro]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
[Verse 1]
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
O sonho que trago comigo
Se acreditar sonho contigo
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?
[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar
[Verse 2]
I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...
[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar
[Bridge]
Que vamos conseguir
Que vamos conquistar
Nós somos Portugal
Uma só voz e um coração
[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar, oh
[Outro]
It isn't in my blood
Que vamos conquistar
Nós somos Portugal
Uma só voz e um coração
It isn't in my blood
