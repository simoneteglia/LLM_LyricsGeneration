[Verse 1]
You can’t walk the streets at night
You're way too short to get on this ride
No I'm not, no I'm not, they're tryna tell me that I
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?
You can’t watch your TV show
I will watch what I wanna watch
No, I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do
[Chorus]
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
[Verse 2]
Watch me swim across this lake
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape
Watch me walk across this wire
Tip toe through the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me fly this kite in the rain
I’ll jump rope with my ball and chain
Come by and knock on my house of cards
If it falls I will build it from the start
I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do
[Chorus]
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
[Verse 3]
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down
[Chorus]
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
[Outro]
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you
