[Verse 1]
You hit me up, it's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistakes, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy
[Chorus]
First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please, I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah
[Verse 2]
I'm in your room, it's just us two
I feel you getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest, yeah
Deep down I know that this should be the last time I come over
You always leave me such a mess
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me crazy
[Chorus]
First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah
[Bridge]
And you gotta stop, if you know
So I can start, letting go
'Cause it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, you keep drivin' me crazy
[Chorus]
When you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Yeah, you're driving me crazy
[Outro]
First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah
Please, I'm losing my patience, yeah
