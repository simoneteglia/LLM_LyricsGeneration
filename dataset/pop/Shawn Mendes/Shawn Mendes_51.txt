[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes &
Astrid S
]
Never thought that we would end up here
Should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we're trying way too hard
Used to think that we would last forever
How could I have been so wrong?
Never thought I'd be the one to say this
What if our time has come and gone?
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Astrid S]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
[Verse 2:
Astrid S
& Shawn Mendes]
Always tryna put your two cents in
And expecting me to change
Tried to fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained
Told you not to tie me down too quickly
Take it slow, it's not a race
And you keep on tryna reel me in but
All I really need is space
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Astrid S]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
[Bridge: Shawn Mendes]
Trying to hold me down but I'm surfacing
Itâ€™s hard to let you go but I gotta leave
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Astrid S]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, I'm coming up for air
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringing me along and I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me, this time I'm coming up for air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
Air, air, air, air, air, air
A-air, a-air, a-air, air
