[Intro]
[Verse 1: Sam Tsui &
Alexander Stewart
]
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up
To be ordinary
Make your best mistakes
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So, baby, be the life of the party
[Pre-Chorus: Sam Tsui &
Alexander Stewart
]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
[Chorus 1: Sam Tsui,
Alexander Stewart
]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
Oh, I've been shaking
Baby, there's nothing holding me back
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But you've got that one thing
[Bridge: Sam Tsui &
Alexander Stewart
]
I know what you did last summer
Just lied to me, "There's no other"
Go crazy, crazy, crazy â€™til we see the sun
I know what you did last summer
Look me in the eyes, my lover
Tonight let's get some, and live while we're young
[Pre-Chorus: Sam Tsui &
Alexander Stewart
]
Have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Oh, won't you please have
All these lights
They can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
[Chorus 2: Sam Tsui &
Alexander Stewart
]
Mercy, mercy
The story of my life, I take her home
Mercy, mercy
The story of my life, I give her hope
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
[Verse 2: Sam Tsui &
Alexander Stewart
]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went Ohh Woah Ooh
Ohh Woah Ooh
We knew every line, now I can't remember
I think it went Ohh Woah Ooh
Something Big I feel it happening
[Pre-Chorus: Sam Tsui]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
[Chorus 3: Sam Tsui &
Alexander Stewart
]
I know I can treat you better
Oh everybody wanna steal my girl
And any girl like you deserves a
A couple billion in the whole wide world
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
Oh just how fast the night changes
I know I can treat you better
[Outro: Sam Tsui]
Yeah yeah
And let me kiss you
