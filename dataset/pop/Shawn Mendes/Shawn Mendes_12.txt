[Intro: Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes]
Ah-ah, he-hey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, he-hey
Ah-ah, ah-ah
[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killin' me?
He knows, he knows
D-D-Does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin?
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows
[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes,
Camila Cabello
&
Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello
]
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (
I'm slippin' away
)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (
The pictures on my phone
)
She's not coming home (
I'm not comin' home
)
Comin' home, comin' home
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes,
Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello
]
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
)
Just lied to me, "There's no other" (
He-hey
)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
)
Look me in the eyes, my lover (
He-hey
)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello,
Shawn Mendes
&
Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes
]
I know, I know, I know, I know (
Ah-ah
), I know, I know, I know (
He-ey
)
I know, I know, I know, I know
(
Ah-ah
)
, I know, I know, I know
(
Ah-ah
)
I didn't mean it, no (
Ah-ah
), I didn't mean it, mean it, no (
He-hey
)
Can't seem to let you go
(
Ah-ah
)
, can't seem to hold you close
(
Ah-ah
)
[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes]
I know
When she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright no more, no more
I know
That she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die
[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes,
Camila Cabello
&
Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello
]
It's tearing me apart (
It's tearin' me apart
)
She's slipping away (
I'm slipping away
)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone
(
The pictures on my phone
)
She's not coming home (
I'm not comin' home
)
Oh, nah, nah, nah, oh-yeah
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes,
Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello
]
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
)
Just lied to me, "There's no other" (
He-hey
)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
I know what you did last summer (
Ah-ah
)
Look me in the eyes, my lover (
He-hey
)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
[Bridge: Shawn Mendes,
Camila Cabello
&
Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello
]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
(
No, no
)
Can't seem to let you go
Can't seem to keep you close (
Hold me close
)
I can't seem to let you go
Can't seem to keep you close (
You know I didn't mean it, though
)
Tell me where you've been lately
Tell me where you've been lately (
Just hold me close
)
Tell me where you've been lately
Tell me where you've been lately (
Do-Don't-Don't let me go
)
Can't seem to keep you close
I can't seem to let you go (
I didn't mean it, though
)
I know you didn't mean it, though
I know you didn't mean it, though (
I don't wanna let you go
)
Tell me you didn't mean it, though (
No, no, no
)
Tell me you didn't mean it, though (
Can't seem to let you go
)
I know you didn't mean it, though (
Seem to let you go
)
I wanna know you mean it, though (
Hold me close
)
I know you didn't mean it, though (
Just hold me close
)
I know you didn't mean it, though
I can't seem to let you go, can't seem to hold you close
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
I know what you did last summer (Ah-ah)

Look me in the eyes, my lover (He-hey)
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you've been
[Post-Chorus: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello,
