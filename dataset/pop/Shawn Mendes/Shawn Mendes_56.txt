[Verse 1]
Please don't tell me that he's just a friend
Don't you touch me and act all innocent
'Cause when you're sitting on my bed
And you look at me like that
It's easy to forget
Please don't lie, we got too much to lose
And pretend he means nothing to you
And you could try to make it right
But it's not so black and white
Oh, I've got nothing left
[Chorus]
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
[Verse 2]
And does he love you like the way I did?
And was it worth it the night you spent with him?
How could you go and risk it all?
Blame it on the alcohol
Now you can save your breath
Oh, you can save your breath
[Chorus]
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
[Bridge]
It doesn't make it any better
When you say, "It's not my fault"
I really thought I knew you better
Guess I don't know you at all
[Chorus]
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
