[Verse 1]
I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight
[Chorus]
We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words
[Verse 2]
We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother
It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no, oh no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further
[Chorus]
Oh, we're going through the motions (yeah)
Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
[Bridge]
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
I'm tired, I can't take it anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
We're tired, we can't take it anymore
[Chorus]
We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, no
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
I won't keep on saying those three empty words
[Outro]
We don't have to keep on saying those three empty words
No I can't keep on saying those three empty words
