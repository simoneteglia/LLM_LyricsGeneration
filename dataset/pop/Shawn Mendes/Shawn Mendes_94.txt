Ed Sheeran - "Shape of You"
[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body, yeah
Oh-oh-oh
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of...
Shawn Mendes - "Mercy"
[Verse 1]
You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
[Hook]
I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Won't you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Mercy, mercy on my heart
Ed Sheeran - "Shape of You"
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I might be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
Cheat Codes & Dante - "Let Me Hold You (Turn Me On)"
[Chorus]
Let me hold you, girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you, girl whine all around me, yeah
Ed Sheeran - "Shape of You"
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
