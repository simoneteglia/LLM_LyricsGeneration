[Verse 1]
In the shadow of the city
When the days have disappeared
Some might say it's sorta gritty
Full of faces to be feared
[Pre-Chorus]
But there are wonders that are waiting
Underneath the midnight sky
We got the stars illuminating
It’s a place for you and I
A little space for a you and I
[Chorus]
At the top of the world tonight
Where no one ever has to hide
At the top of the world tonight
You're sittin' safe and starry-eyed
There is treasure you can find
In somethin’ someone left behind
At the top of the world tonight
It can stay this way at least until the mornin' light
[Verse 2]
Through the dark there's someone's singin'
Like an old familiar song
Like you fell into a melody that's bringin' you right here
Where you can belong
[Pre-Chorus]
And there are wonders that are waiting
Underneath the midnight sky and
By the stars, we're navigating
To a place for a you and I
[Chorus]
At the top of the world tonight
Where no one ever has to hide
At the top of the world tonight
You’re sittin’ safe and starry-eyed
There is treasure you can find
In somethin' someone left behind
At the top of the world tonight
It can stay this way at least until the mornin’ light
[Outro]
At the top of the world
The top of the world
The top of the world tonight
