[Verse 1]
Oh, I don't understand it when you talk like that
Swear I thought you were joking and that's why I laughed
'Cause it sounds like you wasted but it's 10 am
Maybe I'm going crazy, but I don't think I am
[Pre-Chorus]
Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe
[Chorus]
But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
And the rest was just wobbling
Girl I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
[Verse 2]
Girl I can't understand you when you act like that
Yeah your eyes are looking through me, like I'm made of glass
And my lips try to kiss you, but you don't kiss back
No, I don't understand you when you act like that
[Pre-Chorus]
Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe
[Chorus]
But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
Than the rest was just wobbling
Oh, I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
