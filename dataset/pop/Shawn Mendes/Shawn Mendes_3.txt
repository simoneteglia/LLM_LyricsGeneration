[Intro]
Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
[Verse 1]
Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?
[Pre-Chorus]
Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
[Verse 2]
I'm lookin' through my phone again, feelin' anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm tryin' to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could help me?
[Pre-Chorus]
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood (Ey)
[Bridge]
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now
[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't
[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood (Ooh-ooh)
It isn't in my blood, ohh (Ooh, ooh)
[Outro]
It isn't in my blood (Ooh-ooh)
I need somebody now (Ooh-ooh)
It isn't in my blood (Ooh-ooh)
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
