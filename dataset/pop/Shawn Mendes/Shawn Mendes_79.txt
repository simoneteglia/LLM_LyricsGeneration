[Verse 1]
Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times but I
I just sat next to my phone
[Pre-Chorus]
Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh
[Chorus]
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
[Verse 2]
Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I never thought I'd say goodbye
[Pre-Chorus]
Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh
[Chorus]
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
[Bridge]
Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no
[Chorus]
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry, but I have to go
