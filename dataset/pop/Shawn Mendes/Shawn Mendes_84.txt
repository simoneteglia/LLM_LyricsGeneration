[Pre-Chorus: Camilo]
If you tell me now that you want me by your side
That would be nice
'Cause you with that little mouth already have me hypnotized
I would kiss you
[Chorus: Camilo]
But you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
Ay, you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
Ay, you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
Ay, you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
[Verse: Shawn Mendes &
Camilo
]
Baby, yeah
What would you do if I got down on my knees?
What if I flipped our whole world upside down now?
You know that we fit togethеr, you're my queen (
You're my queen, you're my queen
)
Gеt close to me
I know that it's too soon to have this conversation
But I can't help myself, I'm runnin' out of patience
You know I got you forever (
Eh-eh
)
Come on, give into the pleasure (
Ah
)
So put up your flags and surrender
You are my treasure, oh yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes &
Camilo
]
If you tell me now that you want me by your side
That would be nice (
That would be nice, baby
)
'Cause you with that little mouth already have me hypnotized (
Hypnotized
)
I would kiss you
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes]
But you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
Ay, you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
Ay, you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
Ay, you don't tell me "yes," "yes," "yes," "yes"
[Post-Chorus: Camilo,
Camillo & Shawn Mendes
]
I love you just the way you are (You are)
A very natural flow
I love you just the way you are
A very natural flow (Oh)
I love you just the way you are
A very natural flow
(Oh-oh)
I love you just the way you are
A natural flow
