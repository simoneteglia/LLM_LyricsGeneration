[Verse 1]
Guess there's something about it
That I can't explain
We could see other people
But it's never the same
You could be in Toronto
And I could be in L.A
And we could wait too long
But it's never too late
[Chorus]
And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
[Verse 2]
We tried to deny it
Ever since we were kids
Yeah, we both tried to fight it
But we never win
We tell everybody, yeah
That we were just friends
But the more that I kiss you
The less it makes sense
[Chorus]
And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
[Bridge]
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
[Chorus]
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
[Outro]
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
