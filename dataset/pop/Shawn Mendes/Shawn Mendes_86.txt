[Verse 1]
Can I open my mouth and let the words come spilling out?
Show you the side of me that I haven’t figured out?
And I want you to know all the things that I think about
Can I let it out?
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I want you to be there
Yeah, I want you to be there
[Chorus]
If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
[Verse 2]
Could we talk through the night if I told you I never sleep?
Could you be the air in my lungs when I can’t breathe?
And sometimes I’m not quite as strong as I wanna be
It's why I want you to be there, be there, be there
[Chorus]
If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
[Bridge]
So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, ohh
So much of me I wanna let go
So many things I need you to know
So much of me I wanna let go, ohh ohh
[Chorus]
If I told you my secrets and I showed you my weakness
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
If I told you my thoughts and showed you all of my scars
Would you love me or leave me?
Tell me, how would you see me?
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
Love me or leave me
