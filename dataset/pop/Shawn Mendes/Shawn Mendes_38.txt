[Verse 1]
It's a fairytale I can't explain
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I know I'd still be searching, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
[Chorus]
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
Ah, It's always been you
[Verse 2]
And you've seen all my darkest fears
Like you've known me for a thousand years
The boy who's really underneath
All the scars and insecurities, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
[Chorus]
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
Ah, It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
[Outro]
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-ooh
It's always been you, yeah
Ah-ah-ah woo-ooh
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
