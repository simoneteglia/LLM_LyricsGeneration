[Verse 1]
Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah-eh-ehh
[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
[Verse 2]
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody care-ares
[Chorus]
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah
Oh yeah-eh-ehh
[Bridge]
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah-eh I know
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no yeah-eh
'Cause we all get lost sometimes
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-ehh-ehhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am
[Interlude]
When you wake up, your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know you gotta, you gotta go with it
And, that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go, and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on, to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was
But at the end of the day, you know?
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change
[Chorus]
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-ehhhh-ehhh-ehhhhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am
