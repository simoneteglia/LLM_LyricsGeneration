[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
[Verse 1]
I don't know, how does it go?
I promise that I love you
So I'll bet it all on me and you
I'll bet it all, you're bulletproof
Let's throw away our backup plans
And people might not understand
Who cares about if they approve?
I'd face them all to be with you
[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
[Verse 2]
I heard that once a wise man said
"Only fools go rushing in"
But I'm not the type to overthink
When something feels so right
And I promise I mean every word
I'll paint the world that you deserve
Every color you'd imagine
I can't wait for it to happen 'cause
[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
[Verse 3]
I heard that once a wise man said
"Only fools go rushing in"
But I'm not the type (I'm not the type), to overthink (Overthink)
I'm not the type to overthink
[Chorus]
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon
But I wanna come home to you
