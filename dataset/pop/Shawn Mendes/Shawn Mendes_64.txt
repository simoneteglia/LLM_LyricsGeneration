[Verse 1]
Kisses on your body were like heaven, we were takin' it slow
Tangled in the sheets until the evenin', there was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learnin' each other's shapes, tracin'
Shadows of rain down your back, oh-oh
Kisses on your body in my memory, baby, nothing comes close
[Chorus]
It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
[Post-Chorus]
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love

Meditation and
tequila
Calling you my señorita
Didn't know how much I need ya
Hate it when I have to leave ya
I've been taking mental pictures
For when I miss you in the winter
Stayin' up until the sunrise
Prayin' it won't be the last time
[Chorus]
It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
[Post-Chorus]
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah (Ohh)
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love
[Bridge]
Kisses on your body were like heaven, we were takin' it slow, yeah
Entangled in the sheets until the evenin', there was nowhere to go, no
[Chorus]
It was the summer of love (You were my summer of love)
A delicate daydream (A delicate daydream)
And for a couple of months (And for a couple of months)
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
[Post-Chorus]
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of
La-la-love
La-la-love, yeah
It was the summer of–
