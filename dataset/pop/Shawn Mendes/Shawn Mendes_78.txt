[Verse 1]
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can’t reach
[Chorus]
You know that I could use somebody
Yeah, you know that I could use somebody
[Verse 2]
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the street
[Chorus]
You know that I could use somebody
Yeah you know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you (Use somebody)
[Verse 3]
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep, no
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it’s gonna make you notice
[Chorus]
Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (oh)
Someone like me (use somebody)
You know that I could use somebody
[Outro]
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
