[Verse 1]
Hey, how's it going?
Can you meet me down on Adelaide Street?
Can you talk for a moment?
There's no way to say this that easily
And everything I said, I swear I meant it
I need to tell you that this isn't your fault
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And it kills me cause the worst part of all
[Chorus]
Is that I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya
[Verse 2]
Hey, can you listen?
I swear to God to you, there's nobody else
You're gonna say that I'm lying
When I tell you every feeling I felt
Was honest and sincere in that you were different
And when we kissed I felt like that kid in love, yeah
And I know that I'll probably regret it
I might wish I never said this at all
[Chorus]
Oh I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna see you cry
Oh, oh, oh
Swear that I don't wanna see you cry
[Chorus]
'Cause I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just tryna be honest
I hate to hurt you
But I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need, oh
You deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby I'm just tryna be honest
