[Verse 1]
I know that I have made mistakes
Like when I introduced you as a friend
And I pray to God it's not too late
As I'm dreaming wide awake again
Yeah, we got so close I couldn't see
Laughing while we painted my room, yeah
And all along the joke's on me
Now you're happier with someone new
[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me
[Verse 2]
When I call you late, I know he's there
But you still pick up and leave the bed
You speak low so he can't hear
And it gives me hope there's something left
[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me
[Verse 3]
And when you ask me who I'm seeing now
I wanna say it's you I'm thinking about
I'm tryna find the words somehow
To say the things that I never said
I'd do whatever it takes, I need to know what'd you say
Cause you've got a hold on me, yeah, you got a hold of me
[Chorus]
What if I told you a story
All about someone who loves you
And what if I told you he's sorry he made you wait
And what if I told you he's dying 'cause he can't change history
And what if I told you that someone was me
[Verse 4]
I'm ready to tell you a story
I am somebody who loves you
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
And darling just listen don't worry
We could go down in history
Why don't you let your somebody be me?
