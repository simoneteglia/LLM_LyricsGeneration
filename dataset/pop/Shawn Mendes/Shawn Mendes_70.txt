[Verse 1]
Think I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know
Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know
[Chorus]
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me
[Verse 2]
You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know
All of this is getting really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know
[Chorus]
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me
[Bridge]
Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know
[Chorus]
That you give me this crazy feeling
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me
