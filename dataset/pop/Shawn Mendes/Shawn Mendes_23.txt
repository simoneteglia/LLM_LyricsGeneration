[Intro Whistling]
[Verse 1]
I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now
[Chorus]
Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
[Instrumental Break: Whistling]
[Post-Chorus]
You'll never be alone
[Verse 2]
When you miss me, close your eyes
I may be far, but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight
Just remember that we lay under the same stars
[Pre-Chorus]
And hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now
[Chorus]
And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
[Bridge]
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
[Chorus]
And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You will never be alone
