[Verse 1]
I wake up a little drunk
Check my phone, I'm all alone
Ten missed calls, a couple texts
None of them are who I'm lookin' for
Who I'm lookin' for, yeah
[Chorus]
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one
[Verse 2]
Get on a plane
Fly to the most beautiful place you've ever been
Close my eyes, things are better in my dreams
'Cause I'm with someone, someone I adore
[Chorus]
This is a song for no one
I wrote this song for no one
[Verse 3]
Yesterday, I got pretty drunk
Said some things that I shouldn't have
Told you that I really love you
You did not reciprocate those feelings
But that's okay, I'll be fine anyway
Ooh, yeah, hey, yeah
[Chorus]
I wrote this song for no one
I wrote this song
Woo, woo, woo, woo
No, I wrote this song for no one
