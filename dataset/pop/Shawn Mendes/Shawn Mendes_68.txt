[Verse 1]
Right now, I'm alone inside the airport
And you're all at a bar in our hometown
Feels like we've been living different lives
The music's loud and everybody's dancing
How many nights I've missed, yeah, I've lost count
Haven't seen your faces in a while
[Chorus]
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends
[Verse 2]
I don't wanna miss another birthday
Feels like it's been forever since nineteen
I just wanna be right where you are
I miss how it was when we wishеd we were oldеr
Feeling so far when I wanna be closer
[Chorus]
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends
[Bridge]
Ooh, I know you gotta make some sacrifices
Ooh, don't wanna be alone for one more night
Ooh, I know you gotta make some sacrifices
But I should call my friends
[Chorus]
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends
