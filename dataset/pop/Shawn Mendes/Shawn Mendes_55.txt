[Verse 1]
And I know that we just met and maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
'Cause it's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
[Verse 2]
The way you're lighting up the room
Caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we donâ€™t have to say goodbye
'Cause it's alright, it's alright
To waste time tonight
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
And maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby, if this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
And maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby, it'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I got it all, all, all, all
And all, all, all, all
And I got it all, all, all, all
But I don't ever wanna grow up
[Verse 3]
Said your place is kinda close and your 'rents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure, but if you're down, I'm down
'Cause it's alright, it's alright
To just talk tonight
[Verse 4]
If you're feeling kinda crazy, turn down the lights
We can take our time, do whatever you like
It's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
And maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby, if this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
And maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby, it'd be fine if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I got it all, all, all, all
And all, all, all, all
And I got it all, all, all, all
But I don't ever wanna grow up
'Cause I got it all, all, all, all
And all, all, all, all
And I got it all, all, all, all
But I don't ever wanna grow up
[Bridge]
You make me feel
Like I got it all, yeah
And you make me feel
Like I'm just a kid in love
And you make me feel (All, all, all, all)
Like I got it all (All, all, all, all)
And you make me feel (I got it all, all, all, all)
Like I don't ever wanna grow up
[Chorus]
And maybe we're just kids in love
And maybe we're just kids in love
Oh, baby, if this is what it's like falling in love
Then we don't ever have to grow up
And maybe we're just kids in love
And maybe we're just kids in love
Oh, baby, when we're alone and it's the two of us
And I can't get enough
[Post-Chorus]
I've got it all (All, all, all, all)
Yeah, yeah (All, all, all, all)
I've got it all (I've got it all, all, all, all)
Yeah (I've got it all)
And I've got it, and I've got it all (I've got it all, all, all, all)
And I've got it, and we've got it all (All, all, all, all)
And I've got it, and I've got it all (I've got it all, all, all, all)
But I don't ever wanna grow up
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-yeah
