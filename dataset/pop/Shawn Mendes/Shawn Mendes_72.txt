[Intro]
Yeah, it makes me wanna cry
Don't know what to do
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece
[Verse 1]
I get reckless, I'm obsessive
I'm pathetic and possessive
You're so sure it makes me insecure
You're majestic, mesmerizin'
Light the room up without tryin'
Baby, I'm so into you, it hurts
[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share
[Chorus]
Everybody wants a piece of you
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piecе
[Verse 2]
One, two, three
So do I, maybe I'm selfish
Just onе touch is so electric
Every little thing you do feels right, yeah
I'm sorry if I get protective
Need these boys to get the message
You know I'm yours, I know you're mine
[Chorus]
Everybody wants a piece of you, yeah
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece
[Bridge]
It's so hard, but it's true
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece
[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share
[Chorus]
Everybody wants a piece of you
(Now they all want a piece)
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
(Nah, it just isn't fair, babe)
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece
