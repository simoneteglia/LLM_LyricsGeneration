[Verse 1]
Stop, take it in
And I breathe for a minute
I think too much when I'm alone
I never win when I
Keep all my thoughts inside
So I'll pick up the phone
[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says, "Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven’t seen you lately
But you’re always on my mind"
[Chorus]
I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
[Verse 2]
These days are flying by
Weeks feel like minutes
I can't remember being small
I try to figure it out
I can't seem to find out how
I guess I don't know much at all
[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says
"Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven’t seen you lately
But you’re always on my mind"
[Chorus]
I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
[Bridge]
All we can do is hold on
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just, just hold on
Just hold on for me
[Pre-Chorus]
And my dad says
"Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright."
[Chorus]
I don't know what
You’re going through
But there’s so much life
Ahead of you
And it won’t slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just hold on for me
