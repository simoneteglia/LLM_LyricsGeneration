She'll be the one who breaks my heart
She'll be the love I can't let go
She'll be the light who breaks my dark
She'll be the love I can't let go
But how can I not try?
Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh
She'll be the love who breaks my heart
She'll be the one I can't let go
She'll be the light to break my dark
She'll be the one
She'll be the one I can't let go
But how can
How can I not try?
Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh
To break my heart
She'll be the one to break my fall
Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh
She'll be the one to break my heart
Cause I love her so much I'll fall apart, oh
She'll be the one to break my fall, oh
She'll be the one to break my heart
Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no
Cause she'll be the one to break my heart
She'll be the [?] who rips me apart
She'll be the one who'll break my heart (yeah)
She'll be the one who'll break my heart
And I haven't even met her yet
But I know, she'll go and break my heart
Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh
Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no
How can I not try?
How can I not try?
How can I not try?
How can I not try?
Ooh, Ooh
Ooh, Ooh
