[Verse 1]
Damn, you look so good with your clothes on
And I'm not trying to come off too strong
But you know that I can't help It
Cause girl you're beautiful
I can't deny I want your body
But I'm a gentleman so I'll be
The one who takes it slowly
Cause girl you're so beautiful
[Chorus]
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
And hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Hey, hey, no
[Verse 2]
I like the vibe in this hotel room
And I'd really like to get to know you
Start discovering your secrets
Underneath these very sheets
Your skin's so perfect up against me
Your lips are talking when we don't speak
And I never wanna leave this
Cause there's so much left to see
[Chorus]
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
And hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on (I wanna love you)
And hold you 'til the nights gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on
