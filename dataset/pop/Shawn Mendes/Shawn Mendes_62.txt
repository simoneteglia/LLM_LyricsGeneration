[Chorus]
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
[Verse 1]
Without you, all the birds would stop their songs
Without you, all things right would feel so wrong
[Chorus]
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
[Verse 2]
Without you, I'd always be alone
Without you, I don't know where to go
[Chorus]
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world could be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine
I can't imagine, no
I can't imagine, no, what a world would be
Without you
[Outro]
I'd always be alone
I'd always be alone
Cool, that's good for now
