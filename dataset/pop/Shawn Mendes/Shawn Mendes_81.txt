[Verse 1]
Time warp in the middle of a daydream
Call you up 'cause the time is wasting
Last drive, we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don't stumble
We can't do this alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back
It's now or never
[Chorus]
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights
[Verse 2]
We're young livin' with no fear
Kids runnin' wild, girls cryin' drunk tears
We don't have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Caught up in the night, oh, we missed the last train
It's that time, and we're leaving, home
[Pre-Chorus]
Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back
It's now or never
[Chorus]
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights
[Refrain]
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
[Bridge]
Go home, it's over, but it's not the end
Don't wait 'til you're older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence
Where do we go? We don't know
One of those nights, we're driving around
In this boring ass town
One of those nights
[Refrain]
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
[Chorus]
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights
[Outro]
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
One of those nights, where she turns the lights down
And it's only us now, one of those nights
