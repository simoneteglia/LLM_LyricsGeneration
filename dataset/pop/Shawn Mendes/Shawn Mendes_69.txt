[Verse 1]
I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And 'am I the one you're dreaming of?'
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams
[Chorus]
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes
[Verse 2]
You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams
[Chorus]
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
[Bridge]
Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on
[Chorus]
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls, these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes
