[Verse 1]
You've got my heart, but I can't let you keep it, babe
'Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time trying to pull me in
'Cause I'm just a mess you don't wanna fix
Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now, kiss me softly before I say
[Chorus]
And don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you
[Verse 2]
And just know that I do, oh I really like you, babe
And I wanna be there for you, for the rest of your days
But I know that you'll hurt if we keep on doing this
So I'm sorry to end this now, but I know that it's for the best
[Chorus]
Don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling, yeah
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move
And don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you
[Bridge]
I don't think you'll ever understand
I don't think you'll ever understand
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But darling, please don't be a fool
[Chorus]
Oh, don't be a fool, yeah
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move, yeah, oh
Just don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me, girl
'Cause you'll find a man who will stand by your side
And will be there for you
[Outro]
And don't be a fool
And wait on me, darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But don't be a fool
