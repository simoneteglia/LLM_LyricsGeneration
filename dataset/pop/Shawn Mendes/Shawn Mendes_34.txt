[Intro]
(Dream, dream, dream, dream)
[Verse 1]
Hello, hello, hello, can I hear an echo?
Purple, red, and yellow, I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about
You're asleep in London, I wish you were coming
Back home to me, darling, you're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just shut my eyes, all I have to do
[Chorus]
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
[Verse 2]
Hello, hello, hello, walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off the petals
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to me, yeah
I'm no good at waiting, all the separation
Feeling suffocated, I just need to breathe
And I'm starting to hate it
I can't wait to fall asleep
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
And all I have to do
[Chorus]
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
Dream, dream, dream, dream (I dream about you)
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
[Outro]
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
