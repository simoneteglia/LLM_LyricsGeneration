[Intro]
One, two, three, four...
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
[Verse 1]
Play the lotto, you might win it
It's like 25 to life so you bust outta prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot, you know you're gonna hit it
Something's in the air, something's in the air, woah
[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big
[Verse 2]
It's like that feeling when you're about to win the medal
And you worked so hard, that you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air, woah
[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big
[Bridge]
Woah, yeah, yeah
If we stomp our feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands, the walls will break
Yell so loud, won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening
Take this spark and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling higher
They can't tell us anything
'Cause something big is happening
[Chorus]
Something big, I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones
Like oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big is happening, woah
Oh, woah, woah, oh, woah
Something big, I feel it happening, oh
