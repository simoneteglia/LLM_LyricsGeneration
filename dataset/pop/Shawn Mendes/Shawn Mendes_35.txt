[Intro]
It's 305
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
[Verse 1]
You're my sunlight on a rainy day
Would take my heart with you if you walked away
I'm a mess right now, I'm a wreck right now
I'm waiting for the moment that you let me down
If you cut the cord, I don't know what I'd do
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute
I'm a mess right now, baby, help me out
I'm scared I'm gonna wake up and you'll let me down
[Pre-Chorus]
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night
[Chorus]
It's 305
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life
[Verse 2]
If there's a door to heaven, baby, you're the key
And if I had to beg, I'd be on my knees
Oh, please don't say anything has changed
You're the one I wanna wake up next to every day
[Pre-Chorus]
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night
[Chorus]
It's 305
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life
[Bridge]
I want to be with you
I want to fly with you
I want to be with you
[Chorus]
It's 305
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure
Baby, I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
(Please, don't change your mind darling)
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life (Oh, yeah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
