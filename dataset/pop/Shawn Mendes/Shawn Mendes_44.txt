[Intro]
I can't get much higher
[Verse 1]
New York in summertime
Get close with a bottle of wine
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Damn, flip it around, what a beautiful start
You and me on the top of the roof
Slow dance in the light of the moon, yeah
Never thought it would get this far
Never thought it would get this far, no
Never thought it would get this far
Wow, flip it around, what a beautiful start
[Chorus]
The drinks are gettin' better, the view is lookin' nice
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever, I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher
[Verse 2]
All eyes are lookin' at us
But I can't stop fallin' in love
Always been the one that I want, yeah
Always been the one that I want, yeah
Always been the one that I want
Wow, look at us now, damn what have I done?
I almost can't believe it
So please don't wake me if I'm dreamin'
Whenever I'm with you (Oh, yeah)
[Chorus]
The drinks are gettin' better, the view is lookin' nice
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever, I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher (Can't get much higher), I, I
No, I can't get much higher
[Bridge]
Say, say you won't let go
All I know, oh-oh
Is I can't get much higher
[Chorus]
I can't get much higher
The drinks are gettin' better (Better), the view is lookin' nice (Na, na)
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher (Can't get much higher), I, I
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever, I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together, no, I can't get much higher, I, I
No, I can't get much higher
