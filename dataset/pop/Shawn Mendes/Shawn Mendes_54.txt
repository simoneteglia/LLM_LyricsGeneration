[Verse 1]
Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say It
[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
[Verse 2]
I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before, don't even say It
[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
[Bridge]
Cause I've been living only for this moment
And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah
[Chorus]
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
Yeah baby, please no promises
Baby please no promises
Baby please
Baby please no promises
