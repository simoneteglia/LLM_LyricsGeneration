[Verse 1]
Are we gonna make it?
Is this gonna hurt?
Oh, we can try to sedate it
But that never works
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I start to imagine a world where we don't collide
It's making me sick, but we'll heal and the sun will rise
[Chorus]
If you tell me you're leaving, I'll make it easy
It'll be okay
If we can't stop the bleeding, we don't have to fix it
We don't have to stay
I will love you either way (Ooh-ooh)
It'll be o—, be okay (Ooh-ooh)
[Verse 2]
Oh, the future we dreamed of
Is fading to black, oh
And, oh, thеre's nothing more painful
Nothing more painful, oh-woah
[Pre-Chorus]
I start to imaginе a world where we don't collide
And it's making me sick, but we'll heal and the sun will rise
[Chorus]
If you tell me you're leaving, I'll make it easy
It'll be okay (It'll be okay)
And if we can't stop the bleeding, we don't have to fix it
We don't have to stay (Don't have to stay)
I will love you either way (Ooh-ooh)
It'll be o—, be okay (Ooh-ooh)
[Bridge]
I will love you either way
It might be so sweet
It might be so bitter
I will love you either way
It might be so sweet
It might be so bitter (Ooh-ooh)
[Outro]
Oh, if the future we've dreamed of is fading to black
I will love you either way
