[Verse 1]
Ooh, your body's like an ocean
I'm devoted to explore you
Ooh, what do you desire?
I'm inspired, I'll do it for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you draw a map for me?
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees
[Chorus]
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
[Verse 2]
Your imagination, now I'm fixated
And I'm dying to learn
Every inch of you, therе's something new
F'ing me up, I'm what you dеserve
[Pre-Chorus]
Just draw a map for me
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees
[Chorus]
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
[Post-Chorus]
How to love
How to love
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
[Bridge]
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
[Chorus]
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me how to love (Just teach me how to love)
Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you, and please you
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
[Post-Chorus]
How to love
How to love
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
How to love
How to love
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
[Outro]
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Babe, I won't stop 'til you feel the rush
Teach me, teach me, teach me how to love
