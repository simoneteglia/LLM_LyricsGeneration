[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nippin' at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, mm-mm
Helps to make the seasons bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Mendes,
Camila Cabello
&
Both
]
They know that (San—, san—),
Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna try
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
[Chorus: Camila Cabello,
Shawn Mendes
]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
[Bridge: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, ah-ooh
Ah
[Chorus: Shawn Mendes,
Camila Cabello
&
Both
]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from onе to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times,
many ways
Merry Christmas
to you
