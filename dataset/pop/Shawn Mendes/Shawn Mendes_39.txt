[Verse 1]
Re-rewind Friday night, never forget it
How you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine, know where I'm headed
Probably shoulda known
[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty, please forgive me, yeah"
Fooled me once, told you twice, "You're gonna regret it"
Now you're all alone, yeah
[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
[Verse 2]
Close your eyes, you can't hide, try to forget me
But I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets, you weren't ready
When you left me there
[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty, please forgive me, yeah"
Yeah, bet it hurts, it gets worse, you know nobody
Said it would be fair, oh
[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
[Bridge]
And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts 'cause
[Chorus]
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll help you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
[Outro]
And the aftertaste
