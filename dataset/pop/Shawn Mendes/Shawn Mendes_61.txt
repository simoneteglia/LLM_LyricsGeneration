[Verse 1]
So you leave tomorrow, just sleep the night
I promise I will make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow, just let me try
[Pre-Chorus]
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave
[Chorus]
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
[Verse 2]
Just one more night lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right, just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning and you'll be over this
Just one more night so I can forget
[Chorus]
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
[Bridge]
When you go, I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go, and you're miles down the road
I wake up wishing everything was just a dream
[Chorus]
Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on and stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone and I, I'm keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just act like you love me so I can go on
