[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I
[Pre-Chorus]
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'
And darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talkin', puttin' us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feelin'
[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'
[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I
[Pre-Chorus]
I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'
[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin' (Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'
[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again, yeah)
[Chorus]
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin' (Oh, yeah, we were dancin')
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancin' (Oh)
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied (Dancin' with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin' (Had a bad feelin')
But we were dancin'
[Outro]
Hands tied, hands tied
(Dancin')
