[Intro: Idris Elba &
James Corden
]
We can go drivin' in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London (
Oh, I'dâ€”
)
[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But somethin' happened, I heard him laughin'
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
[Pre-Chorus]
They say, "Home is where the heart is"
But that's not where mine lives
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni' and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
[Pre-Chorus]
They say, "Home is where the heart is"
But, God, I love the English
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you
[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you, oh, woah
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Soho, drinkin' in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you; ooh)
[Outro]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
I, oh, I, I fancy you, oh, woah-ah-ah (Ooh)
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh), wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you, ah-ah (Ooh)
