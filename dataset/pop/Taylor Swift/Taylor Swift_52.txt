[Intro: James Reynolds]
Gorgeous
[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
[Pre-Chorus]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not bein' mine
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (
Gorgeous
)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous
[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face;
Gorgeous
)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? You're gorgeous
[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Ugh) alone
Unless you wanna come along (Oh)
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous (Gorgeous)
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face;
Gorgeous
)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say) You're gorgeous
[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Turns back to sad)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (What I can't have)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You're gorgeous
