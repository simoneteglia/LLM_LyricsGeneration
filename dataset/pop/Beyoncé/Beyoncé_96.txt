[Chorus]
Ass getting bigger
Racks getting bigger
Cash getting larger
He thought he was loving me good, I told him, "Go harder"
She thought she was killing that shit, I told her, "Go harder"
Just look at this alkaline wrist 'cause I got that water
Ass getting thicker
Cash getting thicker (Thicker, thicker)
[Refrain]
That's that thick, that's that real shit
That's that jelly, baby, champagne and cherry, baby
That's that thick, that's that ball drop
That's that keep going, that's that never stop
[Verse 1]
That's that thick, that's that na-na, that oochie coochie, la-la
Yeah, this that Fiji agua, candy girl, piñata
Hit it in the car and take you back to the casa
Bet I got you rock now, that thick all over that yacht now
Uh, that's that
Freaknik
, that's that 1996
That's that moon Miami bass, twelve in the trunk, 808
Uh, that's that Castro, eat that shit like Maestro's
She say she on a diet, girl, you better not lose that ass, though
[Refrain]
That's that thick, that's that real shit
That's that jelly, nigga, that's that really, nigga
That's that thick, that's that ball drop
That's that keep going, that's that never stop
[Chorus]
Baby, that's that thick
That's that thick
Baby, that's that thick
That's that thick
Look at this shit
[Verse 2]
Ooh, that's that strawberry, that's that grape and cherry
Ooh
, this that Ginsu, cut that bitch like culinary
Ooh
, that's the bounce, spend my money, make it count
If it's lost, then it get found, just keep dropping that shit down
That's that summer, that's them Hummers
That's that, "Girl, give me your number"
That's that Jordy, that's that scholar, that I just got out of college
That's that "I don't do this usually," "I don't know what you do to me"
That "I don't do this usually," "I don't know what you do to me"
[Bridge]
Boy, you crazy, body mean, back it up like limousine
You gotta make a fold out to fit a magazine, right
Girl, look at your body, right
Boy, take this in slow, don't let go
Tell me how bad you been wanting it
And hurry up, quick, 'fore the moment ends
I like what I hear, might be sleeping in
Screaming, "Beyoncé," chocolate ounces
Sit on that, bounce it, bounce it
[Chorus]
Ass getting thicker
Cash getting thicker
Cash getting larger
He thought he was loving me good, I told him "Go harder" (Baby, that's that thick)
Thought she was killing that shit, I told her "Go harder" (That's that thick)
Look at this alkaline wrist 'cause I got that water (Baby, that's that thick)
Ass getting thicker (That's that thick)
Cash getting
Look at this shit
[Outro]
Oh, baby, come feel me
Oh, baby, I'm all up in your mind (It's all yours)
Come here, come here (Let's make love)
Make love to your mind (I'm all up in your mind)
Make love to you (Make love to your mind)
Close your eyes (I'm all up in your mind)
I'll breathe you in, I'll think your thoughts
I'll read your mind, I'll read your mind
