[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, got my fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
And every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up tell me how I'm looking, babe
[Breakdown]
Boy, this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
And tell me how it's looking, babe, looking, babe
[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mayne, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up," I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't never seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off your tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like-like liquor, like-like-like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like-like liquor, like-like-like liquor
