If you give this ass a squeeze (Give that ass a squeeze, baby)
It's pretty how I'll give you pleasure (Pretty, pretty hell)

Once you get me piped up, baby, I won't stop
Uh, I won't stop 'til you say you had enough
Ride it like a rodeo when I'm on top, uh, uh

You know it's Friday night and I'm ready to drive
Throw me them keys, baby, let's go
(It's Friday night and I'm ready to drive)
(Throw me them keys, baby, let's go)
We jump in the car, quarter tank of gas
World's at war, low on cash
(We jump in the car, quarter tank of gas)
(World's at war, low on cash)
I ain't never felt a feeling like this
You've been in love, but not like this
Sweet, honey, sin, taste it on your lips
Up and down on it, light switch, click
