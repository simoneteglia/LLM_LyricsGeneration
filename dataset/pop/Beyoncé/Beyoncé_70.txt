[Verse 1]
I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you (Yes)
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you (Yes)
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true (Yes)
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin' good (Oh yes)
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood (Oh yes)
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me, babe (Oh yes)
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
I wanna show you how much I hate being apart (Oh yes)
Wanna show you, show you, show you 'til you through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be
[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you (Oh-oh)
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you (Oh-oh)
Tonight, I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me
Ah, tonight, it's goin' down
I'll be rockin' on my babe, rockin', rockin' on my babe
Swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on my babe
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's 'bout to go down
[Verse 2]
You'll never need two
'Cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop-poppin' this thing back
Drop, drop, drop, drop-droppin' this thing back
This is for the time (Oh) you gave me flowers (Oh)
For the world (Oh) that is ours (Oh)
For the mula (Oh), for the power of love
And no, I won't never, ever, e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you-know-what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up
[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you (Oh-oh)
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you (Oh-oh)
Tonight, I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me
Ah, tonight, it's goin' down
I'll be rockin' on my babe, rockin', rockin' on my babe
I'll be swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on you, babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down
[Bridge]
I'ma take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines, boy, look into my eyes
While I'm grindin' on you (Oh), this is beyond sex (Oh)
I'm high on you (Oh), if it's real, then you know how I feel (Oh)
Rockin' on you, babe, rockin', rockin' on you, babe
Swirlin' on you, babe, in my mind, all I can think about
Is a frame for our future and the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last, oh, woah
[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you (Oh-oh)
Tonight, I'm gonna dance for you (Oh-oh)
Tonight, I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me
Ah, tonight, it's goin' down
I'll be rockin' on my babe, rockin', rockin' on my babe
I'll be swirlin' on my babe, swirlin', swirlin' on my babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
Watch me pop it, pop it (Oh)
P-p-p-p-pop it for you, baby (Oh)
Drop it, drop it, drop it (Oh)
Drop it for you, baby (Ooh)
Watch it, watch it (Oh)
Watch it, watch me roll it, baby (Ooh, oh)
Wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch me
Me pop it, pop it (Yes, oh)
P-p-pop it for you, baby (Oh)
Drop it, drop it (Yes)
Drop it, drop it for you, baby (Ah, ooh)
Watch it, watch it (Yes)
Watch it, watch me roll it, baby (Ooh, ooh)
Wanna make that body rock (Yes)
Sit back and watch (Ooh)
[Outro]
Yes (Ah, ah)
Yes (Ah, ah)
Yes (Ah, ah)
Oh yes (Ah)
Oh yes (Ah, ah)
Yes (Ah, ah)
Yes (Ah, ah)
Oh yes (Ah)
