[Intro]
This a reminder
[Verse 1]
Damn, I love the burning of the dagger
From the words that you say (Fuck, yeah)
Dancin' in the mirror, kiss my scars
Because I love what they made
(Ooh, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
She's a god (Ah-ooh), she's a hero (Ah-ooh)
She survived (Ah-ooh) all she been through (Ah-ooh, ooh)
Confident (Ah-ooh), damn, she lethal (Ah-ooh, ooh)
Might I suggest you don't fuck with my sis
(Ooh)
'Cause she comfortable
[Chorus]
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy, cozy
Comfortable in my skin
Feet up above your sins
I love myself, goddamn
Cozy, cozy
[Post-Chorus]
So cozy
I love me
They hate me
Because they want mе
(
I'm
dark brown, dark skin, light skin, beige
)
(
Fluorescеnt beige, bitch, I'm black
)
[Verse 2]
Been down, been up, been broke, broke down, bounced back
Been off,
been on
, been back, what you know about that?
Been the light, been dark, been the truth, been that King Bey energy
I been thick, been fine, still a ten, still here, that's all me
Black like love too deep
Dance to the soles of my feet
Green eyes envy me
Paint the world pussy pink
Blue like the soul I crowned
Purple drank and couture gowns
Gold fangs a shade God made
Blue, black, white, and brown
Paint the town red like cinnamon
Yellow diamonds, limoncello glycerine
Rainbow gelato in the streets
Renaissance, yachtin' in Capri
[Pre-Chorus]
You're a god (Ah-ooh, you're a god), you're a hero (Ah-ooh, you're a hero)
You survived (Ah-ooh) all you been through (Ah-ooh, ooh)
Confident (Ah-ooh), damn, you're lethal (Ah-ooh, ooh)
Might I suggest you don't fuck with my sis
(Ooh)
'Cause she comfortable
[Chorus]
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy, cozy
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
I love myself, goddamn
Cozy, cozy (Okay)
[Bridge]
I'm cozy (I'm cozy)
I'm juicy (I'm juicy)
You hate me (You hate me)
'Cause you want me ('Cause you want me)
I'm swaggy (I'm swaggy)
Effortlessly (Effortlessly)
That's how God made me (How God made me)
So, bitch, pay me (So pay me, ching-a-ling, ching, ching)
(
I'm black
)
(
I'm probably one of the blackest motherfuckers walking around here
)
Cozy
(
In this motherfucking place
)
(
I'm probably one of the blackest motherfuckers in this county
)
Cozy
(
I'm black like that
)
[Chorus]
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
I love myself, goddamn
Cozy, cozy
[Outro]
Unique
Unique is what you are
