[Intro]
Please do not be alarmed, remain calm
Do not attempt to leave the dance-floor
The DJ booth is conducting a troubleshoot test of the entire system
[Verse 1]
I'm one of one, I'm number one, I'm the only one
Don't even waste your time trying to compete with me (Don't do it)
No one else in this world can think like me (True)
I'm twisted (Twisted), I'll contradict it
Keep him addicted, lies on his lips, I lick it
[Pre-Chorus]
Unique
That's what you are
Stilеttos kicking vintage crystal off the bar
Category: bad bitch, I'm thе bar
Alien superstar
Whip, whip
[Chorus]
I'm too classy for this world, forever, I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched, I paid them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby
[Post-Chorus]
I'm (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
Ooh, I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby
I'm (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
Ooh, I'm stingy with my love (Unique)
[Verse 2]
Unicorn is the uniform you put on
Eyes on you when you perform
Eyes on I when I put on
Mastermind in haute couture
Label whores can't clock, I'm so obscure
(Unique)
Masterpiece, genius
Drip intravenous
Patty cake on that wrist
Tiffany Blue billboards over that ceiling (Unique)
We don't like plain
Always dreamed of paper planes
Mile-high when I rodeo
Then I come down and take off again (Unique)
You see pleasure in my glare
Look over my shoulder and you ain't scared
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow, hike it in the air
[Chorus]
I'm too classy for this world, forever, I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched, I paid them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby
[Post-Chorus]
I got pearls beneath my legs, my lips, my hands, my hips
(U-N-I-Q-U-E)
I got diamonds beneath my thighs where his ego will find bliss
Can't find an ocean deep that can compete with this cinnamon kiss (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
Fire beneath your feet, music when you speak, you're so unique
[Bridge]
(Unique)
That's what you are
Lingerie reflecting off the mirror on the bar
Category: sexy bitch, I'm the bar
Alien superstar
[Outro: Beyoncé &
Barbara Ann Teer
]
We dress a certain way
We walk a certain way
We talk a certain way
We, we paint a certain way
We, we make love a certain way, you know?
All of these things we do in a different
Unique, specific way that is personally ours
We just reaching out to the solar system
We flying over bullshit, we flying over
Supernatural love up in the air
I just talk my shit, Casanova
Superstar, supernova
Power, pull 'em in closer
If that's your man, then why he over here? (
Unique
