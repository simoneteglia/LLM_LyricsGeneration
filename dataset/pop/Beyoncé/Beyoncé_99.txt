Baby, come over (Baby, come over)
Come be alone with me tonight

Cuddled up on the couch
Motorboat, baby, spin around
Slow-mo comin' out my blouse
I want it right here, right now
[Verse 1]
There's nothin' that I want as much as I want you
A psychic hit me, told me we got shit to do
We ain't got time like we used to
But we still shine like we used to
And we still grind like we used to
And we cut ties when we need to
But I need more you on me and me on you, oh
[Refrain]
I can be the one that takes you there
And I need more nudity and ecstasy, oh
On this magic ride, woo, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh)
Baby, you can hit this, don't be scared
Baby, you can hit this, don't be scared
(
Yeah, yeah

It's only gonna get you high

Baby, come over
Come be alone with me tonight
All these emotions
It's washin' over me tonight, oh
[Chorus]
Right here (Right here), right now (Right now)
Iced up (Iced up), bite down (Bite down)
Baby, lock in (Lock in) right now (Right now)
I want it right here (Right here), right now (Right now)
Cuddled up (Cuddled up) on the couch (On the couch)
Motorboat (Motorboat), baby, swerve around (Swerve around)
Slow-mo (Slow-mo) comin' out my blouse (Out my blouse)
I want it right here (Right here), right now (Right now)
