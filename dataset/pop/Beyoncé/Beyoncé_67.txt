[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, I know it ain't the same
[Verse 1]
I wish I could believe you, then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now, my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied
[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment
[Verse 2]
Just can't seem to get over (Ooh)
The way you hurt me (Ooh)
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no (Mean a thing)
The very thing you gave to me (Ooh)
I thought I could forgive you (Ooh)
And I know you've changed (Ooh)
As much as I wanna trust you (Ooh)
I know it ain't the same (It ain't the same)
And it's all because you lied
[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time (Hard time, ooh)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (Ooh)
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this, ooh)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)
I may never understand why (Why)
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I (Ooh)
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this, ooh)
But I'm much too full of resentment (Ooh, you lied)
[Bridge]
I'll always remember feelin' (You lied)
Like I was no good (You lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could (Ooh)
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)
But that part of me I gave you (You lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied
[Chorus]
I only give you a hard time (Time)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend like)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment
[Outro]
I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', "What's up with B?"
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied, you lied)
And see she's had half of me (You lied)
How could you lie? (You lied)
