[Intro: Beyoncé &
JAY-Z

Bass (

808 (

)
Jay (
Uh-huh, you ready? Uh-huh
)
Let's go get 'em (
Uh-huh
)
Come on (
Come on
)
[Verse 1: JAY-Z &
Beyoncé
]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (
Boy, you hurtin' that
)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting, stand back
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm out of control (Ah)
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go, oh
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
[Verse 3: Beyonce]
I'm seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losin' it (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm out of control (Ah)
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go, oh, woah
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you (Oh, woah)
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you (Oh)
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one to one, nuttin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my (Oh)
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere (Ah)
Without thinking that you're there (Ah)
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Déjà Vu (Ah)
'Cause in my mind, I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care (Ah)
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu? (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm out of control (Ah)
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go, woah, oh
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
You know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
