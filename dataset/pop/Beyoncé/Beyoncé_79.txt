[Intro: BEAM]
On stage, rockin', I'm stir crazy
Cocoa flow like 1980's
Come, let's tell a drop lazy
None of that maybe
Energy (Ah)
Energy
Energy (On it)
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Just vibe
Votin' out 45, don't get outta line, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, pick a side
Only double lines we cross is dollar signs, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hol' up
Wait, I hear you just got paid, make it rain, energy
She more Cancún, he more Saint-Tropez
Big wave in the room, the crowd gon' move
Look around, everybody on mute
Look around, it's me and my crew
Big energy
[Chorus: BEAM]
He was on stop mode, got froze
Frozе front page Vogue, no pose
Chat too much, full clip unload
That's that Kodak еnergy
Energy
Energy
Energy
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Gold links, raw denim
You know that we do it grande
You know that I'm gon' be extra
When that camera go, "Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop"
Keep 'em waitin' like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot
"Ooh, la-la-la"
That's the way dem boys sound when I walk through the block, block, block
Then I uzi that doozie, shot, shot, shot
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
We was just chillin', mindin' our business
Poppin' our pain and champagne through the ceilin'
Sippin' it up, flickin' it up
All this good energy got you all in your feelings, feelings
I'm crazy, I'm swearin'
I'm darin', your man's starin'
I just entered the country with derringers
'Cause them Karens just turned into terrorists
[Chorus: BEAM,
Big Freedia
