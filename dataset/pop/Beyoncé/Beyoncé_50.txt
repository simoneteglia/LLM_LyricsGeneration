[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Sometimes, these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days, we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you're holdin' me tight, I feel alive
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Each day, I feel so blessed to be lookin' at you
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name
When I'm holdin' you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's, let's live it up
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
Blue
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
We gotta hold on
I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on
You've got a hold on, a hold on to me
We gotta hold on
I gotta hold on
You've got to hold on
You've got a hold on, a hold on me
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
