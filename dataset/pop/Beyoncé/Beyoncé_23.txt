[Verse 1]
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
[Verse 2]
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm screamin' out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen
[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
[Bridge]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't
[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete, oh-oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
[Outro]
My own
