[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes
[Chorus: Beyoncé,

Well, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
while listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Ah,

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Oh, barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favorite song
I have
faith in what I see
Now, I know I have met
an angel in person
And she
(

looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
, you look perfect tonight
