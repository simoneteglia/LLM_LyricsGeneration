[Verse 1]
She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There, but for the grace of God, oh, I
[Chorus]
I found Heaven on Earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
[Verse 2]
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down
[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on Earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria
[Bridge]
Sometimes, love can come and pass you by
While you're busy makin' plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands
Baby, you got to understand
[Chorus]
You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
