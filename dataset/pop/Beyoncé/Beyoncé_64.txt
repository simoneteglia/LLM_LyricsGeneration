[Intro]
I believe in, I believe in love
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Statues in the next room
Billions in escrow (
Ah
)
Bulletproof the whole thing
Ignore the dress code
Step into the ballroom
So hard to let go (
Ah
)
Things that never give life
I can see the echoes
[Verse 2: Travis Scott &
Beyoncé
]
Ridin' through the thunder
Tryna see the summer
It's the echoes that I wait for
It's the echoes that I'm made for
Recognize delresto
Recognize the let go
Breakin' through the echoes (
Made for
)
Breathin' through the echo (
Walk
)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's only echoes I escape for (Walk, walk)
Only echoes on the return (Walk, walk)
Walkin' on the numbers (Walk, walk)
Stay the night
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's the let go (Walk)
The let go (Walk)
The let go (Walk)
The let go (Walk)
That I wait for (Walk)
I'll wait for (Walk)
I'll wait for (Walk)
I'll wait for you (Walk)
[Verse 3: Justin Vernon &
Beyoncé
]
Watch you, watch you, watch you get the medical
Listen at your waist to stay hospitable
Infected with your vaccine, this ain't critical
Let me vibe with your green eyes (
—dom-dom-dom-dom
)
[Bridge: Travis Scott]
The starry nights, they start to fade (Come on)
At times, for miles I see your face, yeah
I drive, I drive alone, you wait
Your time, your time, your time, you take
You take
[Verse 4: Travis Scott]
Drivin' reckless through a storm and
It's you or breakfast in the mornin'
My nights is abnormal, advice ain't informal
I did try to warn you before they went and swarmed you
The height we made is paranormal
We shake and wake up the paranoia
Won't let it destroy you, won't let it annoy you
I'm tryin' to enjoy you in front of the foyer
[Verse 5: Beyoncé]
We can't seem to break through out the logical (Ah)
To see it in the day, you gotta free your soul (Breakin' through the echoes)
You wanna reign supreme and never let them go (Ah)
We filmin' live from the kingdom-dom-dom-dom
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Only echoes that I wait for (Ah)
Only echoes on the return
Walkin' on the numbers (Walk, walk)
I find (Walk, walk)
It's the echoes that I wait for (Walk, walk)
It's the echoes on the return (Walk, walk)
Stay the night
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's the let go (Walk)
The let go (Walk)
The let go (Walk)
The let go (Walk)
That I wait for (Walk)
I'll wait for (Walk)
I'll wait for (Walk)
I'll wait for you (Walk)
[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Hey, now, you will report to me
Hey, now, you will report to me
Hey, now
Hey, now, you will report to me (Hey, now, you will report to me)
Hey, now
Hey, now, you will report to me
