(How the fuck you figure I ain't a motherfucking pimp)
(When all these niggas be jocking me?)

(Pimping till the end, make that cheese, Nitty Green)
(Bitch please, motherfuckers ain't stopping me)
'Cause I'm in that ho
(Playing all these boys like toys, I ain't going)
You know all these songs sound good
(Never hoeing, see they niggas acting like they pimps)

From the top of the mornin', I shine (Ah-ooh)
Right through the blinds (Ah-ooh)
Touching everything in my plain view
And everything next to me gets lit up too (Ah)

I didn't want this power (

You know love is my weakness
Don't need drugs for some freak shit
I'm just high all the time, I'm out of my mind
I'm tweakin' (Tweakin', tweakin')

Off the deep end (Yeah)

I pull relief in (Yeah)
Bring that beat in (Yeah), now I can breathe again (Yeah)

That's how I ball
Cleanse me of my sins
My un-American life
