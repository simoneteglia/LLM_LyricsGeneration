[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Let the motherfuckin' beat build in this bitch
About that
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missin' you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, why is that?
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, missin' you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
It don't matter who you are, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
No matter who you love, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
I said I miss you, missin' you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?
[Outro: Beyoncé]
It don't matter who you are, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
No matter who you love, it is so simple
A feeling, but it's everything
