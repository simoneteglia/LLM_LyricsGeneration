[Verse 1]
I've been up, I've been down
Felt like I move mountains
Got friends that cried fountains, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm warnin' everybody
Soon as I get in this party
I'm gon' let go of this body
I'm gonna love on me
Nobody can judge me but me (Ooh)
I was born free (Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
I'll drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
I said now pop it like a thottie, pop it like a thottie (You bad)
Me say now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (You bad)
Church girls actin' loose, bad girls actin' snotty (You bad)
Let it go, girl (Let it go), let it out, girl (Let it out)
Twirl that ass like you came up out the South, girl (Ooh, ooh)
I said now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (You bad)
Bad girl actin' naughty, church girl, don't hurt nobody
[Post-Chorus]
You could be my daddy if you want to
You, you could be my daddy if you want to
You could get it tatted if you want to
You, you could get it tatted if you want to (She ain't tryna hurt nobody)
Put your lighters in the sky, get this motherfucker litty
She gon' shake that ass and them pretty tig ol' bitties (Huh)
So get your racks up (Word), get your math up (Huh)
I'ma back it up (Uh), back it, back it up (Back it, back it up)
I'ma buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it, actin' up (Actin' up)
I see them grey sweats (Grey sweats), I see a blank check
[Verse 2]
Mm, I'm finally on the other side
I finally found the urge to smile
Swimmin' through the oceans of tears we cried (Tears that we've cried)
You know you got church in the mornin' (The mornin')
But you doin' God's work, you goin' in (Ooh)
She ain't tryna hurt nobody (Ooh)
She just tryna do the best she can (Ooh)
Happy on her own (Ooh)
With her friends, without a man
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm warnin' everybody
Soon as I get in this party
I'm gon' let go of this body
I'm gonna love on me
Nobody can judge me but me
I was born free (Born free)
[Chorus]
I'll drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (Free)
I said now pop it like a thottie, pop it like a thottie (You bad, free)
Me say now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (You bad)
Church girls actin' loose, bad girls actin' snotty (You bad)
Let it go, girl (Let it go), let it out, girl (Let it out)
Twirl that ass like you came up out the South, girl (Ooh, ooh)
I said now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie (You bad)
Bad girls actin' raunchy, church girl, don't hurt nobody (Don't hurt nobody)
[Post-Chorus]
You could be my daddy if you want to (You bad)
You, you could get it tatted if you want to (You bad)
Put your lighters in the sky, get this motherfucker litty (You bad)
She gon' shake that ass and them pretty tig ol' bitties
So get your racks up (Ooh), get your math up (Ooh)
I'ma back it up (Back it up), back it, back it up (Back it, back it up)
I'ma buss it, buss it, buss it, buss it, actin' up (Actin' up)
I see them grey sweats (Ooh), I see a blank check (Ooh-ooh)
[Bridge]
Must be the cash 'cause it ain't your face
It must be the cash 'cause it ain't your face
Now do it, baby, stick it, baby, do it, baby, stick it, baby
Do it, baby, spin it, now spin it, baby, do it
Now spend that cash a little harder
And she might let you dive in the water
[Chorus]
Drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
Now, now, now drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
Oh-oh-oh, drop it like a thottie, drop it like a thottie
Good girls actin' bad, church girls don't hurt nobody
[Outro]
I ain't tryna hurt nobody (Mm)
Tryna bring the life up in your body (Mm)
