[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I remember being young and so brave (Boo)
I knew what I needed (Boo)
I was spendin' all my nights and days (Boo)
Laid back day dreamin' (Boo, day dreamin', dreamin', day dreamin')
Look at me, I'm a big girl now
Said I'm gon' do somethin' (Boo)
Told the world I would paint this town
Now betcha I run this (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I put it down like that (Yeah), d-down like that
And I'm makin' all these racks (Yeah), a-all these racks (Uh)
And I'm movin' round like that (Yeah), r-round like that (Ha)
When I do it, I don't look back, d-don't look back
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm a grown woman (Mm)
I can do whatever I want (Mm, hm, hm)
I'm a grown woman (Yeah, I'm a grown woman)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want, hey)
I can be bad if I want (Mhm)
I can do wrong if I want (Mhm)
I can live fast if I want (Mhm)
I can go slow all night long (Mhm)
I'm a grown woman (
What? Of course
, yeah)
I can do whatever I want (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
They love the way I walk (Boo)
'Cause I walk with a vengeance (Boo)
And they listen to me when I talk (Boo)
'Cause I ain't pretendin' (Boo)
It took a while, now I understand
Just where I'm goin' (Boo)
I know the world and I know who I am
It's 'bout time I show it (Ah)
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm a grown woman (I'm a grown woman, yeah)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want, mhm)
I'm a grown woman (I'm a grown woman, yeah)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want,
what? Of course
)
I can be bad if I want (Mhm)
I can say what I want (Mhm)
I can live fast if I want (Mhm)
I can go slow all night long (Mhm)
I'm a grown woman (
What? Of course
, yeah)
I can do whatever I want (I can do whatever I want, whatever it is)
[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm a grown woman (Grown)
And I know that I got it (Got it, got it)
I'm a grown woman (Grown)
Ain't got no room in my pockets (Ah)
I'm a grown woman (Grown)
Look down, got you so excited, haha (Ah)
I really wanna know if you got it like that
'Cause you got a cute face and that booty so fat
Go, girl (Go, girl), she got that bomb, that bomb
That girl (That girl) can get whatever she wants
That girl (That girl), she got that tight, that tight
Them boys (Them boys), they do whatever she likes
I'm a grown woman
