[Intro: Kilo Ali]
America, America has a problem
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
(Lama)
Tourbillion watcher, pgLang caller, 9-11 slider
Look at my garage, it's synced up
Get the genie out the bottle and point at any model
(Lama)
What, wait, what? Ayy, what?
Go, Stink, fuck it up, go, Stink, fuck it up
Go, Stink, that's what's up, go, Stink, I'm in love
Hey, boo-boo, too much complexity to learn me from Google
My mama told me that the money outgrew you
My horoscope said I'm really out my noodle
I'm troublin', I'm puzzlin', it's sudoku
Say Bey, yes, America got a problem
Geeked up, choosy love, well, they chose violence
Universal, please don't play possum
I'm a businеss man doin' as follows
Truthfully, I be lyin' in my rap song
'Cause I always fail to mention I'd slap homiе
His career didn't come with no life insurance
Hope his day one fans got some facts on him
I'm an honorary Beyhive, let's see why
Them diamonds don't be fly, they all CGI
You better get it off your chest like breast reduction
If she stressed over you, she stressed for nothin'
Hold up, wait a minute
Even AI gotta practice clonin' Kendrick
The double entendre, the encore remnants
I bop like ten men, the opps need ten men
Billboard, they know (Out for her, ride or else)
After Hov, rightfully so (Bust for else, not us)
Simmer down, I go, I go (Culture, you got us, you got us)
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Heard you got that D for me
Pray your love is deep for me
I'ma make you go weak for me
Make you wait a whole week for me (For me)
I see you watchin', fiendin'
I know you want it, schemin'
I know you need it, drug lord
You want it on you? Don't I know
You need love, I need some too
Do you want this like it wants you?
[Refrain: Beyoncé]
Know that booty gon' do what it want to
Can't hit it one time, multiple
I know you see these rack-rack-racks on me
Now come and get hi-i-i-i-i-igh
Twenty, forty, eighty out the trap, hit it with the rap
Put it on the map, then we right back
Call me when you wanna get hi-i-i-igh
Tony Montana with the racks
Ivy P on my bag, double G's on my dash
Nigga, I'm bad, I'm bad
Tell me when you wanna get hi-i-i-igh
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé &
Kendrick Lamar
]
Boy, you can't get no higher than this, no,
no
'Cause love don't get no higher than this, no,
no
, no,
no, no
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Grind (Grind)
Boy, you know I grind (Grind)
When I pull up these jeans, you're mine (When I pull up these jeans, you're mine)
You're mine (You're mine, you're mine)
When I step on the scene, they
Can't wait to back it up
Your ex-dealer dope, but it ain't crack enough
I'm supplying my man, I'm in demand soon as I land
Just know I roll with them goons (Goons)
In case you start acting familiar
This kind of love, big business
Whole slab, I kill for
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé &
Kendrick Lamar
]
Boy, you can't get no higher than this, no (Higher)
'Cause love don't get no higher than this, no,
no
, no,
no, no
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Grind (Grind)
Boy, you know I grind (Grind)
When I pull up these jeans, you're mine (When I pull up these jeans, you're mine)
You're mine (You're mine, you're mine)
When I step on the scene, they
Can't wait to back it up
Your ex-dealer dope, but it ain't crack enough
I'm supplying my man, I'm in demand soon as I land
Just know I roll with them goons (Goons)
In case you start acting familiar
This kind of love, big business
Whole slab, I kill for
