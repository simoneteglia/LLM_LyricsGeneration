[Intro]
Pa-pa-pa-da, pa-pa-pa-da
Pa-pa-pa-da, pa-pa-pa-da
Pa-pa-pa-da, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa-pa
Bring the beat in
[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away
[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smilin' out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)
Oh, woah
Nothin's perfect, but it's worth it
After fightin' through my tears
And finally, you put me first
[Chorus]
Baby, it's you (Oh)
You're the one I love (I love)
You're the one I need (I need)
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call (Always calls)
When I need, you make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh), come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top, my love on top
[Verse 2]
Baby, baby
I can feel the wind whippin' past my face
As we dance the night away (Away)
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again
[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smilin' out from ear to ear (They say love hurts)
But I know (It's gonna take a little work)
Oh, woah
Nothin's perfect, but it's worth it
After fightin' through my tears
And finally, you put me first
[Chorus]
Baby, it's you (Love)
You're the one I love (I love)
You're the one I need (I need)
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call (Always calls)
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh), come on, baby
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top, my love on top
[Chorus]
Baby, it's you (Oh)
You're the one I love (I love)
You're the one I need (I need)
You're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls (Always calls)
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, you're the one that I love (Love)
Baby, you're all I need (Need)
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all (Your all)
You're the one I always call (Always calls)
When I need you, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Oh, baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls (Calls)
When I need you, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love (I love)
Baby, you're the one that I need (Need)
You're the only one I see (See)
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all (Ooh)
You're the one that always calls (Calls)
When I need you, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
