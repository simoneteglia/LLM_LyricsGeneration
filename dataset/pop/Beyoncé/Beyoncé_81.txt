[Intro]
Aw, baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made, but me, myself?
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
And, uh, what's more special than you?
You feel me?
[Verse 1]
It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
[Chorus]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up (Haha)
[Verse 2]
Usually I'm humble, right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know, I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs, matter of fact, it's my smile
Or maybe my eyes? Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda somethin' like me (Like me)
[Chorus]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
[Bridge]
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
[Chorus]
It's too big (Big), it's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong), it won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much), it's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego (Ego)
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
[Outro]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Oh, woah, oh
Oh
Oh, ooh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh
