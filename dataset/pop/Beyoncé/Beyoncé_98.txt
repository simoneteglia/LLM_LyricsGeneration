Move out the way

It's a home run when the team touch base

Skrrt off, make room

Everybody around me (Yeah)

Pick it up like you found it (Found it)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Me and my girlfriends came out to play (Play)
Fireworks and champagne, Chantilly Lace
Broken glass in the disco, sex on the brain (Ah)
Watch my reflection, **** out my face

[Interlude: Tems]
Who this girl in the back of the room?
Who this girl in the back of the room?
Who this girl in the back of the room?
It's the groove, it's the Yoncé groove
Who this girl in the back of the room?
Who this girl in the back of the room?
It's the groove, it's the Yoncé groove
It's a party in the hotel room
[Bridge: Beyoncé,

Find me, I don't need to call him
I don't need no phone, yeah
I don't need to fall, yeah
You know me, I'm vibin'
You and me's a vibe, yeah
Always catchin' vibe, eh
Give me a little fire
Give me a little flame, yeah
Give me a relight and wine
I don't want to contemplate
Give me a little fire
Give me a relight and wine
I want to make you shine (
Queen come through

This is how I move, this is how I move
This is why I live, sweet moments like this
This is how we groove, this is how we kiss
(
Queen come through, queen come through
)
This is how I move, this is how I move
This is how we live, sweet moments like this
This is how we groove, this is how we kiss (
Wow
