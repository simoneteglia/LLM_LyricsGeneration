[Chorus: Nija &
Beyoncé

They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow (
Boma, boma yé
)
They feel a way, oh wow (
Boma, boma yé
)
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow (
Boma, boma yé

They feel a way, oh wow (
Boma, boma yé

[Verse 1: Tierra Whack]
I was always in the lead
Who you wanna be? I'm who they wanna be
B-E-A-U-T-Y-E, never seen so much rage from a queen
Rage from a queen, queen so strong, thought she was a machine
Girl of your dreams, Synclaire, Regine
Turned to the max, can't forget Maxine
Refer to me as a goddess, I'm tired of being modest
A hundred degrees, the hottest, if we being honest
Ebony and ebonics, black people win
They say we bein' demonic, angel in disguise
I hate I have to disguise it, why you gotta despise it?
Rich in the mind, that's why I'm making deposits
Carry all the power, it's time to realize it
(They'll never, ever take my power)
[Chorus: Nija &
Beyonce
]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow
They feel a way, oh wow
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way (Hold up), oh wow (
Boma, boma yé
, wow, wow, wow)
They feel a way (Woo), oh wow (
Boma, boma yé
, wow, wow, wow)
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
This that rhythm, this that lightning
This that burn, this ain't no perm
This that nappy, this that herb
This that kinfolk, this that skinfolk
This that war, this that bloodline
On the frontline, ready for war
Where you gon' run?
I'ma get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh yeah, get loose, get loose, get low, get low
Oh-oh-oh, gotta protect my grace
Keep it locked in the safe
Don't make me get back to my ways
My power, they'll never take
[Chorus: Nija,
Nija & Beyoncé
]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power
, my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow (Wow, wow, wow, wow)
They feel a way (Woo), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They'll never take my power
, my power, my power
They'll never take my power
(Power), my power, my power
They feel a way, oh wow (Wow, wow)
They feel a way, oh wow (Wow, wow)
[Verse 3: Busiswa]
Woza
Vumani bo! (Siyavuma!)
Selingenile ikumkani
Ningangabazi amandla am
Ngizogobisa abanenkani
Thulani bo! (Seng'hleli)
Selivukile idimoni lami
Nibabuzile abaziyo ngami
There will be peace when I'm done
Jongani bo (Siyabona)
Ndim' ne-Skeem Sami
Sizilethile izikhali
La amagwala awahlangani
Hlalani bo! (Ibamb'umthetho)
Niyayibon' iyinkinga lento
Soyilungisa, themba mina
Qoqa amaqhawe soyiqeda manje!
[Chorus: Nija]
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They'll never take my power, my power, my power
They'll never take my power, my power, my power (Ayy)
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)
They feel a way (Ayy), oh wow (Wow, wow)
