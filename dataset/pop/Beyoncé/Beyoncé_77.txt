[Intro]
I love you
I love you
I love you
[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you, you are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side (You weren't by my side)
You're my relation, in connection to the sun (Connection to the sun)
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome (I can't overcome)
You are my raindrops, I am the seed (I am the seed)
With you and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully (Grow so beautifully)
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl (Proud to be your girl)
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world
[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me
'Cause I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me
[Verse 2]
And I know you love me, love me for who I am (Love me for who I am)
'
Cause years before I became who I am, baby, you were my man (Baby, you were my man)
I know it ain't easy, easy lovin' me (Easy lovin' me)
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me (From you to me)
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child (I see myself having your child)
I see myself being your wife and I see my whole future in your eyes (Future in your eyes)
The thought of all my love for you sometimes makes me wanna cry (Sometimes makes me cry)
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side
[Chorus]
I am in love with you (I am in love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me (Do this thing)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (Love with you), I'll never leave
Just, just keep lovin' me (I love you) the way I love you, lovin' me
'Cause I am in love with you (I'm so in love), you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you, I'll never leave (No, no, no, no)
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me (Lovin' me)
[Bridge]
Every time I see your face (Every time I see your face)
My heart smiles (My heart smiles)
Every time, it feels so good (Every time, it feels so good)
It hurts sometimes (It hurts sometimes)
Created in this world to love
To hold, to feel
To breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love
[Chorus]
I am in love with you (In love), you set me free (Yeah)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
(Can't do this thing, yeah)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave
(I love you, I love you, I love you, I'll never leave)
Just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me
(Keep lovin' me, oh no)
'Cause I am in love with you (In love), you set me free
(I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you)
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
(I cannot do it, I cannot do anything without you in my life)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you (In love), I'll never leave (Holdin' me, kissin' me, lovin' me)
Just keep lovin' me the way I love you, lovin' me
[Outro]

Oh, I love you (I love you)
I love you, love you, love you, love you, I love you (I love you)

Oh, yes (I love you, love you, love you, I love you)
