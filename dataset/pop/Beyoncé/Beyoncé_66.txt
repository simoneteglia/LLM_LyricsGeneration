[Intro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go
[Chorus: Beyoncé,
Beyoncé, André 3000 & Consequence
]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause
we like to party
[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé,
André 3000 & Consequence
]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, we like to party
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, party, party, party
)
'Cause we like to party, ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, we like to party
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, party, party
)
'Cause we like to party
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Your touch is drivin' me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down, with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they talkin' tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party
[Verse 3: André 3000]
Set the scene, three thousand degrees
I ain't worried about them, **** **** over there, but they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter and another homeboy there, **** named Cheese
**** with me, baby, I'll make it milk 'til it drip down your knees
Spit this **** for real-o, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them, they never forgot and nothin' else really mean nothin' to me
I ain't studyin' the beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you **** with me? Move on, ain't nothin' to see
Sh, always somethin' to saw, I'm the raw, off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the minute
They fell in love with rap, black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah
[Chorus: Beyoncé,
Beyoncé, André 3000 & Consequence
]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause
we like to party
[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé,
André 3000 & Consequence
]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, we like to party
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, party, party, party
)
'Cause we like to party, ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, we like to party
)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(
I don't know what y'all do, but we like to party, party, party, party
)
'Cause we like to party
[Outro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl, and your friends bad too, ooh
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too, ooh
You got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu, ooh
