Brown skin girl
Your skin just like pearls
The best thing in the world
I'd never trade you for anybody else, singin'
Brown skin girl
Your skin just like pearls
The best thing in the world
I'd never trade you for anybody else, singin'
[Verse 1: Wizkid]
She said she really grew up poor like me
Don't believe in nothin' but the Almighty
Just a likkle jeans and a pure white tee
She never dream for ever be nobody wifey, yeah
She Wilhelmina pretty, but she heart is a maze
Play ya like a villain 'cause she caught in a wave
Tonight, I am walkin' away
Nine-to-five mind, on the grind, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid]
Tonight, I might fall in love
Dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calming down
Can't let no one come control me
Keep dancing and call it love
She fights it, but falling slowly
If ever you are in doubt
Remember what Mama told me
[Chorus: Wizkid]
Brown skin girl
Ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world
I'd never trade you for anybody else, say
Brown skin girl
Ya skin just like pearls
The best thing inna di world
I'd never trade you for anybody else, say
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Pose like a trophy when Naomi's walkin'
She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin
Pretty like Lupita when the cameras close in
Drip broke the levee when my Kellys roll in
I think tonight, she might braid her braids
Melanin too dark to throw her shade (Shade)
She minds her business and wines her waist
Gold like 24K, okay
[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé]
Tonight, I might fall in love
Dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calming down
Can't let no one come control me
Keep dancing and call it love
She fights it, but falling slowly
If ever you are in doubt
Remember what Mama told me
[Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé,

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Oh, have you looked in the mirror lately? (Lately)
Wish you could trade eyes with me 'cause (Oh)
There's complexities in complexion
But your skin, it glow like diamonds
Pigment like the earth, you be giving birth
To everything alive, baby, know your worth
I love everything about you, from your nappy curls
To every single curve, your body natural
Same skin that was broken
Be the same skin takin' over
Most things out of focus view
But when you're in the room, they notice you (Notice you)
'Cause you're beautiful
Yeah, you're beautiful
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Them men, them gon' fall in love (In love)
With you and all of your glory (Glory)
Your skin is not only dark (Only)
It shines and it tells your story (Story)
Keep dancin', they can't control you (Ahh)
They watchin', they all adore you
If ever you are in doubt
Remember what Mama told you
[Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé,
