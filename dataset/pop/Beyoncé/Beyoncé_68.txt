[Intro]
Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(
Uishi kwa uishi kwa
)
Uishi kwa muda mrefu mfalme
(
Uishi kwa, uishi kwa
)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, and the wind is talkin'
Yeah, yeah, for the very first time
With a melody that pulls you towards it
Paintin' pictures of paradise
[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Watch the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, woah
[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, and the water's crashin'
Trying to keep your head up high
While you're trembling, that's when the magic happens
And the stars gather by, by your side
[Pre-Chorus]
Sayin' rise up
To the light in the sky, yeah
Let the light lift your heart up
Burn your flame through the night, yeah
[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-ight
[Bridge]
So go into that far off land
And be one with the Great I Am, I Am
A boy becomes a man, woah
[Chorus]
Spirit, watch the heavens open (Open)
Yeah
Spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah
Spirit, yeah, watch the heavens open, open
Yeah
Spirit, spirit, can you hear it callin'? (Callin')
Yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Your destiny is comin' close
Stand up and fi-i-i-ight
[Outro]
So go into a far off land
And be one with the Great I Am
