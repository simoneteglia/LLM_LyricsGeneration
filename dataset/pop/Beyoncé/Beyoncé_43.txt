[Part 1: Bow Down]
[Intro]
I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I'm coming down
Coming down dripping candy on the ground
[Verse]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
[Bridge]
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches
H-town vicious, H-H-town vicious
I'm so crown, bow bow down bitches
[Outro]
I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I'm coming down
Coming down dripping candy on the ground
[Part 2: I Been On]
[Chorus]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
'Cause I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
[Verse]
Rollin' high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what's good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talkin' lip
I told my crew to smack that trick
Smack that trick, smack that trick
Guess what they did, smacked that trick
Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the number one chick, I don't need no hype
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
The capital B means I'm 'bout that life
[Chorus]
I been on, I been on, I been on
Tell me, who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off
'Cause I been on
[Outro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha
I remember my baby hair with my dookie braids
Frenchy's
,
Boudin in the parking lot
Shout out to Willie D
I was in that Willie D video when I was about fourteen, lookin' crazy
Shout out Pimp C
You know we used to sneak and listen to that UGK
Didn't **** your girl but your sister was alright, damn
Ah-ah in ya homeboy's Caddy last night, man, ha-ha-ha-ha
Hol' up, Texas trill
H-Town goin' down, man
