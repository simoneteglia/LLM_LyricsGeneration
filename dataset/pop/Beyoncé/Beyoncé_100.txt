[Chorus]
You know I hate sleepin' alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
[Post-Chorus]
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat
I think it's time to go, let's go, little kitty cat
He don't want no mo', let's go, little kitty cat
Quite frankly, no more givin' it, I'm not feelin' it
[Verse 1]
It's like we at two places, but different paces
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted
Did you forget where your heart lives?
[Pre-Chorus]
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Actin' like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty
[Chorus]
You know I hate sleepin' alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
[Post-Chorus]
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat
I think it's time to go, let's go, little kitty cat
He don't want no mo', let's go, little kitty cat
Quite frankly, no more givin' it, I'm not feelin' it
(Let me show you how to get there, yeah)
[Verse 2]
Take a left to compassion (Lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sun right there
Affection (You're in the wrong direction)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care
[Pre-Chorus]
What about my body, body? (Body)
You don't want my body, body (Body, oh)
Actin' like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty
[Chorus]
You know I hate sleepin' alone (Ooh)
But you said that you would soon be home (You said you would soon be home)
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it (Ooh, oh, ah, oh)
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
And you actin' like it's all o' that (Your sex ain't all that)
I'm not feeling it, I'm not feeling it (Let's go)
[Post-Chorus]
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat
I think it's time to go, let's go, little kitty cat
He don't want no mo', let's go, little kitty cat
Quite frankly, no more givin' it, I'm not feelin' it
[Verse 3]
I'm takin' back the things I got from you, you
And that includes my sweet little nookie too, too (Let's go)
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat (Kitty cat)
He don't want you anymore, no (Uh, uh, uh, let's go)
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat (Kitty cat)
He don't want you anymore, no (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Bridge]
Got diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records
Since sixteen, I was comin' down, ridin' Lexus
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie, Craig
What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you'd rather go and party?
What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
Actin' like I'm nobody, you gon' make me call somebody
[Outro]
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat
I think it's time to go, let's go, little kitty cat
He ain't want no mo', let's go, little kitty cat
No mo' getting' it, I'm not feelin' it
