[Verse 1: Madonna]
I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly game
Some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now, I find
I've changed my mind
[Sample: Jesse Pearson]

[Chorus: Madonna]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I traveled 'round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone
I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy
[Chorus: Madonna]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
[Bridge: Madonna]
Mmm, ooh, mmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No Ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmm, mmm
[Chorus: Madonna]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
, mmm
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
[Sample: Jesse Pearson]

[Outro: Madonna]
Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion
