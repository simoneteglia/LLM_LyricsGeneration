[Intro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me
[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why
[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
The deeper I go
[Verse 2]
"All is fair in love," she said
"Think with your heart, not with your head"
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me
[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why
[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)
And my mama made me learn this song
(You're gonna bring your love to me, I'm gonna get you)
That's why
[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know
[Outro]
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
You've got to just let your body move to the music
You've got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do
