[Intro: Sam Smith &
Madonna
]
Vulgar
Mm
Speak, bitch, and say our fucking names
It's Sam and Madonna
[Verse 1: Sam Smith,
Sam Smith & Madonna
]
Look like I'm dressed to kill, love how I make me feel
All black in stripper heels, mood like Madonna
Rich like I'm in the Louvre, got nothin' left to prove
You know you're beautiful when they call you vulgar
I do what I wanna, I go when I gotta
I'm sexy, I'm free and I
feel
Uh
[Chorus: Sam Smith,
Sam Smith & Madonna
]
Vulgar
Vulgar
Vulgar
Vulgar
Vulgar
[Verse 2: Madonna,
Sam Smith & Madonna
]
Let's get into the groove, you know just what to do
Boy, get down on your knees 'cause I am Madonna
If you fuck with Sam tonight, you're fucking with me
So watch what you say or I'll split your banana
We do what we wanna, we say what we gotta
We're sexy and free and we feel
Uh
[Chorus: Sam Smith & Madonna]
Vulgar
Vulgar
Vulgar
Vulgar
Vulgar
[Bridge: Sam Smith & Madonna,
Sam Smith
,
Madonna
]
Vulgar is beautiful, filthy, and gorgeous
Vulgar will make you dance, don't need a chorus
Say we're ridiculous, we'll just go harder
Mad and meticulous,
Sam and
Madonna
[Interlude: Sam Smith]
Speak, bitch, and say our fucking names
Speak, bitch, and say our fucking names
Speak, bitch, and say our fucking names
[Outro: Madonna &
Sam Smith
]
Do you know how to spell my name?
B-I-T-C-H
Go fuck yourself
You heard me, bitch
Say our fucking names
Speak, bitch, and say our fucking names
