[Intro: Michelle Visage]
Madonna X is a lover
Madonna X is a mystery
Madonna X is an Uber driver
But, sometimes she drives for Lyft too
[Verse 1: Jan]
In 1984, on American Bandstand
Dick Clark asked me: "
Madonna, what's next?
"
I wanna (Rule the world)
I wanna rule the world (Rule the world)
Crucifix, don't shave my pits (Rule the world)
I want to rule the world  (Rule the world)
Gonna grab it by the balls
Shared a name with my mother
She died when I was five years old
Turn the hurt around
Knew I was destined, for something more
With a name like Madonna
I could be a saint or a sinner
So, I started dancing
Won't stop 'til I'm a winner (Rule the world)
I wanna rule the world (Rule the world)
I'm not your average girl (Rule the world)
I wanna rule the world (Rule the world)
[Verse 2: Jackie Cox]
(Hello Ru, this is Madonna, call me in Miami)
I know exactly what I want
The groove is calling out to me
So, I became my own icon
I own MTV
Rolling around in a wedding gown
A dirty blonde with a sexy mole
Just like Marilyn
I had material goals (Ah, ah)
'Cause I'm a boy toy, baby
And all the little girls dress like me
'Cause I'm a boy toy, baby
And all the others are just wannabes
I'm a boy toy and I ain't gonna stop
I'm a boy toy, call me a boy toy
Because I'm the one on top (Call me a boy toy)
I'm a boy toy
[Verse 3: Gigi Goode]
My next album went platinum fast
And so did I
Critics don't know what to make of me
Am I real art or publicity?
My music videos stir up controversy
Haters criticize my
blond ambition
Double standard, is it 'cause I'm a woman?
I'm gonna
express myself
And you'll pay more than attention (I want more than attention)
(Unapologetic) Defying old taboos
(Unapologetic) 'Cause sex is power too
Making art isn't easy
But that's what I do it (So you can get into it)
(Unapologetic) Did I make you stare?
(Unapologetic) Now kiss my derriere
Making art isn't easy
And I've got the scars to prove it
So you can get into it
[Verse 4: Brita]
Hello, fellas!
Love who you love
You know there's more than one way to play
Bullet bras are the way to go far
Thank you,
Jean Paul Gaultier
Pinstripe suits can be subversive
But listen to what I say
Leading men and Latin studs
I love them like nobody else
But gay men are the ones who intrigue me
I should have been born one myself
God bless the gays (God bless the gays)
LGBT
God bless the gays (God bless the gays)
GMHC
More than an advocate, we went through serious shit
Our bond got stronger and stronger
Like a prayer does a mourner (Like a prayer)
God bless the gays (God bless the gays)
God bless the children
God bless the gays
God bless the gays
[Verse 5: Jaida Essence Hall]
So, after dressing you up in my love
There was only one thing left to do
Take it all off
I made a video in Paris (Ooh la la)
It was too hot for MTV (Ouch)
So it became the first VHS single (Kerching)
Now, when pop stars shake their cakes on Instagram
I say: "You're welcome"
Posing, disrobing, opposing, for you
As I (Must define my brand)
Girls and boys kissing, censors hissing
As I (Must define my brand)
Whips, bare nips, not just the tips
As I (Must define my brand)
I'm seductive, not reductive
I'm erotic, you're neurotic
'Cause I (Must define my brand)
Because I'm what?
Whipsmart
[Verse 6: Sherry Pie]
I never wanted to be an actress
I thought I'd stick to music
But I was
desperately seeking something
And then
Sean gave me Shanghai Surprise
, and a ring
Some people wondered
"Who's that girl?"
I was just breathless
over
Dick (Tracy)
Though I knew that I was in
a league of my own
(A league of her own)
I was born to play Eva
, Yes voice lessons!
A golden globe for all the haters
And though my acting days are mostly swept away
I do what I wanna, cause bitch, I'm Madonna
But what I really want to do is direct
Cut, print, moving on
[Verse 7: Crystal Methyd]
There comes a time in an artist's career (-reer, -reer, -reer)
When she decides to seek God
And put it in her songs (Songs, songs, songs)
I took myself first-class on a journey (-ney, -ney, -ney)
To find a higher power and live my life in awe
I'm alive (Don't care, don't care)
I'm alive (Don't come too near)
I'm alive (Don't care, don't care)
I'm alive
Hippy-dippy, trippy song (I'm alive)
A Kabbalah sing-along (I'm alive)
Won a Grammy for this song
(-ong, -ong, -ong, -ong, -ong, -ong)
You go girl
Yas, God!
[Verse 8: Widow Von'Du]
Hey, lady pop stars, all hail the queen
Welcome to my Fempire
After two decades in the biz
Now I can do whatever
Dress up like a pimp
Talk like a Brit
Things that used to get me banned
Are emulated across the land
Blaze new trails for others like me
You're welcome, Gwen Stefani
All the girls go Gaga for my grills
While I make it rain with my bills
My power isn't fake
And in front of Timberlake
I kissed Britney and Christina
And I liked it, Katy Perry
Hey, lady pop stars, all hail the queen
Welcome to my Fempire
[Verse 9: Heidi N Closet]
(I'm still in the groove, yeah)
Oh, bitch, I got this
(Redefining the moves, yeah)
Don't be an ageist
I did pilates with some hotties in the aughts
Then took to the dance floor
Wearing pink for my confessions
Got
hung up
,
Super Bowl
,
hard candy
and
Malawi
Said bye to
Guy,
thank God I'm single and not sorry
(My eighties ladies) Have all come and gone
(Whitney, George, MJ) Moonwalked on
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I still grow 'cause I'm M-A-D-O-N-N-A, bitch
Sixty years and I keep topping
Ageist if you think I'm stopping
Classic looks but kids keep mocking
(I'm M-A-D-O-N-N-A, bitch)
Beyoncé, Gaga, Ariana
Girls, I still be here mañana
Sexy, not afraid to flaunt it
(I'm M-A-D-O-N-N-A, bitch)
Yes, I'm still Madonna
Fuck your sexist drama
When you hate it's just kablama
Don't preach 'cause I'm your mama
I'm M-A-D-O-N-N-A, bitch
(Compose, -pose, -pose)
I think the most controversial thing I have ever done
Is to stick around
[Outro: All]
Compose (-pose, -pose)
Okay, here we go
All Madonnas,
spit a flow
Compose (-pose, -pose)
Like a Virgin, Like a Prayer
Cherish
, True Blue,
Truth or Dare
Dick Tracy,
Drowned World Tour
Live to Tell, now Who's that Girl?
Express yourself, Material Girl
You got
4 Minutes to Save the World
Open Your Heart, don't get Hung Up
Papa, Don't Preach, I'm Burning Up
Living for Love, I'm Madame X
Into the Groove, a book called Sex
I'll Remember, so Don't Tell Me
Physical Attraction, for Dear Jessie
Beautiful Stranger, Crazy for You
Sorry, Hydrangea, I still loathe you
Girl Gone Wild, Rebel Heart
Causing a Commotion
and that's just the start
Compose (-pose, -pose)
From Holiday to Medellin
When it comes to pop, I'm still your queen
I'm M-A-D-O-N-N-A, bitch!
