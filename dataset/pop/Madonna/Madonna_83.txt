[Verse 1]
When I was very young
Nothing really mattered to me
But making myself happy
I was the only one
Now that I am grown
Everything's changed
I'll never be the same
Because of you
[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
[Verse 2]
Looking at my life
It's very clear to me
I lived so selfishly
I was the only one
I realize
That nobody wins
Something is ending
And something begins
[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
[Bridge]
Nothing takes the past away
Like the future
Nothing makes the darkness go
Like the light
You're shelter from the storm
Give me comfort in your arms
[Chorus]
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
Everything I give you
All comes back to me
Nothing really matters
Love is all we need
