[Verse 1]
Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go
[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me
[Chorus]
Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
[Verse 2]
You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along what I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else
[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me
[Chorus]
Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand how it could be
Until you shared your secret with me
[Chorus]
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm, something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
[Outro]
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret
Mmm-mmm, my baby's got a secret for me
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
