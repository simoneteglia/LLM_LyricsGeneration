[Verse 1]
Something in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playing with my heart
Finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around
[Pre-Chorus]
Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me
[Chorus]
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)
[Post-Chorus]
Keep on pushing me, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
[Verse 2]
Something in your eyes is making such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
But then you let me down
When I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop driving me away
I just wanna stay
There's something I just got to say
[Pre-Chorus]
Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me
[Chorus]
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)
[Post-Chorus]
Keep on pushing me, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushing my love over the borderline
[Verse 3]
Look what your love has done to me
C'mon, baby, set me free
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)
You cause me so much pain
I think I'm going insane
What does it take to make you see?
You just keep on pushing my love
Over the borderline
[Outro]
Keep pushing me
Keep pushing me
Keep pushing my love
(Keep on pushing my love over the borderline, borderline)
C'mon, baby
C'mon, darling, yeah
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
