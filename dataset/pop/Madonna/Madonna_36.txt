[Verse 1: BØRNS,

Ayy, ayy
Someone must have sent me to heaven (
ahh
)
Blue madonna down by the pool
Just want to make her feel like a virgin
A version of herself that she once knew
Ooh
[Verse 2: BØRNS]
But I just wanna watch her
Like a candle in the moonlight
Hotter than a blueberry flame
Whats her name?
Smoke rising in the distance
She glides in a swan dive
Cooler than a strawberry shake
[Verse 3: BØRNS,

All the rivers run back into the sea (
baby, baby
)
But baby don’t you leave (
baby, don't you leave
)
I only want you
running back to me
[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Blue madonna in my head now
Blue madonna in my bed now
Blue madonna cherry red now
In this light
Blue madonna in my head now
Blue madonna in my bed now
Blue madonna cherry red now
Tonight, tonight
