[Verse 1]
It's funny that way
You can get used to the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me
[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
[Verse 2]
Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father, I have sinned
[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
[Bridge]
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away?
[Verse 3]
Maybe someday
When I look back, I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too
[Chorus]
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you
I never thought I would
You can't make me cry
You once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
