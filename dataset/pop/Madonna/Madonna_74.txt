[Verse 1]
You must be my Lucky Star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you, and I start to glow
And I need your light and baby, you know
[Chorus]
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight (Starbright)
Make everything all right
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight (Starbright), yeah
[Verse 2]
You must be my Lucky Star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost, you'll be my guide
I just turn around, and you're by my side
[Chorus]
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight (Starbright)
Make everything all right
Starlight, starbright
First star I see tonight
Starlight (Starbright), yeah
[Bridge]
C'mon, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right
Mmm, c'mon, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right

You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far
You may be my Lucky Star, but I'm the luckiest by far
