[Verse 1]
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
[Pre-Chorus]
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please
[Chorus]
Papa, don't preach
,
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach
, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mm
[Verse 2]
He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice
[Pre-Chorus]
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now
Is some good advice, please
[Chorus]
Papa, don't preach
,
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach
, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh
[Bridge]
Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love (In love), so, please (So)
[Chorus]
Papa, don't preach
,
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach
, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh
[Outro]
Papa, don't preach
,
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach
, I've been losing sleep
Papa, don't preach
,
I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach
, I've been losing sleep
Papa, don't preach
(Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby)
Papa, don't preach
(Ooh)
Papa, don't preach
(Don't you stop loving me, daddy)
Papa, don't preach
(I know I'm keeping my baby)
