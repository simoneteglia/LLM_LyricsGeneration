[Intro]
Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate
[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be
It would be so nice
[Verse 1]
Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation
[Pre-Chorus]
It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together, to release the pressure
We need a holiday
[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate (Come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (Holiday)
It would be
It would be so nice
[Verse 2]
You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate
[Pre-Chorus]
Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together and make things better
We need a holiday
[Chorus]
If we took a holiday (Holiday)
Took some time to celebrate (Celebrate)
Just one day out of life (Just one day)
It would be
It would be so nice
[Refrain]
Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate
[Chorus]
If we took a holiday (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Took some time to celebrate (Come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (Holiday)
It would be, it would be so nice
[Outro]
Holiday
