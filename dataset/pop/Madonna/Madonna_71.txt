[Intro]
There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait, the more time that I waste
[Verse 1]
I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own
[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump
[Verse 2]
We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see
[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?
[Verse 3]
There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that you wait, the more time that you waste
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own
It sways and it swings and it bends until you make it your own
[Breakdown]
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?
