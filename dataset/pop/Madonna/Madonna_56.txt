[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wake up, yes and no
I'm gonna kiss some part of
I'm gonna keep this secret
I'm gonna close my body now
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess, die another day
[Chorus]
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day (Another day)
I guess I'll die another day
[Spoken Ad Lib]
Sigmund Freud
Analyse this, analyse this
Analyse this, this, this, this, this
[Verse 2]
I'm gonna break the cycle
I'm gonna shake up the system
I'm gonna destroy my ego
I'm gonna close my body now
[Ad-Lib]
Uh
Uh
[Chorus]
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go
For every sin, I'll have to pay
A time to work, a time to play
I think I'll find another way
It's not my time to go
[Verse 3]
I'm gonna avoid the clich√©
I'm gonna suspend my senses
I'm gonna delay my pleasure
I'm gonna close my body now
[Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I think I'll find another way
There's so much more to know
I guess I'll die another day
It's not my time to go
[Ad-Lib]
Uh
Uh
[Laughter]
I need to lay down
[Chorus]
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
I guess, die another day
I guess I'll die another day
[Outro]
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
Another day
