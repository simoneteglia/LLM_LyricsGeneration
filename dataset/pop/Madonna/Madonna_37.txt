[Verse 1: Jude Demorest,
Ryan Destiny

]
Must be hurting for jobs
They way they stay in my business
Must be searching for God
They way they playing my witness
Must be looking for moms
They way they act like my sons
Ah, they kinda cute, can we take
them home?
I wouldn't raise these bums
(yeah)
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Destiny,
Brittany O'Grady
,
Jude Demorest
]
You see me, on a screen
So familiar but you ain't seen a thing
Wanna know my
history
, like it's tea
Well I got questions for you, like you got answers for me
[Chorus: All]
Who your boss? Who's your king?
Who's the leader of your team?
Who's your mama and your daddy?
Is they rich like me?
They screaming "I bring me"
Bitch, I'm the one that brought the table
I'm the boss, I'm the king
Pick a team, pick a team, yeah
[Verse 2: Ryan Destiny,

I was made by a woman but I raised myself
I was made by the streets but I raised my wealth
Now ask me one more time who's the baby dad
I'm immaculate, Madonna bitch
I'm the man
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Destiny,

You see me, on a screen
So familiar but you ain't seen a thing
Wanna know my history, like it's tea
Well I got questions for you, like you got answers for me
[Chorus: All]
Who your boss? Who's your king?
Who's the leader of your team?
Who's your mama and your daddy?
Is they rich like me?
They screaming "I bring me"
Bitch, I'm the one that brought the table
I'm the boss, I'm the king
Pick up team, pick up team
Who your boss? Who's your king?
Who's the leader of your team?
Who's your mama and your daddy?
Is they rich like me?
They screaming "I bring me"
Bitch I'm the one that brought the table
I'm the boss, I'm the king
Pick up team, pick up team, yeah
