[Intro]
I feel it, it's coming
[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain
[Verse 1]
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I knew you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what this thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
'Til I feel your
[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain
[Verse 2]
When you looked into my eyes and you said goodbye
Could you see my tears?
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky?
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
'Til I feel your
[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain
[Bridge]
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away
[Spoken Interlude]
(Waiting is the hardest thing)
(
It's strange
)
(I tell myself that if I believe in you)
(
I feel like I've known you before
)
(In the dream of you)
(
And I want to understand you
)
(With all my heart and all my soul)
(
More and more and more
)
(That by sheer force of will I will raise you from the ground)
(
When
I'm with you I feel like a magical child
)
(And without a sound, you'll appear)
(
Everything strange
)
(And surrender to me)
(
Everything wild
)
(To love)
[Verse 3]
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
'Til I feel your
[Chorus]
Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on my window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like
[Chorus]
Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like rain
[Outro]
I'll stand out on the mountain top
Waiting for you to call
My name
Rain
