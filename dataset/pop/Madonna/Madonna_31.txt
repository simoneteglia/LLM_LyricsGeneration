[Outro: Quavo]
It's the future where we come from, bein' stars
It's the future where we come from, bein' hard
It's the future where we come from, beat 'em all
It's the future where we come from, bein' boss
It's the future where you gotta pay the cost (The future)
It's the future where you come from, bein' lost (The future)
It's the future, crucifixion on a cross (Woo)
But you know that I'ma rise above it all, yeah
