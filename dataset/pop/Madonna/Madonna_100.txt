[Verse 1]
Put your head on my shoulder, baby
Things can't get any worse
Night is getting colder
Sometimes life feels like it's a curse
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't wanna carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor
[Chorus]
Mmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm
Swim to the ocean floor
[Verse 2]
Children killing children
While the students rape their teachers
Comets fly across the sky
While the churches burn their preachers
[Pre-Chorus]
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't wanna carry any more
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor
[Chorus]
Mmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm
Swim to the ocean floor
[Bridge]
Let the water wash over you
Wash it all over you
Swim to the ocean floor
So that we can begin again
Wash away all our sin
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't wanna carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor
[Chorus]
Mmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm
Swim to the ocean floor
[Pre-Chorus]
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't wanna carry any more
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor
[Outro]
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Mmmm
Mmmm
