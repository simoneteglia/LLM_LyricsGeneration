[Post-Chorus Variation]
Oh, my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh, my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
[Verse 1]
When you read my mind
Get down and discover me
I'm an open door
Let you come inside of me
Want to put my hands
Around your neck
Gonna take you to a place
That you will not forget
[Chorus]

Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top

I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
[Verse 2]
Oh, my god, let me clean your wound
I can be your nurse
Got the antidote
Please show me where it hurts
Can you be my father?
Tell me what to do

And maybe I will punish you
[Chorus]

Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh, my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude
I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
Oh, my

Silver chains, pretty girls
Thigh-highs, leather mask
High heels, golden mask
Perfume, switchblade
Absinthe, novocaine
Chopsticks, underwear
Bar of soap, dental chair
Fish nets, satin sheets
Garter belt, raw meat

Licorice whip

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh, my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude

And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby
