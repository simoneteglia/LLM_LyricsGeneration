[Verse 1]
Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore
[Refrain]
Let's
Let's
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious, honey
[Verse 1]
Today is the last day that I'm using words
They've gone out, lost their meaning
Don't function anymore
[Chorus]
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
To the arms of unconsciousness
[Refrain]
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
[Verse 2]
Words are useless, especially sentences
They don't stand for anything
How could they explain how I feel?
[Chorus]
Traveling
I'm traveling
Traveling
Leaving logic and reason
Traveling
I'm gonna relax
Traveling
In the arms of unconsciousness
[Refrain]
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
[Bridge]
And inside we're all still wet
Longing and yearning
How can I explain how I feel?
[Refrain]
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
Let's get unconscious, honey
Let's get unconscious
[Chorus]
Traveling, traveling
Traveling, traveling
Traveling, traveling
In the arms of unconsciousness
[Outro]
And all that you've ever learned
Try to forget
I'll never explain again
