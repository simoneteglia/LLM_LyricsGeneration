[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Oh, mm
What? Mhm
Let's dance, again
[Verse 1: Madonna]
Don't sit there like some silly girl
If you wait too long, it'll be too late
I'm not tellin' you something new
There ain't no time to lose (No time to lose)
It's time for you to celebrate
[Refrain: Pharrell Williams &
Madonna

You don't have the luxury of time
You have got to say what's on your mind
Your head lost in the stars
You'll never go far (No time to lose)
It's time for you to read the signs
[Refrain: Pharrell Williams,
Madonna

Stand in the back or be the star (
Don't sit in the back

[Verse 3: Kanye West,

Here's a impromptu, I want you
Now I'm gon' to tell you what I want to (Uh-huh) do to you
Your girlfriend, she wants to, beautiful
Just flew in from Paris, voulez-vous?
In a city that don't snooze (
I can't keep waiting for you
)
Schmooze amongst the who's whos
And I use my celeb to get this one home
Why everything that feel good gotta be so wrong?
Give me room now (
Hey
)
I'm like a vampire under full moon now (
Hey
)
And I don't know about you now (
Hey
)
But I think I wanna try somethin' new now, see what it do now
And when you sat down (
Hey
), uh
'Cause you was losing your breath now (
Hey
), uh
'Cause you be doing it to death now (
Hey
)
She be doin' E to F now, what's left now?
Mr. West now (
Hey
)
Can you get any more fresh now? (
Hey
)
I think I just did, just now (
Hey
)
Talkin' my shit, that's how (
Hey
)
I'm a professional, I admit that (
Hey
)
"Flashing Lights", yo, I lived that
(
Hey
)
Fame is a drug, wanna hit that? (
Hey
)
'Cause I know exactly where to get that (
Hey
)
Did you get that?
[Outro: Kanye West,
Madonna

Get down, beep beep
Gotta get up off of your seat
Get down, beep beep
Gotta get up off of your seat now
On and on

The beat goes on and on
'Cause they know exactly where to get that
Did you get that? (
Let's go

Get down, beep beep
Gotta get up out of your seat now

The beat goes

Get down, beep beep
Gotta get up out of your seat now

The beat goes, on and on
