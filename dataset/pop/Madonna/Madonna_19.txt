[Intro]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
[Refrain]
Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie,
do you like my acid rock?
[Verse 1]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
[Pre-Chorus]
Music, music, music, music
Music, music, music, music, music
[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel
[Verse 2]
Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie (Uh-uh!)
It's like ridin' on the wind and it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day
[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel
[Interlude]
Hey, Mr. DJ
[Refrain]
Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie,
do you like my acid rock?
[Verse 3]
Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy (Uh-uh-uh)
[Chorus]
Music, makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel
[Refrain]
Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie,
do you like my acid rock?
Do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie, do you like to?
Boogie-woogie,
do you like my acid rock?
