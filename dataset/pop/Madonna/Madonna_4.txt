I, mother of my house, vow, to keep my f–ing mouth to myself (La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
You make me smile, I vow to love thy hater
I believe in you, you can do it
Release ya anger, release ya mind
Release ya job, release the time
Release ya trade, release the stress
Release the love, forget the rest
(You
can do it
)
Release, repressed, suppressed, regressed, redirect all that anger (To me)
Give it to me (To me), give it to me (
You can do it
)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé &
Madonna
]
I just fell in love
And I just quit my job (
Move to the music
)
I'm gonna find new drive
Damn, they work me so damn hard
Work by nine
Then off past five
And they work my nerves
That's why I cannot sleep at night (
You know you can do it
)
[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm lookin' for motivation (You motivate me)
I'm lookin' for a new foundation, yeah (Thank you)
And I'm on that new vibration (Just keep speaking my name)
I'm buildin' my own foundation, yeah
Hol' up, oh, baby, baby (Hol' up)
[Chorus: Beyoncé &
Madonna
]
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul
You won't break my soul (
Go with the flow
)
You won't break my soul (
You know you can do it
)
I'm tellin' everybody, na, na
Everybody
Everybody (
Go with the flow
)
Everybody (
You know–
, I'm built for this)
[Post-Chorus: Big Freedia]
I'm 'bout to explode, take off this load
Bend it, bust it open, won't ya make it go
I'm 'bout to explode, take off this load
Bend it, bust it open, won't ya make it go
Bend it, bust it open, bend it, bust it open, bend it, bend it
Bend it, bust it open, bend it, bust it open, bend it, bend it
Yaka-yaka, yaka-yaka, yaka-yaka, yaka-yaka
Yaka-yaka, yaka-yaka, yaka-yaka, yaka-yaka
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'ma let down my hair 'cause I lost my mind
Bey is back and I'm sleepin' real good at night
The queens in the front and the Doms in the back
Ain't takin' no flicks but the whole clique snapped
It's a whole lot of people in the house
Tryna smoke with the yak in your mouth
And we back outside
You said you outside, but you ain't that outside
Worldwide hoodie with the mask outside
In case you forgot how we act outside
