[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's okay to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl
[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?
[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?
[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?
[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?
[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?
[Outro: Madonna]
For a girl
In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
What it feels like in this world?
