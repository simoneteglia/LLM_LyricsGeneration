[Verse 1]
I live my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say, "Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?"
I said, "Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be"
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, "Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for"
[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart
[Verse 2]
I've spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say, "Look at you, look at you"
Tryin' to be so provocative
I said, "Oh, yeah, that was me
All the things I did just to be seen"
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, "Oh, yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be"
I said, "Hell, yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be"
[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart
[Outro]
In my rebel heart
In my rebel heart
