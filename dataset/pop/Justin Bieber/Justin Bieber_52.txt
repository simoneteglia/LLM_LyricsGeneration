[Intro: Asher Roth &
2 Chainz
]
"Boyfriend" remix
Yeah
2 Chainz
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Uh, nine times out of ten, you a ten
If your schedule open, I'll pencil you in
Ight, wiggle it in, get with your friend
Laugh now, cry later, hope you ticklish then
Let's figure it out, I figured it out
Shawty so thick she put a dent in my couch
And dent in my wallet, I'm diggin' her probably
I told her, "Let's kick it" (Kick it), karate (Damn)
Got a black belt on, Versace (Uh)
Wanna get my eat on, Hibachi
2 Chainz on with a pinky ring (Ring)
If I'm your boyfriend, you can have anything
(Anything?) Anything (Anything?) Everything
(Everything) I can upgrade you to better things (True)
(Hello) You hear that wedding ring? (Yeah)
And if you answer, then we settling
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey, girl, let me talk to you
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Youngin' gettin' money, all these honeys say they love me
Buddha belly, how I'm lucky, girls be rubbin' on my tummy
I can be your man, get you everything you need
Have you ever had a Rollie, Stewart Weitzman on your feet?
And you can be my queen, couple thousand on the jeans
'Cause I'm down to do some spendin' on the women of my dreams
Marvin told us we should get it on, right here in the restaurant
Ain't no point in waitin', baby, I can get you what you want
Leprechaun gold, got leprechaun gold
And I came out hot like I was steppin' on coals
But I never got cold, keepin' extra long dough
For a rainy day, need a vacation, name a place, we can go
Where I'm tryna take you, we gon' need a boat
Independent raps, yeah, my life is like the Beatles though
Invest a big check to make sure you get fresh
'Cause if I was your boyfriend, I'd treat you like a princess (Princess)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey, girl, let me talk to you
[Chorus: Justin Bieber &

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want (
Asher Roth
)
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go (
Yeah
), never let you go
[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
And we can be like Selena and Biebs
Wild and free, a couple disobedient teens
Sneakin' out to meet around like two o'clock in the eve
Paparazzi ain't a problem, we just hide on the beach
Girl, you hotter than me, let's go fly overseas
Or just slide up in the closet, never findin' the key
'Cause seven minutes in heaven ain't enough when we're together
Kisses to the forehead, when I slide my hands to second (Uh)
Wait a second, smilies in a text
I kinda be interested, I'm lyin', girl, I'm obsessed
Stylish sun dresses, legs in jean shorts
Please pick me, love is a team sport (Uh)
I'll be your boyfriend, jokes and pillow talk
Lay around in our undies, chill, play Tony Hawk
Dance slow in the dark, come roll with the Roth
'Cause when that falsetto hits, y'all gonna know who to call
So, JB
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey, girl, let me talk to you
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
So give me a chance, 'cause you're all I need, girl
Spend a week with your boy, I'll be callin' you my girlfriend
If I was your man (If I was your man), I'd never leave you, girl
I just wanna love and treat you right
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go (Woo, yeah)
I'd keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone (Never be alone)
And I can be a gentleman (A gentleman), anything you want
If I was your boyfriend (Boyfriend)
I'd never let you go (If I was your boyfriend), never let you go
[Outro: Justin Bieber]
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na (Uh), na-na-na, yeah, girl
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na, yeah, if I was your boyfriend
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na (Uh), na-na-na, hey
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na, hey, if I was your boyfriend
