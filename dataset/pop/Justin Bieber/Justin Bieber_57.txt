[Verse 1]
Not sure what I was doing before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin' like havin' someone for you
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you're here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown
[Chorus]
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
[Post-Chorus]
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah
[Verse 2]
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt
[Chorus]
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
[Post-Chorus]
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah, yeah, yeah
