[Verse 1]
One touch and you
got me stoned
Higher than I've ever known
You call the shots and I follow
Sunrise, but the night's still young
No words, but we speak in tongues
If you let me, I might say too much
[Pre-Chorus]
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober, I'm not thinkin' straight
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed
Too late, now you're in my blood
I don't hate the way you keep me up
[Pre-Chorus]
Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Outro]
By you, ooh-ooh-ooh
