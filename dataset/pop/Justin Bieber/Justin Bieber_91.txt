[Intro]
Epic Rap Battles of History
Justin Bieber vs Ludwig van Beethoven
Begin
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Look what the cat dragged back from the dead
Man it looks like Chewbacca wiped his ass on your head
I’m the next Michael Jackson,
you smell like Betty White
Here’s some aspirin, you’re catching Bieber Fever tonight
Because my voice is incredible
and your music is terrible
Who even listens to Classical anyway?
Even Elise wants to do me
and now that you’re right next to me
I can understand why they used a dog to play you in the movies
[Verse 2: Beethoven]
Sit down, son, and let me give you a music lesson
Ask Bach,
I got more cock than Smith and Wesson
Never say Never? You’ll never be forgetting
I’ve crafted masterpieces that will last throughout the ages
Your music gets you bitches on your Facebook pages
I’m committing verbal murder in the major third degree
My name is Beethoven motherfucker
Maybe you’ve heard of me?
Not the Saint Bernard Version, I’m the real O.G
You wanna trade blows?
You can’t even hit puberty!
[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
I got Kim Kardashian in my bed backstage
When’s the last time your music got anybody laid?
I’ve got a concert in five, so there’s not much time left
What else can I say? Your own music made you deaf!
[Verse 4: Beethoven]
I would smack you but in Germany we don’t hit little girls
And I’m glad I’m deaf, so I can’t hear that piece of shit “My World”
There’s a crowd of millions waiting to hear my symphonies
You wanna be a little white Usher? Here, show them to their seats!
[Outro]
Who won? Who's next? You decide
Epic Rap Battles of History
