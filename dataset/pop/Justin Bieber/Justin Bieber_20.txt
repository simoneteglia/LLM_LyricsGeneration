[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat

I-I-I-I-In time, ink lines
B-B-Bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, i-i-it's mine
Ten little letters on a big sign
Justin Bieber
You know I'ma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, wiener
But I gotta keep an eye out for Selener
B-B-Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the East
Beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets
Beat will get deceased
Every time Beauty on the beat eats
Body rock
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh
(Yeah, yeah)
I wanna feel your body rock
(Let's go, let's go)
(Frrrrr, yeah)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all I need (All I need is love)
Is a beauty and a beat (A beat)
Who can make my life complete (Complete, oh-oh-oh, oh woah)
It's all 'bout you (All I need is you)
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do (Do)
Cause you-
[Instrumental Drop]
