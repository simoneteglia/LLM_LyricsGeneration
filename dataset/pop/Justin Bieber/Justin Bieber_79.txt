[Verse 1]
Oh, darlin', there's not much that you can say
To stop me from fallin' in like I am
Oh, darlin', even waves can't wash away
Our names in the sand, never could, never can
[Pre-Chorus]
You are my everything, I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know you're the one
[Chorus]
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I lеarned, it wasn't my turn, it wasn't the right time
Somе people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime
[Verse 2]
Oh, darlin', there's no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh, darlin', I would walk that broken road
Time and time again if it led me to your hello
[Pre-Chorus]
You are my everything, I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow, every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well, I know, I know you're the one
[Chorus]
Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned, it wasn't my turn, it wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But, baby, you are a lifetime
[Outro]
Baby, you are a lifetime
