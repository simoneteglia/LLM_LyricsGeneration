[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company
[Verse 1]
Let's end each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I'll tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change
[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious
[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company? (Oh)
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company
[Post-Chorus]
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
[Verse 2]
It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much
[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious, no
[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh
[Chorus]
Can we be, can we be
Be each other's company?
Be each other's company (Oh)
Just be each other's company
Be each others company (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company? (Oh)
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company
