[Verse 1]
When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine slipped my hands
But this the one I'm not givin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was
[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the things that you show me (Show me)
I need you, don't let me go, need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight
[Verse 2]
I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh, yeah
I don't wanna be my past
Oh, when we kiss, I'm alive and I feel brand new
There's nothing that I want more than us (Na-na-na-na-na)
[Pre-Chorus]
Night after night, you fall asleep on me (Sleep on me)
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was (Oh, no, no no, no)
[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (Oh)
I need you, don't let me go (No), need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight
[Bridge]
Somewhere in the sky (Yeah), the way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me, I'm so high, but I'm fallin' (Na-na-na)
And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah), as you dance around the room (Yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong (Oh)
[Chorus]
I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (I can't live without you)
I need you, don't let me go (Hey), need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–(I don't), I don't de–(I don't)
I don't deserve you tonight (You)
[Outro]
(I don't deserve you)
No, I don't, no
(I don't deserve you)
Girl, I need you, I can't breathe without you
