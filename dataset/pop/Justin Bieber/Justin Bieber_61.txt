[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
High heels on, heard you comin' 'fore I seent ya
Movies all around, but you look like the feature
Had another meeting, now my plan is to meet you
Got my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare
Where you posted up? I wanna be there
Way you curved up, it just ain't fair
No, it ain't
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber &
Travis Scott
]
Got me feeling giddy (
Ah
), like, "La, la, la, la" (
Yeah
)
Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la" (
It's lit
)
You got the keys to my city (
Ooh
), like, "La, la, la, la" (
Straight up
)
Do you second that emotion, baby? (
Ah, yeah
)
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Mmm, yeah
Out to big boys (It's lit)
Spring her off the hitch (Yeah), everything legit
Movin' like the blitz (Blitz), crib like the Ritz (Like the Ritz)
So you know there's room (Skrrt)
So, baby, please
(Hold up, nah, nah, nah, that was the first time she did that)
Don't like to talk to bitch (Yeah), just like to play the wish
I know the problem is they bothered by the kid (I'm tryna pop another one in)
Oh, you sent the jet out for me?
You tryna ball harder than me?
[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
Did I come 'cross your radar?
Cross your mind now and later?
Do you feel like you know me?
It's just a part of nature
Let's ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor? Baby
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it (Ooh-wee)
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head (Hey, hey, hey)
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it (Ooh-wee)
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
You really got me open (Do you?)
Do you second that emotion? (Do you?)
[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Got me feeling giddy, like, "La, la, la, la"
Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la"
You got the keys to my city, like, "La, la, la, la"
Do you second that emotion, baby?
