[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber &
Ludacris
]
You know you love me (
Yo
), I know you care (
Uh-huh
)
Just shout whenever (
Yo
), and I'll be there (
Uh-huh
)
You are my love (
Yo
), you are my heart (
Uh-huh
)
And we will never, ever, ever be apart (
Yo, uh-huh
)
Are we an item? (
Yo
) Girl, quit playin' (
Uh-huh
)
We're just friends (
Yo
), what are you sayin'? (
Uh-huh
)
Said, "There's another" (
Yo
), and looked right in my eyes (
Uh-huh
)
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (
Yo, uh-huh
)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber &
Ludacris
]
Oh, for you, I would've done whatever (
Uh-huh
)
And I just can't believe we ain't together (
Yo, uh-huh
)
And I wanna play it cool (
Yo
), but I'm losin' you (
Uh-huh
)
I'll buy you anything (
Yo
), I'll buy you any ring (
Uh-huh
)
And I'm in pieces (
Yo
), baby, fix me (
Uh-huh
)
And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream (
Yo, uh-huh
)
I'm goin' down (
Yo
), down, down, down (
Uh-huh
)
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around, and I'm like
[Chorus: Justin Bieber &
Ludacris
]
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine (
Luda!
)
[Verse 3: Ludacris]
When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone), I'm gone
