[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Don't go, don't—
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't—
Don't go
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
My Mona Lisa, baby, my masterpiece, bae (My masterpiece)
When I'm in pieces, baby, you give me peace of mind
You tell me, "We'll be fine," you always get me right
When it's dark, you're my light
Baby, that's why I need you on the regular (Baby, that's why I need you on the regular)
And if it wasn't you, no, it would never work (No, it would never work)
Got me goin' out my way to show you what you're worth
Don't go (Don't go)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I put in the work to hear you say (Don't go, don't—)
Misery missin' your company (Don't go, don't go)
See 'em pullin' at you that way (Don't go, don't—)
Ooh, if this is where you're supposed to be (Don't go)
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber &
Don Toliver
]
I woke up in the city, I ain't seen your face
Almost lost my mind, medication (Woah)
Five stars for participation (Yeah), it's a COVID operation (Woo)
Hope you hear this where your stationed (Stationed)
I lost my Bonnie, by that time, you already banged it (Banged it)
She armed and dangerous, that long hair got me tangled up
You are my Topanga, stood your ground, even when they aimed at us
(
Yeah, yeah
)
Even through all of that pain, none of it was in vain (
None of it was in vain, yeah
)
And I'm proud of who you've become, hope you feel the same (
The same, yeah
)
Frozen, don't let me go (Don't go, don't—), but let it go
, please
We've been so close, don't go ghostin' me (Don't go, don't go)
My vital OG, that's all on the record, you make me better (Don't go)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I put in the work to hear you say (Don't go, don't—)
Misery missin' your company (Don't go, don't go)
See 'em pullin' at you that way (Don't go, don't—)
Ooh, if this is where you're supposed to be (Don't go)
[Verse 3: Don Toliver &
Justin Bieber
]
Peace and love (Peace and love,
don't go, don't—
)
You talk about him like he's decent enough (Decent enough,
don't go, don't go
)
I see you moving, is he keeping up? (Keeping up,
don't go, don't—
)
Don't know what you're doing but you're needing love (Needing love,
don't go, don't—
)
Needing love (Needing love,
don't go, don't—
), how far can you get, girl?
You know I've been in love with you since the beginning, girl (
Don't go, don't go
)
Talking out of tone to me, gotta be kidding, girl (
Don't go, don't—
)
Get you all alone with me, gotta be committed, yeah (
Don't go
)
[Bridge: Justin Bieber &
Don Toliver
]
Girl, I need to see your face,
hit the gas to win the race (
Yeah, yeah
)
Thirty pounds of loaded bass
, move it, babe, I love the chase
Do your dirt, I keep the taste (Yeah), pop that shit and make me wait (Yeah, yeah)
Shorty like that (Shorty like that), she call me up but I might be late (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I put in the work to hear you say (Don't go, don't—)
Misery missin' your company (Don't go, don't go)
See 'em pullin' at you that way (Don't go, don't—)
Ooh, if this is where you're supposed to be (Don't go)
[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Don't go, don't—
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't—
Don't go
