[Verse 1]
Girl, you don't know how I feel, (How I really feel)
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call? Take my call
If I dialled you today, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinkin' about you all day long, hopin' you pick up your phone
Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby
[Chorus]
Oh girl, I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
And, baby, nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
[Verse 2]
Girl, you see me standin' here (Standing here)
Standing in the rain, oh baby
Any chance you could stay right here, yeah yeah
And never go away?
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinkin' about you all day long, hopin' you pick up your phone
Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my  heart's breaking, heartbreaker
[Bridge]
So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you (Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool)
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm callin' your name
(Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love)
And you know I don't wanna lose that
,
'cause I still believe
[Verse 3]
I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us
,
you don't see
'Cause what you don't see
is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feel it, the way that I feel it
I wanna know if you feel it, the way that I, the way that I
[Outro]
And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart
