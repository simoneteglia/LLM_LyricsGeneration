[Intro: Justin Bieber]
PYD, PYD, PYD
PYD, PYD, PYD (I'ma put you down)
PYD, PYD, PYD (down)
PYD, PYD, PYD (I'ma put you down)
PYD, PYD, PYD (all the way down, woah)
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
From the door to the wall
Coffee table, girl get ready
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down, woah (PYD, PYD, PYD)
From the stove to the countertop
Dining room table, are you ready?
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
Woah (PYD, PYD, PYD)
Up the stairs, to my bedroom
Light a few candles, prepare yourself
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
On a plane, a train
An automobile, doesn't matter
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And it donâ€™t make no sense, to be that bad
I'ma take it down on you babe (PYD, PYD, PYD)
Put ya down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
This will show you how much I love you
Form of appreciation
I'ma put ya down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ooh cause you deserve the best and nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'ma put you down
[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
On the roof (baby) balcony (baby)
We don't care (baby) who sees
Girl I'ma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down, down, down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
After the club, in the parking lot
I don't care anywhere, you could pick the spot, whatever
I'ma put you down, yeah (PYD, PYD, PYD)
All the way down, yeah (PYD, PYD, PYD)
Cause I've been doing forensics on your body in this club
And I can tell the way you walk yo body ain't been touched the right way
It seems yo man been treating you like a stepchild
Sub 'em out, sub me in
and I'ma get on the floor and shut the whole game down
Until I hear you cheering babe
Have you spelling out my name babe
See I wanna give my love
Be your dope man in the bedroom, you can make me your drug babe
[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
And it don't make no sense, to be that bad
Oh no, baby (PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'm gonna put ya, down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
Gonna show you how much I love you
Form of appreciation yeah, no (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
[Chorus: R. Kelly &
Justin Bieber

Oh cause you deserve the best and nothing but the best
So I'll give you the best you've ever had
I'm gonna put ya down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'm gonna put ya down, all the way down
Ooh cause you deserve the best and nothing but the best
So I'll give you the best you've ever had
I'ma put ya down
I'ma put you down girl, I'ma put ya down, yeah
I'ma put ya down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
