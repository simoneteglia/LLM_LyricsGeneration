[Intro: The Kid LAROI]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Unstable
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber &
The Kid LAROI
]
Sometimes I think I overthink (
Think I
)
And I start to feel anxiety (
Anxieâ€”
)
There were times I couldn't even breathe (Mmm)
But you never once abandoned me (
No, you never, ooh
)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber
with The Kid LAROI
]
I tried to
scare you, scare you away
Showed you the
door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of
mind
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged, never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
White knuckles tryna hold my sanity (Hold my)
Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me (Never know)
But you're the one I call for security (Oh, baby)
These memories have been toxic (Oh)
I tried to wean and get off it (Oh)
Through everything, you been my rock
I think you're the only thing I didn't get wrong
Oh, I know God was listening
Every night when I would pray
You're an angel watchin' over me (Oh)
All I need
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber
with The Kid LAROI
]
I tried to
scare you, scare you away
Showed you the
door, you adored me anyway
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged, never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
