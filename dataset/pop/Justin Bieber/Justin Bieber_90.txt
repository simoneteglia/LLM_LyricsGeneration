[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You pull up in a foreign
You that New York time, easy Sunday morning (Front seat)
When we touch, I think we skip a beat (Beep, beep, beep)
It's a movie with you, got me at the edge (Let me see)
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
There’s beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss, I'm not used to this
There's nothin’ I won't give
Don't like makin' promises, just remember this
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you arе
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for
[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You'rе the fruit of my life
That patient kind, that tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why I will love you different
Just the way you are
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
No matter how different, you’re beautiful
I can’t make this up, no, baby
, ain't no need to beat your face in
Fenty,
want you on the cover, undercovers ain’t no rubbers
On this planet, I'll treat you like a mother, let's make babies
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
There's beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss
I’m not used to this
There's nothin' I won't give
Don't like makin' promises
Just remember this
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for
[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber &
BEAM
]
You're the fruit of my life
That patient kind, that tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why I will love you (
Ooh
) different (
Ooh
)
Just the way you are
[Verse 3: BEAM]
I and I need you in my life
Even when the fire burnin', I need you fi di light
It's a different night with you right by my side
You mix the color, color, color, color, see the future bright
This the mutual, it's not usual when I'm around you, I-I-I (Oh)
Dem goosebumps, dem goosebumps, the truth hurt and you know
A real ting we feel this time (Oh)
You gimme goosebumps, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for
