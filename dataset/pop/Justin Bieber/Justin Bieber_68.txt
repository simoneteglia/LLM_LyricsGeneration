[Intro: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothin' like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feelin' is mutual
Lovin' the way you move on me
Skin's so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know, that
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me, babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh, girl
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I need a one dance (One dance)
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance (Yeah)
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go ('Fore I go)
Body lockin', put a hold on me (Hold on me)
[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One more dance is all I need
One more dance is all I need
Oh, oh, oh
