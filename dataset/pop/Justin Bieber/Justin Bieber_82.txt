Justin Bieber
Pop star Justin Bieber
Denied he fathered a child
There is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that
There is also a pretty white hot spotlight
And you found yourself under it recently, some headlines
To set the record straight, none of it is true
Do you know this woman?
Never met the woman, so
No? Okay, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh
Life in the fast lane, as they say
[Verse 1]
She said she met me on the tour
She keeps knocking on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl, she wouldn't stop
Almost had to call the cops
She was schemin', ooh, she was wrong
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didn’t give it to her, I'm talking to you
[Chorus]
Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
'Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
[Verse 2]
Now she's in the magazines
On TV making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news
Saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
She got mad cause I didn’t give it to her, I'm talking to you
[Chorus]
Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
'Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
[Bridge]
Why are you trying, trying to lie, girl?
When I ain't never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You do this, you prove this
Your foolness, seduces
[Chorus]
Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
Cause she's talking it, she needs to quit
But I never hit it; I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
And she wilding out when she talk about
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
[Outro]
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl
