[Intro: Quavo &
Justin Bieber
]
Guala,
what's up Migos?
What up JB? It's time to go to the club
Time to pull those toys out man skrr
Let's do it
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Hey where the party at? Let's go, let's ride, Let's roll
Yeah, everywhere I go them girls follow, na, na, na, na
Let everybody know that I'm here tonight, as soon as I walk in the door
Hey, pretty lady I think I need you in my life, in fact I know I need you for sure
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you
[Chorus: Quavo]
Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it
Ain't a problem baby girl, when youâ€™re winning
Tell me what you wanna do, we can make a move now
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feelin', tell me why you grinning
I think you're likin' what I'm sayin'
Do I really gotta say any more?
You need to know that I ain't playin'
Baby what are we waitin' for?
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you
[Chorus: Quavo]
Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
[Verse 3: Quavo]
Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs (lean!)
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him
[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out,
Giussepe steppin'
with a mink
,
gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"
[Verse 5: Offset]
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you
[Chorus: Quavo]
Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
