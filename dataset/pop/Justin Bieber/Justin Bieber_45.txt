[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See, you're lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Ooh, there's so much chemistry
Like a chemist, how you finishin' my sentences
In the center, no, we can't deny this energy
How 'bout reapin' all the benefits? Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no
