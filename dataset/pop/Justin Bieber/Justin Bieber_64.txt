[Verse 1]
It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths
[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood
[Chorus]
They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad
[Verse 2]
Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn
[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do
[Chorus]
They try to get at me, they try to get at me
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad
