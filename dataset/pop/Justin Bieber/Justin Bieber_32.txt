[Verse 1]
Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long, long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh, yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone, and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why
[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me
[Verse 2]
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe
[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
