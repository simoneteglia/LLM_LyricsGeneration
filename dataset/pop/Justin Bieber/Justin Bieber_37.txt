[Verse 1]
You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone
[Pre-Chorus]
Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
[Chorus]
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way
[Verse 2]
You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (Can't get close)
[Pre-Chorus]
Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
[Chorus]
I need you to hold on (Hold on)
Heaven is a place not too far away (Away, yeah)
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on (Oh, oh, oh-woah, oh-woah)
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way
[Post-Chorus]
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (I will be there for you)
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you
[Chorus]
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on (Hold on)
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Ooh, yeah)
Feels to be someone who loses their way
[Post-Chorus]
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you
