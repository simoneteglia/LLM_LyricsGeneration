[Intro]
What do you mean it's not like that?
Oh, you're sorry?
Well, where are you now that I need you?
But girl, let me tell you something
[Chorus]
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
[Verse 1]
Every time I leave the city you
Been hangin' out with him like I don't know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin' him that we don't even talk no more
Every time he leave the city, you
Try to run game on me like it's just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
When you hit my line, it don't mean that much
[Chorus]
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
[Verse 2]
Every time I leave the city you, you, you
Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
Said you're lyin' 'bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein' absent
Take advantage, yeah
And I really tried taking you serious baby, itâ€™s really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl livin' in my heart and cross
Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost
Would I double cross?
[Chorus]
We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone
Cause you don't really care about my love
Call me on that hotline bling
If you wanna be with me
Call me on that hotline bling, right now
If you wanna be with me
