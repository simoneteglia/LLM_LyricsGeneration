[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout what we had
I know it was hard,
it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there's no one, I can relate to
And know we won't find a love that's so true
[Chorus]
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
[Verse 2]
I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
[Pre-Chorus]
But that is the past now,
we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see
[Chorus]
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
