[Intro: News Reporters]
[?] wants to make contact [?]
It’s been 72 hours since the crash
A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
Extraterrestrials
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
[Chorus: Justin Bieber &
Hayley Gene Penner
]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
[Chorus: Justin Bieber &
Hayley Gene Penner
]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Greetings, I fell from the sky
I’m from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And our flying saucer crashed, I’m the only one that survived
I’ve only taken over this planet since I arrived
I’m in a backpack, I’m ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I’m an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne’s world
[Bridge: News Reporters]
Reports from witnesses flooded into the police station
Sounds like something out of a movie
After [?]
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
UFO [?]
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens
[Chorus: Justin Bieber &
Hayley Gene Penner
]
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet’s outside there waiting
I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
[Outro: Justin Bieber & Nasri]
In our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother and
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
