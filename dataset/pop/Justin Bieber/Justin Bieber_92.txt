[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Honest (Honest)
You're modest, I like it (I like it)
You stay down and you the baddest (Baddest)
Find you in the cut, I copped it (I copped it)
Honest (Honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (With me from jump)
It's 23 when you get dunked on (Splash)
I put it in and that shit sunk (And that shit sunk)
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Off top, you the sun in my morning (In my morning)
I tried to get away, but it's boring (But it's boring)
You're my safe haven I needed all along (All along)
And you're my dime piece and I can't take less than one (Less than, you the)
You the (Yeah, yeah)
You the one (You thе one)
Trinity, you like three in one (Three in onе)
Ratio, ten to one (Ten to one)
You get spicy (You get spicy)
I like that cajun on you (Yeah)
On occasion, that's your testimony (That's your testimony)
I like that hazel on you (Like that hazel on you)
I look straight in your eyes, holy matrimony (Yeah)
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Honest (Honest)
You're modest, I like it (I like it)
You stay down and you the baddest (Baddest)
Find you in the cut, I copped it (Copped it, yeah)
Honest (Honest)
You kept it real with me from jump (With me from jump)
It's 23 when you get dunked on (Splash)
I put it in and that shit sunk (And that shit sunk)
[Verse 2: Don Toliver]
Yeah, honest (Honest)
Spicy, I like it (Yeah)
FaceTime me the weed, I just might buy it
Throw it back on the couch, I just might try
Ooh, spicy (Yeah, yeah)
Damn, that booty thick, I like it (Yeah)
Hey, Justin B. (Yeah)
I know you don't do this often, but this here sneak and geek (Sneak)
Fuck that McLaren, I'm ridin' the Jeep (Yeah)
I got in the club with all of my thugs, I'm packin' that
Pistol Pete
(Yeah, yeah)
Better watch your mouth, gotta pick a side before you jump and leap (Leap)
I was sellin' the nickels and dimes in dubs, but crack in my sock, it ain't me (Me)
But, baby, I like it (I like it)
I'ma pull that double R to your crib just for once (Just for once)
It's 23 when you get dunked (It's 23 when you get dunked)
Me and JB, we smokin' skunk
