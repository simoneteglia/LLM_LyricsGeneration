[Verse 1]
Hey, what's the situation? Woah
I'm just tryna make a little conversation
Why the hesitation? Woah
Tell me what your name is, for your information
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't get me wrong, you know you're right
Don't be so cold, we could be fire
Tomorrow we'll go, let's start tonight
You know what it's all about, woah
[Chorus]
I could take you out, I could take you home
I could take you, oh, where you wanna go
I could pick it up, we could take it slow
I could take you, oh-oh-oh-oh
I could take you out, I could take you home
I could take you, oh, where you wanna go
I could pick it up, we could take it slow
I could take you, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I might have a reputation, woah
But there's only me and you in this equation
I promise this occasion, woah
Is a different situation, for your information
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't get me wrong, you know it's right
Don't be so cold, we could be fire
Tomorrow we'll go, let's start tonight (Tonight)
You know what it's all about
[Chorus]
I could take you out, I could take you home
I could take you, oh, where you wanna go
I could pick it up, we could take it slow
I could take you, oh-oh-oh-oh
I could take you out, I could take you home
I could take you, oh, where you wanna go
I could pick it up, we could take it slow
I could take you, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Breakdown]
I could take you out
I could take you home, yeah, yeah, yeah
I could take you out
I could take you home
