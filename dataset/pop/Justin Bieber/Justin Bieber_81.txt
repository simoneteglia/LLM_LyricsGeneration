[Verse 1: Cody Simpson]
I don't work harder when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one
[Pre-Chorus: Cody Simpson]
The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
[Chorus: Cody Simpson]
Because I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
And girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season and I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you, that you're the one
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm the one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Because I'll take you home to mama
I'll let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends
You're way more than worth it
And I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect
You're my kind of perfect
