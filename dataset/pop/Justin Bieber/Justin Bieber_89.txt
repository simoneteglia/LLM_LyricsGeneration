[Chorus]
No I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think
it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing baby
[Verse 1]
And that moment was so hard for me to breathe, yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life was so unpredictable
, yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone, oh no
Didn't waste any time
But you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line, oh yeah
[Chorus]
But I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy
,
oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away
like it was nothing girl
It was a bad day, hey girl
I knew I was wrong, but you could've said goodbye baby
It was a bad day, now I'm like woah
It was a bad day, it was a bad day
