[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthday
[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc
,
but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh
[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee
[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
[Bridge]
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away
, ooh
[Chorus]
They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
