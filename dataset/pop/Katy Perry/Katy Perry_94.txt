[Verse 1]
I take these turns a bit too fast
Trying to leave you in my past
The CD skips our favorite songs
Our greatest hits just don't belong
I really love to hate this
Love, hate, hate-love
[Pre-Chorus]
Relationships are overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over and I could go for
Another chance to do this over again
[Chorus]
So this is it? After all we've been through
We called it quits and now I'm about to
I've lost my grip or what little I had left
You said it's over and I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me, you'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose
[Verse 2]
I pop these pills like Cracker Jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes just watching you react
When you're depressed, you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up
[Pre-Chorus]
It's overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over and I could go for
Another chance to do this over again
[Chorus]
So this is it? After all we've been through
We called it quits and now I'm about to
I lost my grip or the little I had left
You said it's over and I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me, you'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
You said it's over and I could really go for
A cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me, you'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
[Outro]
I stood in line without you
Oh
I stood in line without you
I, I-I-I, I, I stood in line
I stood in line without you
And I don't tell you
All they ever thought (I stood in line without you)
About you (I stood in line without you)
Well, without you (I stood in line without you)
Is everything I've got
I stood in line without you
And I don't tell you (Yeah, only, if only)
All they ever thought about you (Ever thought about you, pretty face)
About you
Well, without you
Is everything I've got
I stood in line without you
And I don't tell you
All they ever thoughtâ€¦
