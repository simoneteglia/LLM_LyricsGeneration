[Verse 1]
Waking up next to you in the middle of the week
Never needed anyone to send me off to sleep
And I know I said go slow, but I can't hold back no more
Got a premonition this ain’t gonna be a fling
You make the weekend feel like a year
Baby, you got me changing
24/7, I want you here
I hope you feel the same thing
[Chorus]
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night
Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind?
3-6-5, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
And give me the night and day
[Verse 2]
Love it when you come back and can’t take it when you leave
Got me fantasizing our initials already
And I wanna just let go, falling deeper than before
Say that you are ready, lock it up in a heartbeat
[Chorus]
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night
Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind?
3-6-5, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
And give me the night and day
[Post-Chorus]
I think about you all the time
24/7, 3-6-5
I think about you all the time
24/7, 3-6-5
[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Are you gonna be the one? (One, one, one, one)
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh
Are you gonna be the one? (Are you gonna be the one?)
I want you to be the one
[Chorus]
I want you to be the one that's on my mind
On my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night
Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind?
3-6-5, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
And give me the night and day
[Post-Chorus]
I think about you all the time
24/7, 3-6-5
I think about you all the time
24/7, 3-6-5
