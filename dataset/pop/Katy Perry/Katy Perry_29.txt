[Intro]
This is how we do
This is how we do
(Oh-oh)
[Verse 1]
Sipping on Ros√©
Silver Lake sun coming up all lazy (
This is how we do

Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as a daisy (Oh-oh)
Playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy (
This is how we do
)
Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah
All my girls vintage Chanel, baby (Oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
It's no big deal
This is no big deal
[Chorus]
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting, yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do
This is how we do
This is how we do, yeah
Chilling, laid-back, straight stunting, yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
Big hoops and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati (
This is how we
)
Santa Barbara-chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties (Oh-oh)
Now we talkin' astrology
Getting our nails did all Japanese-y (
This is how we do
)
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke (Oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
It's no big deal
It's no big deal (
Uh-uh

It's no big deal
This is no big deal

Yo, this one goes out to the ladies at breakfast, in last night's dress
Uh-huh, I see you (
It's how we do, straight stunting like that, uh-huh

Yo, this goes out to all you kids that still have their cars at the club valet
And it's Tuesday (
It's how we do, straight stunting like that, uh-huh
)
Yo, shoutout to all you kids buying bottle service with your rent money
Respect! (
It's how we do, straight, yeah
)
[Chorus]
