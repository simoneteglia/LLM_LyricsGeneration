[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don’t lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don’t lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world
[Verse 1]
You can catch a star if the sky is falling down
There's a golden lining up in every single cloud
You can take a frown, turn it all the way around
All the way around, all the, all the way around
A fortune teller told me, "The power's in your mind"
You might see a cliff, but I see a way to fly
Flipping off the flop, now I just enjoy the ride
Just enjoy the ride, yeah, I just enjoy the ride
[Pre-Chorus]
(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye)
[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we’re attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don’t lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world
[Verse 2]
You can make a wish even on a satellite
On a plastic lash or anything you like
You can tame the dragon if you’re not afraid to fight
Not afraid to fight, no, I'm not afraid
[Pre-Chorus]
(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye) Don't say goodbye
[Chorus]
It’s not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
[Outro]
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Don't say goodbye
