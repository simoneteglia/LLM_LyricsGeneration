[Intro]
Did somebody say Just Eat?
Ding-dong
,
ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Did somebody say Just Eat?
[Verse 1]
Want my curry in a hurry (Medium spice)
Extra sauce on the low (Boo won't know)
And I want
açai
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when I'm ordering delivery
[Verse 2]
A little sushi while I watch a movie
Papaya salad while I sing a ballad
Need some ice cream, make it a swirl
Gotta treat this California girl
[Pre-Chorus]
When you’re running low there's only one place to go
'Cause I get what I want, when I want it (When I want it)
Margherita with extra cheese on it
Download, now all I gotta do is pull out my phone
Easy: One, two, three
Mocha-whip triple-shot,
it means a latte to me
[Chorus]
Did somebody say Just Eat?

[Verse 3]
Back from the club (Sandwich)
Eating subs in the tub
(Famished)
Spicy chicken when I’m ready
Bon Appétit from me, Katy Perry
[Pre-Chorus]
When you’re running low there's only one place to go
'Cause I get what I want, when I want it (When I want it)
Margherita with extra cheese on it
Download, now all I gotta do is pull out my phone
Easy: One, two, three
Mocha-whip triple-shot,
it means a latte to me
