[Verse 1]
You’re a one-of-a-one, a one-of-a-kind
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks and opens a gold mine
[Pre-Chorus 1]
They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter
[Verse 2]
Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say one man’s trash is another girl’s treasure
So if it’s up to me, I’m gonna keep you forever
[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
[Verse 3]
Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning
It was striking, you couldn't deny it
[Pre-Chorus 3]
They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
The two of us together make everything glitter
[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
[Bridge]
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you (Oh)
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you (Oh)
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
'Cause I understand you
We see eye-to-eye
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go (And wherever you go), so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find
[Outro]
It's hard to find
Oh, it's hard to find
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
