[Verse 1]
Please don't tip-toe
Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me
And get lost at sea
The world's your oyster
And I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly
[Chorus]
So, baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami
[Verse 2]
Don't fight, just ride
The rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze
And sail away smoothly
[Chorus]
So, baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami
[Bridge]
Ohh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide (
Can't hide
)
Tsunami (
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
)
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise (
Inside
)
Tsunami (
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
)
Tsunami
[Chorus]
So, baby, come and take a swim with me (
Take a swim with me
)
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy (
Make me ripple, baby
)
Don't be scared to dive in deep (
Don't be scared to
)
And start a tsunami (Ayy)
Tsunami
