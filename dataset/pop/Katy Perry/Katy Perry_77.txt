[Verse 1]
She is a pyramid
But with him, she's just a grain of sand
This loves too strong, like Mice and Men
Squeezing out the life that should be let in
She was a hurricane
But now she's just a gust of wind
She used to set the sails of a thousand ships
Was a force to be reckoned with
[Pre-Chorus]
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he’s scared of the light that’s inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark
[Chorus 1]
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she’s become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a pearl
[Verse 2]
She was unstoppable
Move fast just like an avalanche
But now she’s stuck deep in cement
Wishing that they never ever met
[Pre-Chorus]
She could be a Statue of Liberty
She could be a Joan of Arc
But he’s scared of the light that’s inside of her
So he keeps her in the dark
[Chorus 1]
Oh, she used to be a pearl, oh
Yeah, she used to rule the world, oh
Can't believe she’s become a shell of herself
'Cause she used to be a...
[Bridge]
Do you know that there’s a way out?
There’s a way out, there’s a way out, there’s a way out
You don’t have to be held down
Be held down, be held down, be held down
[Breakdown]
'Cause I used to be a shell
Yeah, I let him rule my world, my world, oh yeah!
But I woke up and grew strong and I can still go on
And no one can take my pearl
[Chorus 2]
You don’t have to be a shell, no
You're the one that rules your world, oh
You are strong and you'll learn that you can still go on
And you'll always be a, a pearl
[Outro]
She is unstoppable
