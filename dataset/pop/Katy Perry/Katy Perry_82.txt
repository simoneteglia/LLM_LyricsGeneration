D-D-D-D-D-DY
¡Ay, Daddy!
Play N' Skillz
Katy Perry
Run!
[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
What's your name, baby?
A little mezcal got me feelin' spicy
I know that we don't speak the same language
But I'm gonna let my body talk for me (Talk for me)
Hello, my name is Katy
A little mezcal got me feelin' naughty
I know that we don't speak the same language
So I'm gonna let my body talk for me (Talk for me)
[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]
Quietly, I wanna see her shakin'
Move that boom-boom, girl
She's a killer, when she dancin' she wants everybody to see her
I like your boom-boom, girl
Quietly, I wanna see her shakin'
Move that boom-boom, girl
She's got adrenaline, on the stage come on, do whatever you want
I like your boom-boom, girl (Hey!)
[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Dress up with my girls, on the hunt tonight
Got a feelin' I'ma catch a wild one
I know that I'm not typically your type
But you never had this kind of stimulation
All eyes on me when I light up the room
You play the right vibe and my body will move
Easy baby, I see you're in the mood
Me too
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Quietly
I see you're lovin' the way I work the floor now
I got the boom-boom, boy
You could be my Puerto Rican dream, I'll be your California girl now
I got the boom-boom, boy
Quietly
I see you're lovin' the way I work the floor now
I got the boom-boom, boy
You could be my Puerto Rican dream, I'll be your California gurl now
I got the boom-boom, boy
[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee]
You got the fire, I got the candle
Call 911, floor is burnin'
I hurt when she shakin' her skirt
Mami, you're insane, but your show keeps going on
You're known as the party queen
That body is too much...
Come on, don't-don't-don't stop
Wow! Dale, dale (yo')
We're going crazy cause' of music and romance
And, let's go DJ, turn it up to dance
Go', go', go' back
Go', go', front and back
[Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Katy Perry]
Quietly, I wanna see her shakin' (Quietly)
Move that boom-boom, girl (Girl)
She's a killer, when she dancin' she wants everybody to see her
I like your boom-boom, girl
Quietly
I see you're lovin' the way I work the floor now
I got the boom-boom, boy
You could be my Puerto Rican dream, I'll be your California girl now
I got the boom-boom, boy
[Verse 4: Snow]
Come with a nice young lady (Let’s go)

Everywhere me go me never lef' her at all-ie (Tell her)

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Katy Perry]

You could be my Puerto Rican dream, I'll be your California girl now
I got the boom-boom, boy
