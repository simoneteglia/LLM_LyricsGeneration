[Verse 1]
I'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened
[Pre-Chorus]
Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender
[Chorus]
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way
[Verse 2]
I used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance
[Pre-Chorus]
So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender
[Chorus]
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way
[Refrain]
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
[Outro]
So do I start over, re-rediscover?
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
No
