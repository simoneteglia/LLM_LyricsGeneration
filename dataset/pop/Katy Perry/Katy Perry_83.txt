[Verse 1]
I leave the gas on, walk the alleys in the dark
Sleep with candles burning, I leave the door unlocked
I'm weaving a rope and running all the red lights
Did I get your attention? 'Cause I'm sending all the signs that
The clock is ticking and I'll be giving my two weeks
Pick your favorite shade of black, you'd best prepare a speech
Say something funny, say something sweet
But don't say that you loved me
[Chorus]
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh
[Verse 2]
Maybe I was too pale, maybe I was too fat
Maybe you had better, better luck in the sack
No formal education, I swore way too much
I swear you didn't care 'cause we were in love
So as I write this letter and shed my last tear, know
It's all for the better that we end this here
Let's close this chapter, say one last prayer
But don't say that you loved me
[Chorus]
I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Oh, we've been diagnosed
So let's give up the ghost
'Cause I'm still breathing
But we've been dead for a while
This sickness has no cure
We're going down for sure
Already lost our grip
Best abandon ship, oh
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
Oh
