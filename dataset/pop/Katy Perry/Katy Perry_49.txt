[Intro]
(Uh)
[Verse 1]
I wanna see you soon as I wipe the crust from my eyes
'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a soldier for you, baby,
I earned all my stripes
, ah
[Pre-Chorus]
Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
So now we know it's worth it
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far, ah (Uh)
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now
'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now (Woo)
[Verse 2]
I wanna see you soon as I wipe the crust from my eyes
'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a baller for you, baby, I pay any price, ah
[Pre-Chorus]
Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
Became a better version
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far
We both know the hardest part is over
Pull me closer, pour a drink (Uh)
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby all we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now (That's all we got)
'Cause, baby, all we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, that's all we got (All we got are)
Champagne problems now
Yeah, that's all we got
All we got, all we got (All we got are)
Champagne problems now
[Bridge]
We both know the hardest part is over
Pull me closer, pour a drink 'cause, baby
Oh woah, all we got
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, all we got (No, no, no, no; all we got are)
Are champagne problems now (That's all we got, baby)
'Cause, baby, all we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, that's all we got
All we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now (Champagne problems)
Yeah, that's all we got
All we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now
Champagne problems now
