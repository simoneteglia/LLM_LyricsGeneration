[Verse 1]
"This is the last time," you say
After the last line you break
It's not even a holiday
Nothin' to celebrate ('Brate, 'brate, 'brate)
You give a hundred reasons why
And say you're really gonna try
If I had a nickel for every time
I'd own the bank (Bank, bank, bank)
[Pre-Chorus]
Thought that I was the exception
I could reroute your addiction
You could've been the greatest
But you'd rather get wasted
[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
[Verse 2]
You say it helps you write your rhymes
Whatever helps you sleep at night
You become what you despise
A stereotype-type-type-type
You think you're so rock and roll
But you're really just a joke
Had the world in the palm of your hands
But you fuckin' cho-o-o-oked
[Pre-Chorus]
Should've been my teammate
Could've changed your fate
You say that you love me
You won't remember in the morning
[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
[Bridge]
(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
(Nine, one, one)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
(
I'm not stickin' around, I'm not stickin' around
)
Wanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother
Can't be your savior, I don't have the power
I'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain
[Outro]
Watch you circle the drain
Watch you circle the drain
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down)
(You're goin' down, you're goin' down, I know)
You fall asleep during foreplay
'Cause the pills you take are more your forté
I'm not stickin' around to watch you go down
