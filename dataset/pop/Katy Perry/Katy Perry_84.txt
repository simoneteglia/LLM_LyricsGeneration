[Verse 1]
I'm out on my own again
Face down in the porcelain
Feeling so high, but looking so low
Party favors on the floor
Group of girls banging on the door
So many new fair-weather friends
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
[Verse 2]
Caught in the eye of a hurricane
Slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
So sick of this town pulling me down, oh
My mother says I should come back home, but
Can't find the way 'cause the way is gone
So if I pray, am I just sending words into outer space?
[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Known the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost?
[Bridge]
Is there a light, is there a light
At the end of the road?
I'm pushing everyone away
'Cause I can't feel this anymore
Feel this anymore
[Chorus]
Have you ever been so lost?
Know the way and still so lost
Another night waiting for someone to take me home
Have you ever been so lost? (Been so lost)
Have you ever been so lost?
[Outro]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
