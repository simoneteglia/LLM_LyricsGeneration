[Intro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
[Verse 1]
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard with an open heart
(I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong?
(I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
[Chorus]
Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine
[Verse 2]
(I'm wide awake)
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece and landed on my feet
(I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den, I don't have to pretend
(And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
[Chorus]
Fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm fallin' from cloud nine
[Bridge]
(I'm wide awake)
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am tryin' to hold on
(I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore
[Break]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
Crashin' from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm fallin' from cloud nine
[Outro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
