[Verse 1]
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
[Verse 2]
We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know)
That you're not gonna change
[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no (Oh)
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o (Oh)
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down (Down)
[Bridge]
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
[Break]
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot, then you're cold (Oh-oh-oh)
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right (Oh-oh-oh)
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no (Oh)
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o (Oh)
You're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
