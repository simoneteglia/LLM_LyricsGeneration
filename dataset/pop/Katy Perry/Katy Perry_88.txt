[Intro]
Ah
Dressin' up, dressin' up, for you, for you
Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you
Ah
[Verse 1]
Saucer of milk (Saucer of milk), table for two
You wanna pet my kitty? You're such a dirty doggie
Itâ€™s your lucky night (Your lucky night), 'cause I'm in the mood
Oh, I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty
[Refrain]
Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen,
a Lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you
[Verse 2]
I can tell you're obsessed (Tell you're obsessed)
By your shortness of breath
Ooh, my Cookie Monster
wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer
[Pre-Chorus]
Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh, boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
(Dressin' up)
[Verse 3]
You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever, let's take your temperature
Better behave or a police officer
Will have to hold you down, give you what you deserve
[Pre-Chorus]
Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh, boy, I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you
[Bridge]
Tied tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, 'bout to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling
[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you (Oh)
[Outro]
(Dressin' up)
I'm dressin' up for you (Oh, yeah)
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you (Oh)
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up for you
