[Verse 1]
My fire through cold nights
The brightest of all lights
You are my home
Wherever we go
Oh whoa oh
[Pre-Chorus]
We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need, yeah
[Chorus]
Every day is a holiday (Holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Every day is a holiday (Ooh-ooh)
When you're the reason, oh
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate (You're the reason)
Every day is a holiday (Oh whoa)
When you're the reason, you are the reason
[Verse 2]
And my heart can't stop singing
You can't fight this feeling
Unspeakable joy
Ringing through my soul
Oh whoa oh
[Pre-Chorus]
We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need
[Chorus]
Every day is a holiday (Holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Every day is a holiday (Ooh-ooh)
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday (Every day is a holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate (You are the reason)
Every day is a holiday (Oh whoa)
When you're the reason, you are the reason
[Bridge]
We don't need a thing, oh, under the tree
'Cause you give me all I need, hey
[Chorus]
Every day is a holiday (Every day, now)
When you're the reason to celebrate (You're the reason, baby)
Every day is a holiday (Oh)
When you're the reason, when you're the reason (Woo!)
Every day is a holiday (Every day, yeah)
When you're the reason to celebrate (Yeah, baby)
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
