[Verse 1]
A big beautiful brain with a pretty face, yeah
A babydoll with a briefcase, yeah
A hot little hurricane,
ha!
'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah
Red lipstick, but still so raw, yeah
Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichés and norms all in a dress
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
(
Br-br-break me
)
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I bounce back like a pro 'cause I'm so resilient
LOL at all your limits (
Ha!
)
Keep your penny thoughts, I'm making a mint
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichés and norms all in a dress
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me (
Ah
)
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me (
Uh-uh
)
(
Br-br-break me
)
[Bridge]
I ain't got no strings (
No strings, no strings, no strings
)
I'm no one's little puppet
Got my own cha-ching, in my chubby little wallet
And secretly you love it
(
You fucking love it
)
And secretly you love it
[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey (
Hey
)
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile
like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking,
but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile
like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (
No
)
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (
No way
)
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (
Uh-uh
)
Oh, you think that I am cracking, but you can't break me (
Uh-uh
)
(
Br-br-break me
)
