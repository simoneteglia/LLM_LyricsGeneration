[Verse 1]
Voted most likely
To end up on the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm letting 'em down
'Cause $7.75
Isn't worth an hour of my hard-working time
When you can't afford half the **** they advertise
Oh, I'm worth more than a X
More than a toe-tagged generation full of regrets
Oh, I won't settle, no, oh
Oh, I can't settle
[Pre Chorus]
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight
[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy, I
Gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you
[Verse 2]
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather than end up begging on the streets
Trading under-table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention
[Pre Chorus]
I wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air, I'm not going down without a fight
[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy, I
Gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
[Bridge]
Don't give up
But don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh, not in the sand, in the sand,
in the sand, in the sand
[Chorus]
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy, I
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
It's my life
And I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching (I want you to remember me)
It pass me by
I'm leaving you my legacy, I
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I-I'm leaving my fingerprints in the end
