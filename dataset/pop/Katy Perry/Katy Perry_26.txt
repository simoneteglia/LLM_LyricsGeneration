[Verse 1]
Oh no, did I get too close?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time
[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally
[Verse 2]
So come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you areÂ worthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm, I would
I'd do it all because I love you
I love you
[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally
[Post-Chorus]
So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart
[Bridge]
Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me?
[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
And there is no fear now
Let go and just be free
'Cause I will love you unconditionally, oh yeah
[Outro]
I will love you (Unconditionally)
I will love you
I will love you unconditionally
