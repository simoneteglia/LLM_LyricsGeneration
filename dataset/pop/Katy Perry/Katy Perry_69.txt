[Verse 1]
He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know
[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl for even dreaming that I could?
[Chorus]
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah
[Verse 2]
Snow White said when I was young
"One day, my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
[Pre-Chorus]
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign, wait for it
One hundred percent, worth every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences
[Chorus]
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, he'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, oh-oh yeah
[Bridge]
'Cause I know you're out there
And you're, you're looking for me
Oh-oh-oh
It's a crazy idea that
You were made perfectly for me, you see
[Chorus]
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic, with the perfect ending, ohh
It's not like the movies, oh
But that's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning
