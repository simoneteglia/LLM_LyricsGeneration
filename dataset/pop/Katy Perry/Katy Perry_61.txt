[Intro]
I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it
[Verse 1]
Can't go with the flow, got to make waves
Even though I look at the sand, and I'm just one grain
But my intuition says there's a bigger mission I must embrace
So I'm, I'm pushing my thoughts to a new place
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen
[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
[Verse 2]
So I'll speak my truth though my voice shakes (
I can see it
)
Try to summon the strength to look fear in the face
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen
[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (
out of control
)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
[Interlude]
Happening
(Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening
(Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it happening
[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (
Out of control
)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening
[Outro]
Happening
(I can feel it)
Happen,
(I can see it)
I can see it happening
(I can feel it)
Happen, I can see it
