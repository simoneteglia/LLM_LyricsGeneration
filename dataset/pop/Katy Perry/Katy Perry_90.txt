[Verse 1]
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knockin' on wood
Hopin' there's a real boy inside
[Chorus]
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
[Verse 2]
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts and I can't seem to find your heart
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh
I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again
[Chorus]
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a, a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man
[Bridge]
If the past is the problem, our future could solve 'em, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man
[Chorus]
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
A toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy?
Understand
But you're not a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
