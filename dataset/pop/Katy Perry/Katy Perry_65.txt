[Intro]
Do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do
[Verse 1]
I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
'Cause they just get in my way
[Pre-Chorus]
(The way) The way (You look) you look at me (At me)
Is kinda like a little sister
(High five) You high five your goodbyes (Your goodbyes)
And it leaves me nothin' but blisters
[Chorus]
So I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
One of the girls (Just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys
[Verse 2]
So over the summer, something changed
I started reading
Seventeen
and
Shaving my legs and
I studied
Lolita
religiously (Yeah)
And I walked right into school and caught you
Staring at me 'cause
[Pre-Chorus]
(I know) I know (What you) what you know (Know)
But now you're gonna have to take a number
(Okay) It's okay, (Maybe) maybe one day (One day)
But not until you gimme my diamond ring
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your (I just wanna be)
Homecoming queen (Just wanna be)
Pinup poster dream
(Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys
[Bridge]
I wanna be a flower, not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day, you're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me
[Break]
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be (I just wanna be)
One of the girls (Just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys
[Outro]
Do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do
