[Chorus]
When I'm gone,
I'm never really gone
You think you're movin' on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're movin' on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like
[Verse 1]
Thought it would be easy
Easy to forget me
Let go of the memories (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Now your bed is empty
And you're wakin' up sweating
I'm still in your wild dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
Late nights, callin' me, callin' me
Do anything to keep me close
Well, you should know it's gonna be, gonna be
So hard for you to let me go
[Chorus]
When I'm gonе, I'm never really gonе
You think you're movin' on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're movin' on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like
[Post-Chorus]
Me on top of you
Touch you like I do
No, you'll never forget
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're movin' on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like
[Verse 2]
You're chasin' the danger
It's just in your nature
Look for me in strangers (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
All these pretty faces
No one can replace it
I'm always your favorite
[Pre-Chorus]
Late nights, callin' me, callin' me
Do anything to keep me close
Well, you should know it's gonna be, gonna be
So hard for you to let me go
[Chorus]
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're movin' on (You think you're movin' on)
But it won't be for long, you'll see (When I'm gone)
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone (Never really gone)
You think you're movin' on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like (No one's gonna, no one's gonna feel like me)
[Post-Chorus]
Me on top of you
Touch you like I do
No, you'll never forget
When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're movin' on
But no one's gonna feel like, feel like
(Like me)
[Outro]
When I'm gone
When I'm gone
