[Verse 1]
I know there's gotta be rain if I want the rainbows
And I know the higher I climb, the harder the wind blows
Yeah, I've gone to sleep night after night punching a pillow
But do you know the darker the night, the brighter the stars glow?
[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh no
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
You'll see me grow right through the cracks, yeah
'Cause you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks
[Verse 2]
I've got to shed all the skin if I want the distance
Let the sun in, pull out the weeds and focus my vision
'Cause there’s no mistakes, just bends and breaks and friction
But do you know the hotter the fire, the purer the gold is?
[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, oh yeah
I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh
[Bridge]
'Cause I died every winter
But survived all the weather
Look at me now, look at me now
I'm in full bloom, yeah
They tried to poison the water
But I was a little stronger
Look at me now, look at me now
I light up the room, oh yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause I am resilient (I am resilient)
A full flower moment
Won't let the concrete hold me back, no
Oh, I am resilient
Born to be brilliant
I'm gonna grow right through the cracks
Oh, you're gonna watch this flower grow
Right through the cracks
