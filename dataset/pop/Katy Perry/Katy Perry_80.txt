[Verse 1]
You are my hurt locker lover
Keep me walking on a wire
Don't know when you'll blow
So I tiptoe through your triggered mind
You fight me, but I'm on your side
Defeated, now retreating
[Pre-Chorus]
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing
[Chorus]
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
I am not fighting anymore
[Verse 2]
I've tried to pick off your red flags
While dancing on broken glass
Your mind games hit like grenades
Feel cursed, just like the Kennedys
But you somehow get me on my knees
Defeated, now retreating
[Pre-Chorus]
Why you tryna make me your enemy?
All we really need is a little peace
I just wanna be your lover
Oh, this is not a competition
So baby, why the ammunition?
I don't wanna be the last one standing
[Chorus]
Choose your battles, babe
Then you'll win the war
Stop digging your own grave
When there's so much to live for
Choose your battles, babe
'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
No, I am not fighting anymore
[Bridge]
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway
I am not fighting anymore
[Chorus]
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) Then you'll win the war
('Cause I don't wanna fight no more) Stop digging your own grave
(Baby, baby) When there's so much to live for
(If you wanna go, then go) Choose your battles, babe
(If you wanna stay, then stay) 'Cause I'm not fighting anymore
(I don't wanna fight no more, anyway, anyway)
I am not fighting anymore
[Outro]
If you wanna go, then go
If you wanna stay, then stay
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby, baby
I am not fighting anymore
If you wanna go, then go
