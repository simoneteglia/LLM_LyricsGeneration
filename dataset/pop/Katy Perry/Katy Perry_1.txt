[Intro: Fatboy Slim]
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin'
,
lay 'em up like
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout as cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin', lay 'em up like
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket (Let's go)
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos, no, not Offset
Swish swish, aw, I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aw, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back, I already despise you (Yeah)
All that fake love you showin' couldn't even disguise you
Yo, yo
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
The generous queen'll kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be ridin' by
I'ma tell my **** Biggz, yeah, that's the guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket (And another one, and another one)
Can't touch this (Can't touch this)
Another one in the casket (And another one, and another one)

They just strut
