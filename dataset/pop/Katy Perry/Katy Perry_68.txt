[Verse 1]
Flowers in her hair, she don't care
Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) You think you've seen her in a magazine
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) It's like she walked right out of your dreams
Black Ray Bans, you know she's with the band
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) Yeah, she runs the place like Penny Lane
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane
[Pre-Chorus]
From Tokyo, to Mexico, to Rio!
[Chorus]
That girl's a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can (
If you can
)
Yeah, she's so in demand (
In demand
)
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
[Verse 2]
She's got that je ne sais quoi, you know it
So très chic, yeah, she's a classic
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) Yeah, she's footloose and so fancy free
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) Yeah, she dances to a her own beat
'Cause she's the muse and the artist
Always leaves a trail of stardust
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) 'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh
) And she's a little bit of, “Oh no”
[Pre-Chorus]
From LA, Miami to New York City!
[Chorus]
That girl's a trip
A one-way ticket
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
Catch her if you can (Catch her if you can)
Yeah, she's so in demand (In demand)
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile
[Spoken Interlude]
Please fasten your seatbelts
And make sure your champagne glass isn't empty
We are now approaching the runway
So get ready for take-off
[Breakdown]
She's got that international smile
She's got that one international smile
[Chorus]
That girl's a trip (That girl's a trip)
A one-way ticket (Oh, oh)
Takes you miles high, so high
'Cause she's got that one international smile (She's got that smile)
Catch her if you can
Yeah, she's so in demand (So in demand)
Takes you miles high, so high (Miles high)
'Cause she's got that one international smile
