You know, sometimes you can be blinded by your extreme emotions. I definitely was looking for answers, during that time when I wrote that song, and yeah, I was depressed and sad, and there were thoughts, but there were never actions, thankfully. But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you're the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and
they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you're fine when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it, because they would never understand.
Well, then comes along a song that speaks to you, that makes you feel like "Gosh, I can get through this if she can get through this, I can get through this".
