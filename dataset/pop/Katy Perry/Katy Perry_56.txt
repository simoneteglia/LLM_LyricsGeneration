[Verse 1]
No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
I've been painting us, the picture makes me blush
My imagination at its best
[Pre-Chorus]
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be
[Chorus]
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked
[Verse 2]
Tucked deep, deep in my fantasy
'Cause, in reality, we're a mistake
Don't need permission to do what I do to you
When all you are to me's a sweet escape
[Pre-Chorus]
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be
[Chorus]
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked
[Bridge]
I'll keep you
Yeah, I'll keep you, baby
No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
You're someone that I should forget
Oh, woah, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby (Anytime, anytime, anytime)
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby (Oh)
[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na (Baby)
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked
