[Verse 1]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, "Be afraid"
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
[Verse 2]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
[Pre-Chorus]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
[Bridge]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all
[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
[Outro]
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
