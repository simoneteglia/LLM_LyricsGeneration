[Verse 1]
Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose
[Pre-Chorus]
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed
[Chorus]
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float
[Verse 2]
Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a Nirvana finally
[Pre-Chorus]
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and Heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed
[Chorus]
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float
[Interlude]
You make me float
You make me float
[Chorus]
This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel (Like an angel), all aglow (Oh)
Like a feather (Like a feather), you make me float
[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
You make me float
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, you make me float
