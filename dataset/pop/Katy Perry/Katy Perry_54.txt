[Intro]
Only love, only love
Only love, only love
[Verse 1]
Eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day
I swear lately most of 'em have been a waste
I feel 'em come and go, bury my mistakes
But time just goes on and on in a way
[Pre-Chorus]
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, nah, nothing to lose
[Chorus]
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
[Post-Chorus]
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love
[Verse 2]
I swear sometimes I hear myself talking, getting mad
Take shit so personal, like it really matters
Oh, am I awake, am I sleepwalking? Tell me that
It's scary how quickly I lose perspective and I react
[Pre-Chorus]
If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, no, nothing to lose
[Chorus]
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
[Post-Chorus]
Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love (No)
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me (Mmm)
Only love, only love (Only love, only love)
Give me
Only love, only love (Only love, only love, only love)
Only love, only love (Oh, no, only love)
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me (Oh)
And take the love instead
[Outro]
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead
Give me
Only love, only love
Yeah, give me
Only love, only love
