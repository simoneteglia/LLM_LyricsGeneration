[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So put (So put) your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
[Chorus: Katy Perry &
Skip Marley
]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song (Oh)
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm (
Woah, oh, oh
)
[Bridge: Skip Marley]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ayy, up inna your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling and we about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)
[Chorus: Katy Perry &
Skip Marley
]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat (
Turn it up, turn it up, yeah
)
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (Like a wasted zombie)
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me (Oh, we're all)
We're all chained to the rhythm (Oh, we're all)
To the rhythm, to the rhythm (Chained to the rhythm)
[Outro: Katy Perry]
It goes on and on and on (Turn it up, it goes)
It goes on and on and on (Turn it up, it goes on and on and on)
It goes on and on and on (On and on and on, it goes)
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
