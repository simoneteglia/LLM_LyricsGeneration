[Verse 1]
I'm uptight
Playing by the rules in this game of life
Three hundred sixty-five days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful
[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go
[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, oh-oh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
Let's roll it (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
[Verse 2]
They say, "Everything in moderation"
And sometimes, you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice
[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go
[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, oh-oh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Oh, like roulette (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
Let's roll it (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
Like roulette (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
Let's roll it (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
[Bridge]
So tonight, we test limits (
Test limits
)
Take the safety off for a minute (
For a minute
)
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it
[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you (
Close my eyes with you
)
Like roulette (Oh), ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you (
Lose control, lose control
)
Like roulette (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
Let's roll it (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
(
Let's roll it
)
Like roulette (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
(
Like roulette
)
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you (
Ah, ah-ah-ah
)
Like roulette
