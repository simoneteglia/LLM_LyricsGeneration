[Verse 1]
You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building a life
[Pre-Chorus]
With every kiss and every letter
Every promise of forever
Oh, but you hit "send"
And disappeared in front of my eyes
[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20, I see through you now
[Verse 2]
Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
(I'll be alright) I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every gift and every letter
Every promise of forever
Now is out of sight
Like you were never alive
[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20, I see through you now
[Bridge]
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
So rest in peace
I'll see you on the other side
[Chorus]
And now you're just a ghost
(When I look back, never woulda known that)
You could be so cold
(Like a stranger, vanish like a vapor)
(There's an echo) There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
Oh, and there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20, I see through you now
[Outro]
Now, now, now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
