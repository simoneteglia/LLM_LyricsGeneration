[Verse 1]
I built a wall so high, no one could reach
A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide
They can't hurt me if they don't know me
A full fa√ßade made a mirage outta me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then you came and started digging for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me I had never seen
[Chorus]
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?
[Verse 2]
I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea
[Chorus]
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?
[Bridge]
Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open, just stay open, just stay open
[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause you broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open and now I'm ready
This is intimacy
