[Intro]
Yeah-eh, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
I can feel a Phoenix inside of me
As I march alone to a different beat
Slowly swallowing down my fear
Yeah, yeah
I am ready for the road less traveled
Suiting up for my crowning battle
This test is my own cross to bear
But I will get there
[Pre-Chorus]
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
And I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name
[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
[Verse 2]
I can feel this light that's inside of me
Growing fast into a bolt of lightning
I know one spark will shock the world
Yeah yeah
So I pray for favor like Esther
I need your strength to handle the pressure
I know there will be sacrifice
But that's the price
[Pre-Chorus]
It's never easy to be chosen, never easy to be called
Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall
And I can see the heavens, but I still hear the flames
Calling out my name
[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
[Refrain]
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
[Bridge]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Don't let the greatness get you down
Oh, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
I can see the writing on the wall
I can't ignore this war
At the end of it all
Who am I living for?
[Outro]
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
At the end, at the end
Who am I living for?
