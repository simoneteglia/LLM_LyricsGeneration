[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
[Verse 1]
I know you're thirsty, baby, standing in the heat
I've got the juicy fruit, those sweet peaches and cream
You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink (Ice cold)
Cool as a cucumber, you're coming on to me
You say, "You got the ripest melons on the street"
My honeydew and your banana make a treat
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!
[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
[Verse 2]
You'll have to count your calories when you're with me
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don't wanna share me 'cause I'm such a tasty treat (Yum, yum)
I'll let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I'll even let you eat the cherry on the top
You'll beg for seconds in a diabetic shock (What?)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!
[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
[Bridge]
Open 24 hours, more than 31 flavors
To satisfy your craving
I know you're sick of the Kool-Aid, I got your upgrade
One sip, you'll be salivating
[Chorus]
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
