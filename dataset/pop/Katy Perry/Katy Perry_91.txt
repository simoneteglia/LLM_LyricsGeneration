[Verse 1]
If you want me, the cherry on top
The pick of the pack,
the crème de la crop
If you want me, you better do better than that tonight (Oh-oh)
If you want me, it takes more than a wink
More than a drink, more than you think
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank tonight (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill
'Cause that's the deal
[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
[Verse 2]
If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one-night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by tonight (Oh no)
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause nothing's free
Except loving me
[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
[Refrain]
If you want me, the cherry on top
The pick of the pack, the crème de la crop
[Chorus]
If you wanna ride, just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you wanna ride, just name your price
Don't play cheap with your heart
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check
For me, for me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
