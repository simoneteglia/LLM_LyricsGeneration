[Intro]
(
I wonder what we could have been
)
[Verse 1]
Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been?
(
I wonder what we could have been
)
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished
[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(
I wonder what we could have been
)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(
I wonder what we could have been
)
[Verse 2]
I saw a balloon floating away
I thought, "Did someone let go, or did they lose it?"
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know that I'll do the same
(
You know that I'll do the same
)
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit
[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(
I wonder what we could have been
)
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
[Bridge]
We were a match, but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
(
Sometimes I wonder what we could have been
)
Oh
[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(
I wonder what we could have been
)
I miss you more than I loved you
(
Though we're no longer in existence
)
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(
You'll always be in my orbit
)
[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh (
You'll always be in my orbit
)
No, oh-oh-oh-oh (
You'll always be in my orbit
)
