[Verse 1]
Remember when
I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee?
Under my skin
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
[Pre-Chorus]
Every bone's been broken
But my heart is still wide open
[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
[Verse 2]
With each scar, there's
A map that tells a story
What a souvenir of
Young love's like
Jumping out an airplane
Riding a tidal wave of
[Pre-Chorus]
An ocean of emotion (Of emotion)
My heart rips me wide open
[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
[Bridge]
And I'd cover up these scars
But no make up can make up what we break up
And I can't stop seeing stars
I'm so knocked out whenever you're around-ound, around
[Chorus]
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Oh, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to, oh
[Outro]
No, I can't stop
Oh, I can't stop, no, I can't stop
And I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
I, I, I, I
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
(I, I, I, I)
