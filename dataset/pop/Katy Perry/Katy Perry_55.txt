[Verse 1]
I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
(
The definition of insanity is looping on repeat, and expecting things to change
)
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
(
She always comes to me highly
disguised
, an angel whispering, so many pretty shapes
)
[Chorus]
It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
[Drop]
It's a dance
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
It's a dance
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
It's a dance
[Verse 2]
Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered, (
Twisted and conflicted, so I casually can shoot the shit
)
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
(
Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping-pong
)
[Chorus]
It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
[Drop]
It's a dance
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
It's a dance
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
It's a...
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
[Bridge]
But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out
Oh...
[Outro]
It's a dance
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (
It's a dance
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (
It's a dance
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (
It's a dance
)
(
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you
)
Oh, no, oh, no (
It's a...
)
