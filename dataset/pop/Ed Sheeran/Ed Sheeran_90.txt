[Verse 1]
You're not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I'm searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her
[Pre-Chorus]
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
[Chorus]
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
[Verse 2]
She was mine
I was hers and all that's in-between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be
[Pre-Chorus]
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
[Chorus]
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
[Bridge]
Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me like a sunburn
Don't drop me in, it's not my turn
And if you cut deep, then I might learn
That you'll scar and leave me like a sunburn
[Chorus]
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
