[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm feelin' like a bullet jumpin' out a gun
I'm feelin' like a winner, I feel like the one
You're doing somethin' to me, you're doing somethin' strange
Well, jump back, talk to me, woman
You make me wanna make a baby, baby, uh
[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton]
Supernatural woman, supernatural freak
Don't know what you're doin', got me feelin' weak
Oh, I wanna call you fever, baby, you can set a fire on me
Hot damn, pop it like a pistol, mama
You got me down on my knees, begging please
[Chorus: Chris Stapleton]
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
You red leather rocket, you little foxy queen
Everybody's watching, pretty little thing
Baby, tell me, what's your fantasy?
Come closer, let's talk about it
You want white lines in a limousine
Whipped cream, and everything in between, yeah
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
I'm comin', baby
[Guitar Solo: Bruno Mars]
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
