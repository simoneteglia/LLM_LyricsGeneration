Tonight in Jozi, I'm in Jozi
Mo n korin funwon won jo si
I'm not playing with you, I’m not joking
My third album is loading
Mi o kin fagbo but I'm on molly
I'm on duty, but I'm on lowkey
They wan' do me, they wan' do mi
They wan' do me gan, they wan' do mi
Wo ni won wa mi, wo ni won wa mi

[Verse 3: Ed Sheeran]
Pour out the bottle, I want a leveller (Level up)
When I'm with you, I nеver get enough (Gеt enough)
Slow whine I’m not in a rush
I can hear music when you're here
Tonight, we're rollin', party ’til closing
Since I put the ring on her finger, it's still frozen
Love in slow motion
I wanna feel you over me, yeah
Somethin' magic in your eyes, yeah
Girl, I love the way you ride it
And it happens every time you arrive, that's right
Girl, I want you in my life (yeah)
If there's a heaven, then it's right here
I will never leave your side, stay, tonight, tonight
[Verse 4: Ed Sheeran]
When you wan' see me, when you wan' see me
I'm in West London this evening
Givin' me the feelings, no I'm not leavin'
Until I fly LA next weekend (Next weekend)
Peru, nah, girl, I'd rather go find somewhere quiet
You'll glow, and I'll get lost here in your eyes
Omoge no be so
Girl, you just capture my soul
Omoge no be so
Make me wanna just take you home
[Chorus: Fireboy DML
with Ed Sheeran
