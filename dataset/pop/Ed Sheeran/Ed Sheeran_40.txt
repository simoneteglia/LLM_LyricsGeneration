[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how?
Going through the motions, going through us
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home
[Chorus]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
[Verse 2]
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hopin' you'd stop
[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
But all of my words will always be low
Of all, all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home
[Chorus]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
[Bridge]
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
[Outro]
For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover?
