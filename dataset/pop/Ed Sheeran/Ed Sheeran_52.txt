[Verse 1]
How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together
[Chorus]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
[Verse 2]
I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever
[Chorus]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the bеst in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
