[Verse 1]
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same
[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
[Verse 2]
Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same
[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain
[Verse 3]
Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change
[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
