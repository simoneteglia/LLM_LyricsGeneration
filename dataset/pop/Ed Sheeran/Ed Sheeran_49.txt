[Verse 1]
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spittin' quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me rippin' the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew, but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now, it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoidin' the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years, I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleepin' at a subway station
To sleepin' with a movie star and addin' to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
[Verse 2]
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again, that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whisperin', "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still, they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then, I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rappin' a habit and keep on fashionin' magic
I'm battlin' for respect and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet
I'll take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
I'll take it back now
[Verse 3]
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Puttin' on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considerin' a name change, thinkin' it was hopeless
Rhymin' over recordings, avoidin' tradition
'Cause every day, some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now, absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, livin' life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowin' up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screamin' out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achievin' life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never havin' a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Havin' a pint with McDaid, discussin' records we made
And, every single second, knowin' that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, rememberin' our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
[Chorus]
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love, no, mmm
