[Verse 1]
It hit like a train, I ran out of words
I got nothin' to say, everything hurts
And I know love leads to pain
But memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm
[Pre-Chorus]
The waves came tumblin' down
As you float away, I'm reachin' for ya
[Chorus]
To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
[Verse 2]
Would I miss the flames, the heated reserve?
Oh, I'd remember thе way that you put me first
And what a heart-wrenchin' shamе
That you'll never know, just like tears in the rain, mmm
[Pre-Chorus]
A constant grey in the clouds
When I hear your name, I think of love
[Chorus]
So, tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
[Post-Chorus]
Ah, yeah, life goes on
Ah, yeah
[Bridge]
I watched the sun setting down
I am so afraid, I need you now
[Chorus]
To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
