[Verse 1]
I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missin' you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never gettin' dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not
[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
[Chorus]
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
[Verse 2]
Everybody said we'd be together forever
But I know that I never wanna settle down, come around
Break-up the love like LEGO now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now, I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying, every day, that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss
[Pre-Chorus]
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
[Chorus]
Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
[Bridge]
Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down (Woah)
And I'm thinkin' I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep lookin' around to make sure I'm not the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
[Chorus]
'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
