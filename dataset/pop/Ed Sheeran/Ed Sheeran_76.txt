[Verse 1]
Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
[Pre-Chorus]
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
[Chorus]
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat
[Verse 2]
The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
[Pre-Chorus]
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know
[Chorus]
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
[Bridge]
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat
[Chorus]
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't
And the waves won't break my boat
