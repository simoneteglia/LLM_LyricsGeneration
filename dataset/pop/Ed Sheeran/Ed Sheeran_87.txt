[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah, we been in the rain
Been on the rocks, but we found our way
We've ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We've been in the storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home
[Pre-Chorus]
We've seen the moon reflect on the rollin' tide
Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise
Because thе world looks better when I'm by your sidе
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
[Chorus]
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
[Verse 2]
We been on the road
We've watched the blossom fall to Earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes
[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, we drank your father's whiskey when your grandma died
You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah, the world hurts less when I'm by your side
Oh, I, oh, I, oh I
[Chorus]
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
[Bridge]
Head first, collidin'
Dreamers, collidin'
Universe, collidin'
Your love, let the light in
Head first, collidin'
Dreamers, collidin'
Universe, collidin'
[Outro]
We made love in the sky
Overslept and missed the Northern Lights
You lost your wedding ring, but I didn't mind
‘Cause I got a feelin', baby, we'll be fine
