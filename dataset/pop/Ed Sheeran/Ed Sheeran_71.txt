[Verse 1: Mikill Pane]
Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv makin' dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbin' if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothin' but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal 'cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's gettin' dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities stickin' their noses in
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
[Verse 2: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, your mind, you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice,
you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck, you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is makin' you age
But you're a heroine for takin' the strain of bein' a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where you're from usin' MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out of the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never comin' back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
[Verse 3: Mikill Pane]
Little lady, you're tremblin' with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddlin' nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse callin' police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal goin' mad in the ward now
The cop is tryin' to calm you, tellin' you he won't let no one to harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talkin' to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're havin' a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learnin' more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kickin' knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessin' who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's somethin' new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
And we're all under the upper hand
And goin' mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to die
