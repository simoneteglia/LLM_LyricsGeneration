[Verse 1]
If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe
[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again
[Chorus]
I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life
[Verse 2]
Oh, I could never tell you, "LY"
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet, I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there, you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my
Decisions when I leave your smilin' face
[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again
[Chorus]
Oh, I, I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life
[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again
[Chorus]
I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life
[Outro]
If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
