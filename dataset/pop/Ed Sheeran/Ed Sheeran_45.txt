[Verse 1]
Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waitin' for me
And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
[Pre-Chorus]
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me, ooh
[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes
But we'll be strangers if we see this through
[Pre-Chorus]
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh, Lord, now
[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
[Bridge]
Stumblin' half-drunk, gettin' myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singin' about love
And where it goes wrong
[Chorus]
And all my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
