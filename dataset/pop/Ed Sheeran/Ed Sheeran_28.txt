[Intro]
I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
[Verse 1]
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinkin' of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now (Oh, oh)
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
[Verse 2]
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I donâ€™t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
[Verse 3]
'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus, I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Givin' a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus, I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator
[Chorus]
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
