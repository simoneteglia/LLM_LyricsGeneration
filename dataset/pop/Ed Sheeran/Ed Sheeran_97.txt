[Verse 1]
It's been a while since we been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin'
Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time
[Chorus]
And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
[Verse 2]
It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritise-ise
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one thing I know is this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss
[Chorus]
And I wanna love tonight
One-on-one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
[Chorus]
Love tonight
One-on-one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
[Outro]
In slow motion
In slow motion
