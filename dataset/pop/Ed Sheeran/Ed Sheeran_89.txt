[Intro: Young Thug]
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done
knocked me right off of my feet
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
Young Thug
]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (
You done knocked me right off of my feet
)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya
[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
Young Thug
]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
)
I waited most my life for somethin' real
(
You done knocked me right off of my feet
)
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya
[Verse 2: J Hus]
Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (Mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
Young Thug
]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah (
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet
)
Feels, yeah
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
I waited most my life for somethin' real
Baby, I got the feels for ya
