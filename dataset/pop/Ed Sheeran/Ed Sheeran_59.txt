[Verse 1]
Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waitin' for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changin' the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothin', I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is, you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married, then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I think not
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore
[Verse 2]
Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to "Holocene"
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to Uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad
And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore
[Verse 3]
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writin' a book,
I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In six years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral
And it's just hidin' my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writin' my will before I'm twenty-seven, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
[Chorus]
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore
