[Verse 1]
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again and just replace it
See, I could do without a tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter
I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love
Shrek
'cause we've watched it twelve times
But maybe you're hopin' for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today, you shoulda got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say
And now I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then, you'd laugh at me and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then, you'd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
[Chorus]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now, a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
[Outro]
'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Oh, maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up
