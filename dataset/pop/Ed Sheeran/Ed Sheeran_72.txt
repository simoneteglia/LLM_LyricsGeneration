[Verse 1]
Another day, another life
Passes by, just like mine
It's not complicated (Oh)
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated
[Pre-Chorus]
And do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
[Chorus]
Float down like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday, you were here with me
[Verse 2]
Oh, another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated
[Pre-Chorus]
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
[Chorus]
Float down like autumn leaves
And hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday, you were here with me
[Bridge]
Ooh, how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
And, ooh how I miss you
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
[Chorus]
Float down like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday, you were here with me
[Outro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Touch down like a seven-four-seven
We'll stay out and we'll live forever now
