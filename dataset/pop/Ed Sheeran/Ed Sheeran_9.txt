[Verse 1]
Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
[Verse 2]
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
[Bridge]
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
[Chorus]
Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
[Outro]
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"
