[Intro: H.E.R.]
Ayy, I waited for you all day
[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over
[Chorus: H.E.R. &
Ed Sheeran
]
(
She say
) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(
She say
) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
H.E.R.
]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (
Yeah
)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over
[Chorus: H.E.R. &
Ed Sheeran
]
(
She say
) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(
She say
) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran &
H.E.R.
]
You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (
You know you're, oh
)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know
[Chorus: H.E.R. &
Ed Sheeran
]
I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (
Yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time
)
(
She say
) I don't want your money, baby, oh (
I don't want your money
)
You know I just want your time (Time, time)
[Outro: H.E.R.]
And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah
Want your time, time
