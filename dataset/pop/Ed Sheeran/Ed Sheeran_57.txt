[Verse 1]
It's just another night and I'm starin' at the moon
I saw a shootin' star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
[Pre-Chorus]
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?
[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
[Verse 2]
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playin' "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
[Pre-Chorus]
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beatin' to
[Chorus]
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
[Outro]
And, oh, I know
And, oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From America
