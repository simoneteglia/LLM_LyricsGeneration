[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
Â£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (
Gettin' faded
)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person
, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
