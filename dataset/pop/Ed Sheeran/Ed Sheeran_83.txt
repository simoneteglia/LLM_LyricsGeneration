[Intro]
Ooh
[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran &
Tion Wayne
]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
(
Grr, mm-mm, yeah
)
[Verse 2: Tion Wayne &
Ed Sheeran
]
Feds havin' nightmares when I got my ice
Gyal up on my left side, gyal up on my right (Mm-mm)
Six figure transfer when I cop my ride (Baow, baow, baow)
That's why the opps them just wanna take my life
Before the music, had to put a shift in (Damn)
Made Lambo money from a Citröen
(Boom)
I was tapped then, rolling with my kitchen
That's why they want me just lock up in thе system
Bad habits in my life, in my veins (In my vеins)
Bad habits in the nine with a babe (Boom)
Bad habits, can't end up with a case
Man, them bad vibes just haffi go away
'Cause I was broke, getting Ps weren't easy (Easy)
I'm with Sheeran now, it's cheeky (Mad)
Feds can't believe I'm on TV
They're havin' flashbacks of CCTV
Tough luck (Ooh), he got brucked up (Ooh)
In my drop-top (Ooh), getting top-top (Boom)
And my young buck, if he catch an opp-opp
No Double-E ting, bidda-bop-bop (Boom)
But fuck what you're tellin' 'em (Buh), I'm from Edmonton (Buh)
Bad vibes everyting ****
Rolex or I might bust it on skeleton (Buh, buh, buh)
(
My bad habits lead to you
)
[Verse 3: Central Cee]
I don't wanna go on a mad one
Them say somethin' I can't come back from
Frontways, sideways, cowgirl, backshots
Mr. Miyagi, wax off, wax on
I don't even smoke, she want a backstrap one
Messed up with my good girl and a sad one
Now I'm in a hotel room with a bad one
Strapped up, I don't wanna give mum a grandson
These ladies moving crazy, uh
Wanna have babies by me
Lately I've been keepin' my head down
Ain't been wildin', takin' time out
Cards laid out, got nothin' to hide 'bout
Ayy, maybe I slipped up once on a night out
If she find out 'bout that, she wild out
The sex feel better when you make up
After you break up, all body language
Don't wanna say much
We could go back to the AP and lay up
Or fuck in the back of the
Bentley Bentayga
Come home late, she wake, she stayin' up
Body intact, no personal trainer
Breakfast in bed, don't cook me no bacon
I just want head when I wake up
[Chorus: Tion Wayne &
Central Cee
]
I got gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold
[Verse 4: Tion Wayne &
Central Cee
]
Bad night if we back out the pumpy (Grr)
Bad sight when me keep up the fuckery (Baow)
If I bang him in the face, can't stop me (Mm-mm)
Bad time, but today I'm lucky
Yo, in the rave with the gauge (Baow)
Bad habits, can't end up in a cage (Boom)
Bang at anyone, straight in the face (Baow, baow, mm-mm)
She left me on read back then when I had no bread
Like shorty didn't trust the process
Free all the guys locked down four walls
When I think 'bout that, I get claustrophobic
Pure cocaine, no bakin' soda
Lot of ammonia, I don't condone it
But you gotta do what you gotta do
When you're stuck in the hood just hopin'
I-I-I was lickin' 'em, stickin' them, left as an artist
Dylan just fill up and empty the cartridge
Do it like Sheringham, shoot up the
rahted
Think I won't pull up and bark it (Baow, baow)
When I fly out the M-way, I feel nostalgic
Yay come white like yam, it ain't pounded
Looking for cribs, just fully detached
I came from council housin'
Not in a talk-the-talk, I really walk the walk
Man, this a masterclass, man you can ask the charts
Richard Mille on, you don't know the pass, the password
When it's really on, Wizzy gotta clart it off
No fears 'cah I'm good on the roads where I'm from
You can ask, I'm calm as long as my darg is
Always aim at the target market
Look at the profit margin
[Chorus: Tion Wayne &
Central Cee
]
I got a gyal up in Chelsea, you know
But why everyone there when you blow?
The feds tryna get help with the roads
Me nuh know, me nuh know, me nuh know
I got gyal everywhere in the globe
But everyone disappears when you're broke
If bro calls me and say it's that time, I don't care
I'm putting my career on hold
[Outro: Central Cee &
Tion Wayne
]
Fumez The Engineer
If bro calls me and say it's time, I don't care
I'm putting my ca-, I'm putting my career on hold
But why everyone, but why everyone
But why everyone there when you blow?
