[Verse 1]
Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
[Post-Chorus]
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But, my darlin', I am still in love with you
[Chorus]
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
[Outro]
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you
