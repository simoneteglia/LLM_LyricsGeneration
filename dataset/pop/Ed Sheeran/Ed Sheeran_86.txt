[Verse 1]
My mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart, not a follower, we're not done yet
[Pre-Chorus]
And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'll never let you down
Now, keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
[Chorus]
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, down
[Verse 2]
My eyes are a river filler, this drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen and your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'll never let you down
Now, keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
[Chorus]
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
[Bridge]
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now
And I'll never let you down
[Chorus]
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade eight
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
