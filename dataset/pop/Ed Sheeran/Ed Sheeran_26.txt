[Verse 1]
Give me love like her
'Cause lately, I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
[Pre-Chorus]
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight, I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
[Chorus]
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide-and-seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, give me love
[Verse 2]
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately, I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
[Pre-Chorus]
You know, I'll fight my corner
And that tonight, I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol, mmm
No, I just wanna hold ya
[Chorus]
Give a little time to me or burn this out
Well play hide-and-seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide-and-seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, give me love
[Bridge]

My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
