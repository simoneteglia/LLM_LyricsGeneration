[Intro]
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh,
stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high
[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh,
prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
[Chorus]
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely, I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh,
hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
[Chorus]
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out
[Chorus]
Now, I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (Oh, you know I saw a city burnin' out)
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin)
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
