[Verse 1]
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and, in return, I gave a song
It goes on and on
[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same
And only scars remain
[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Bridge]
But if I don't, then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger, but I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
[Outro]
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself
