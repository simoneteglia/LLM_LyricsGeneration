[Verse 1]
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lipsticks to me
So now, I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishin' I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
[Pre-Chorus]
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold, I'll be freezin'
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evenin'
Take words out of my mouth just from breathin'
Replace with phrases like, "When you leavin' me?"
Should I? Should I?
[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
[Verse 2]
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
We'll see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer, but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
[Chorus]
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
[Bridge]
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
[Chorus]
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
