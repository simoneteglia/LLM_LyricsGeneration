[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinkin' fast, and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body
[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran,
Stormzy
]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
I gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body
[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran &
Stormzy
]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour out my liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
And baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I don't be talking on Twitter, girl, that is dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body
[Outro: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
