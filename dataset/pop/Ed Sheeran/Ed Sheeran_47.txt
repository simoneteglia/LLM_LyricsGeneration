[Verse 1]
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that Heaven is your restin' place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lyin' in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them
[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me, "Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
[Chorus]
Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
[Post-Chorus]
Love, love
[Verse 2]
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now, we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standin' in the rain
And now, my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when
[Pre-Chorus]
My father told me, "Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing
[Chorus]
Darlin', hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
[Post-Chorus]
(Ah-ooh) Love, love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
[Bridge]
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"
(And all my brothers and my sisters, yeah)
And my father and all of my family (Ah)
Rise from their seats to sing "Hallelujah"
[Outro]
(Ah-ooh)
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
(Ah-ooh) See the love, the love, the love, the love
(Ah-ooh, ah-ooh)
