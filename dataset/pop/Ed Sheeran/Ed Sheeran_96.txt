[Intro]
I'm in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low
[Verse 1]
Hit my plug, that's my cholo
He got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco (go crazy)
Hit you with that treinta ocho
If ya thinkin' that I’m solo
A 50 deep, I’m like, “oh, no”
I heard the feds takin' photos
Nothin’, not the popo
[Hook]
I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love, I-I’m in love with the coco
[Verse 2]
30 flicks, that’s a kilo
I need a brick, miss my three flow
I’m in love, just like Nino-no-no
Bustin' shots like Ne-Yo
Free my homies, not the C.O
And not the judge, not my P.O. no
All this sugar, I’m like Nino
Water whip, I’m like Nemo
[Bridge]
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
I whip it through the glass and
We’re going really fast, man
[Hook]
I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love with the coco (love with the coco)
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I’m in love, I-I’m in love with the coco
[Outro]
Low, low, low
Low, low, low
I got it for the low, man
Low, Low, Low
