[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran]
I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me
[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran,
Ella Mai
&
Both
]
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me
[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby
[Refrain: Ella Mai]
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Ella Mai,
Ella Mai
]
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly (
Hey
)
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (
Oh
)
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me (
Babe
)
[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran &
Ella Mai
]
Love, on me, o-o-on me (On me)
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
(
Slow
)
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me (
On me
)
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need
(
Need
)
So put it all on me
[Refrain: Ed Sheeran &
Ella Mai
]
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a
strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
