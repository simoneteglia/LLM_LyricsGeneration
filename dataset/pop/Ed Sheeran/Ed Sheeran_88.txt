[Verse 1]
Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin’ 'bout her
[Refrain]
And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl
[Chorus]
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
’Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my
[Post-Chorus]
Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That’s the way to break my—
[Verse 2]
First love never dies
Guess I’ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember
[Refrain]
Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don’t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl
[Chorus]
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else’s arms?
Well, that's the way to break my
[Post-Chorus]
Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my—
[Outro]
That's the—
That's the—
That's the—
Did I, did I?
That's the—
That's the—
That's the way to break my—
