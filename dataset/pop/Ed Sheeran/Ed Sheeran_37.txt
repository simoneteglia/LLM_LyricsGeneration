[Verse 1]
She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one-way trip
Guess she went wanderin' off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
[Pre-Chorus]
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh, my baby, lately, I know
[Chorus]
That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[Verse 2]
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Roses, roses laid upon your bedspread, oh my
Oh, this, oh, this, I know
[Chorus]
But every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passin' over
Or the thought of growin' old
'Cause from now until I go
[Chorus]
Every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah
Every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holdin' me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
