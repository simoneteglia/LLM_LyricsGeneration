[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul who could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh
[Bridge]
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love
[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
