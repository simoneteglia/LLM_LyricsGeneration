[Verse 1]
"If we take this bird in with its broken leg
We could nurse it," she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh
[Chorus]
But if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
[Verse 2]
If we take a walk out in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little homemade tea
And if you fall asleep, then, at least, you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say, "It's late, love, get back to sleep"
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree with you beside me
[Chorus]
But if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, my little bird, my little bird
[Bridge]
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream and then, I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
[Chorus]
But if I kiss you, will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird, my little bird, my little bird
You're my little bird
