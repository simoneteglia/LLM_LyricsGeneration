[Verse 1]
This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, oh
[Chorus]
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall now
[Verse 2]
You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing
[Chorus]
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall now, woah
[Bridge]
And take me back, take me home
Watch me fall down to Earth
Take me back for
[Outro]
This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new
