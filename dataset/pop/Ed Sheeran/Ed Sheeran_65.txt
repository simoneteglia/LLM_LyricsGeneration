[Verse 1]
It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth
[Pre-Chorus]
Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
[Chorus]
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life
[Verse 2]
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you
[Pre-Chorus]
Why was I feelin' nervous when
Things were goin' so perfect? And
Well, now I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
[Chorus]
And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word, one love, one life
[Outro]
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be
(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be
