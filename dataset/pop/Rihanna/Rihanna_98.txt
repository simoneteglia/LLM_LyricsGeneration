[Verse 1]
Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine
[Pre-Chorus]
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul
[Chorus]
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough
[Verse 2]
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?
[Bridge]
You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now
[Chorus]
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough
