[Intro]
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(What's wrong with me?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(Why do I feel like this?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(I'm goin' crazy now)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
[Verse 1]
No more gas, in the red (Can't even get it started)
Nothin' heard, nothin' said (Can't even speak about it)
All my life on my head (Don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm goin' insane, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Ah)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Ah)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Ah)
It's too close for comfort, ah
[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
[Post-Chorus]
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scarin' you tonight?
Your mind's in disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia
[Refrain]
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
[Verse 2]
Faded pictures on the wall (It's like they talkin' to me)
Disconnected, no one calls (The phone don't even ring)
I gotta get out or figure this **** out
It's too close for comfort, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Ooh)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Ooh)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Ooh)
I feel like a monster, oh
[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder (City lights)
Ain't gon' play nice (Oh)
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice (Think twice)
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise (Be wise)
[Post-Chorus]
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scarin' you tonight? (Oh)
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like (Oh, what you like)
Disturbia, disturbia (Ah)
[Refrain]
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Ba-da-da-da-de-da)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Ba-da-da-da-de-da)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Disturbia)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Oh, oh)
[Bridge]
Release me from this curse I'm in
Tryin' to remain tame, but I'm strugglin'
If you can't go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think I'm gonna ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder (Woo, yeah)
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under (Better think twice)
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise (If you must falter, be wise)
[Post-Chorus]
Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is the light (Ah, yeah, disturbia)
Disturbia, am I scarin' you tonight? (Ah, yeah, disturbia)
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like (Disturbia, ah)
Disturbia, disturbia (Oh woah)
[Refrain]
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Bum-ba-de-da-da)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Bum-ba-de-da-da)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Oh)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Oh)
