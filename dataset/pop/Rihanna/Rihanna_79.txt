[Refrain: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe
If you want to, let him go
Ladies, don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Men be fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?
[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya"?
You got me mistaken thinking you gon' get it easy
First of all, you need to know that I'm not the one
Think you gettin' somethin', baby, you ain't gettin' none
All you need to know that I'm a two times five
Load it, cock it, aim it, baby, boom bye-bye
Set your standards lower, boy, you're aimin' too high
Matter of fact, your friend looks better, so goodbye
[Refrain: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe
If you want to, let him go
Ladies, don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Men be fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?
[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Excuse me, but who are you fixin' to be?
Let them motherfuckers know there's plenty fish in the sea
And he sweatin' me just 'cause I got the tightest hole
But I couldn't find that-that thing with a microscope (Oh)
Give me dome, dome, da-da-da-da-da-dome, dome, dome
I ain't trippin' on your money, money, long, long, long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me, Celie
Anyway, RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you wanna sit on the back while I wheelie?
Really? Really? No, for real, really?
Laid out on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes
'Cause it's raining men, fat bitches
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Men be fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?
[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah, woah
[Verse 3: Rihanna]
I said ayy, outta my way, where my ladies?
Ridin' big, living good, doin' big things
Dancin' don't pay
Player, keep the money, I can buy my own drink
Up in the club (Ayy)
See men coming, dime a dozen
So it don't mean nothin' to me (Ayy)
And I ain't even worried about you, homie
'Cause thereâ€™s plenty more fish in the sea (Okay)
[Refrain: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe
If you want to, let him go
Ladies, don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Men be fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Fallin' like the rain, so we ain't runnin' out
Oh, it's rainin' men, girl, what you worried 'bout?
[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh woah, woah, woah
