[Verse 1]
911, it's a critical emergency, yeah
Better run-run-run
Come and charge him with the 1-4-3, yeah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now it's done, done, done
And his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?
[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Fi-Fo-Fum, like the sky is falling down on me
Numb-numb-numb
He so cold, he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Go on and put him away
He's the only one-one-one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he waved me goodbye
He say he care, but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga, is you blind?
[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Bridge]
Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no 'cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
No love, no love, no love allowed
[Chorus]
Like a bullet, your love hit me to the core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us?
I call it murder, no love allowed
