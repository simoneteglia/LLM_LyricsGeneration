[Intro]
Ooh
Oh
[Verse 1]
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now
[Break]
Ooh
Oh
[Verse 2]
A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend
[Chorus]
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?
[Verse 3]
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now
[Break]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
[Chorus]
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?
