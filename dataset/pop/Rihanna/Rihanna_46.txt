[Verse 1]
Te amo
, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over
[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
[Verse 2]
Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over
[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
[Bridge]
Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
Iâ€™m moving through the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way
[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
[Outro]
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you?
