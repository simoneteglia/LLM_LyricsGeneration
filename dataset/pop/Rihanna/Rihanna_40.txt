[Verse 1]
I'd rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe
Every time you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me
[Hook]
Don't know why, just know I want to
Don't know why, just know I want you
[Verse 2]
I'd rather be breaking things, cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes
,
here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like "fuck rules"?
Don't care why, just know I love you
