[Verse 1: Rihanna,

They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this (
Young!
)
Tougher than a lion
, ain't gon' needa try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this (
Young!
)
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades (
Shades
)
Blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion
As in, going 'til they say stop (
Hold up
)
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (
Here
)
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know
[Chorus: Rihanna,
Jeezy

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (

[Verse 2: Rihanna,
Jeezy
]
All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony (
Young!
)
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top getting lonely (
Young!
)
Who think they test me now?
Run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from twenty-seven million (
Young!
)
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that, hope that ain't all you got
I need it all
(
Hold up!
)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know
[Chorus: Rihanna,
Jeezy
]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (
So hard
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (
Too hard
)
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (
So hard
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (
Too hard
)
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (
So hard

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (
Too hard
)
So hard (
Yeah!

Yeah!
)
So hard (
Yeah!
) so hard (
Yeah!

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
It's go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "Give me back my swag," they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest,
Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to 'em
[Bridge: Rihanna,
Jeezy
]
Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
So hard (
Yeah!
) so hard (
Yeah!
)
So hard (
Yeah!
) so hard (
Yeah!
)
[Chorus: Rihanna,
Jeezy
]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (
Yeah!
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (
Yeah!
)
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (
So hard
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (
Too hard
)
So hard, so hard (
So hard
)
So hard, so hard (
Too hard
)
[Outro: Rihanna]
That I, I, I
