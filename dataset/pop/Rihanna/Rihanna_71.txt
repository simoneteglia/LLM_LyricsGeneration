[Intro: Rihanna &
Ne-Yo
]
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, huh
That's how much I love you (
Yeah
; No, whoa, whoa, huh)
That's how much I need you (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
[Verse 1: Rihanna &
Ne-Yo
,
Both
]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile (
Uh
)
Can I not like you for a while? (
No
)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden, I forget
(
That I was upset
)
I can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
[Chorus: Rihanna &
Ne-Yo
]
And I hate how much I love you, boy (
Yeah
)
I can't stand how much I need you (
I need you
)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (
Yeah, ooh whoa
)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
[Verse 2: Ne-Yo &
Rihanna
,
Both
]
Ooh, and you completely know the power that you have (
The power that you have
)
The only one that makes me laugh (
One that makes me laugh
)
Said that it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
(
I
)
Love you beyond the reason why
(
Why
)
And it just ain't right
, oh
[Chorus: Ne-Yo &
Rihanna
]
And I hate how much I love you, girl (Hey)
I can't stand how much I need you (
Hey, hey
)
And I hate how much I love you, girl (
No
)
But I just can't let you go (Ooh)
But I hate that I love you so
[Bridge: Rihanna &
Ne-Yo
,
Both
]
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (
Hmm
)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one
in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah...
Ooh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Rihanna &
Ne-Yo
,
Both
]
That's how much I love you (
How much I need you
)
That's how much I need you (
How much I love you
)
That's how much I love you (
Oh, I need you
)
That's how much I need you (
I need you
)
And I hate that I love you
so
And I hate how much I love you, boy (
Hey!
)
I can't stand how much I need you (
Can't stand how much I need you
)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (
Girl
)
But I just can't let you go (
But I just can't let you go, no
)
But I hate that I love you so (
Ooh
)
And I
hate that I love you so
, so
