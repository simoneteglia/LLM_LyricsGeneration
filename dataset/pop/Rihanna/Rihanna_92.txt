[Verse 1]
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame
[Pre-Chorus]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar
[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar (Rockstar)
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar (Rockstar)
Hey baby

[Verse 2]
Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?
[Pre-Chorus]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar
[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar (Rockstar)

Hey

'Cause I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I'ma live my whole life in the night
'Cause I ain't got time to borrow
