[Intro]
My way
Body
My way

[Chorus]
Can I tell you that I’m wanting you?
I’m in love with the way you move
And I think you should have a drink or two
Truth is I wanna lie with you, so come my way (My way)
Feel like you need somebody (Body)
So baby girl come my way (My way)
Feel like you need somebody (Body)
[Verse 1]
Dip low, watching her dip low
Dances on me and now she sip slow
Watching you head down to your tip toe
You know I got something for when we get home
Get home, now you’re in my zone, in my zone
And we gon’ get going
Wood in your frame, it's like window
Tear off your garments, we can bin those
[Pre-Chorus]
I said gimme your love, you know you're bad like Rihanna (Ayy)
I’ll do you good no wahala (Ayy)
But I can’t promise forever, oh nah nah nah

But I can’t promise forever, oh nah
