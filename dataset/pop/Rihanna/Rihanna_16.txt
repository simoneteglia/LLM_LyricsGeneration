[Intro: Future]
Ain't nothin' wrong with it
[Chorus: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affection
[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning, save me
Give it to me on a daily
If I'm your girl, say my name, boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
(I-I-I) Won't play around
(I-I-I) Wanna lay you down
(I-I-I) I need you now
I need you now, oh
[Chorus: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affection
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering
I'm wondering, If I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
(I-I-I) Don't put it down
(I-I-I) Don't fuck around
(I-I-I) I want you now
I want you now, oh
[Chorus: Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affection
[Bridge: Future
with Rihanna
]
Can you love me for poor? (Let me know)
I'm searching for my soul (Rockstar)
Who ever turned you cold? (Because)
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical (Physical)
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart
Beating through my clothes
Future
[Chorus: Rihanna & Future]
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affection
