[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear
[Chorus: Rihanna &
Kanye West
]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash
)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash
)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Can't you see?
Ain't it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare
[Chorus: Rihanna &
Kanye West
]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash
)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash
)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going
[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (no!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motionin' you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'causeâ€”
[Chorus: Rihanna &
Kanye West
]
'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash
)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
(
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash
)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going
