[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No
[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love
I want it, I crave it
I just can't get enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
[Chorus 1]
You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
I've been let down
But never been tainted
So I'll stay thirsty for more
No, I won't hold back
No drop is wasted
I'll let love run its course
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
[Chorus 2]
You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
[Bridge]
I'm so intoxicated
I love the way you taste on my lips, when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much, I can't resist falling into your arms
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
[Chorus 2]
You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
[Outro]
It's all that I need
It's all that I need
