[Verse 1]
There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
We could all fall down
Before our savior could return
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
[Chorus]
If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling, cover me, please
[Verse 2]
The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forever more
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
[Chorus]
If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling cover me, please
[Outro]
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
