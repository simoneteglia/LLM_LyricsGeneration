Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised (
Nah

Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised (
Hey

Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain (
Certain

Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it
[Verse 1: Rihanna and
Future
]
Shoppin' in Paris (
Yeah

We gon' go shoppin' in Paris, nigga (
We goin', we goin'

They can't even compare us (
No

They can't even compare us, we're rarer than niggas
Rarer than niggas
I never'd 'magine this shit comin' (
I never imagined
)
This shit comin'
We swimmin' in money, we drownin' in hundreds (
Yeah, yeah

Ayy, I keep a duffle bag on me like Tity Boi and Dolla (
Duffle bag, duffle bag
)
Bruh, we ain't takin' that weed, oh no (
Roll it, roll it
)
And if they don't love me, fuck whatcha talkin' 'bout
I'm in love with the cash, I put that on my mama and father
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it
[Verse 2: Rihanna and
Future

Goin' to France (
Yeah

We gon' vacation in France, nigga (
Yeah

Advanced niggas, can't nobody stop me, I'm past niggas (
Turn up
)
I'm past my limit
I'm drunk and I'm blowin' a whole lot of gas, nigga (
Yeah
)
Ten million in cash (
Cash
)
Put up in a stash, it's under my mattress (
Yeah, yeah
)
Ayy, I put the money in the ground like my nigga Frank Lukas (
Frank Lucas
)
Got a turbo Porsche, and I don't even move it (
Skrrt
)
I'm back on the green, it's so hard not to use it (
Yeah
)
I'm continuously winnin', my nigga, I can't see me losin'
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it
[Post-Chorus: Rihanna and
Future
]
Ain't none of this promised (
Nope
)
Ain't none of this promised (
No, no
)
Ain't nothin' in life guaranteed
Put that on my mama (
I put that on my mama
)
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (
None of this
)
Ain't none of it promised (
Hey
)
Ain't none of this certain, not even one of us perfect (
Yeah
)
[Bridge: Rihanna and
Future

Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (

Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this (
None of this

Ain't none of this promised (
