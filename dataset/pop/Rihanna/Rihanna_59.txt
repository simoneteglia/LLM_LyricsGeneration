[Intro]
Bangladesh
[Chorus]
Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then
swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around
[Verse 1]
I want you to be my sex slave (Anything that I desire)
Be one with my feminine
(Set my whole body on fire)
They mad at Rihanna game
(Taking over your empire)
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts
[Pre-Chorus]
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (
You
)
[Chorus]
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then
swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around
[Verse 2]
I can be your dominatrix (Just submit to my every order)
Enter my diamond matrix
(Devour my golden flower)
Make me your priority (Place nothing above my pleasure)
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts
[Pre-Chorus]
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (
You
)
[Chorus]
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
[Verse 3]
Hold me down, beat it like a bully
Beat my drum, drum, like a drumline boogie (I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body, hold me tight Mr. Lover (I love it when you)
Do it like I, do it like I say
Keep it up, boy, we can do this all day
Be my Harlem
and me Saint-Tropez
Never found nobody that will do it this way
[Pre-Chorus]
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (
You
)
[Chorus]
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
