[Verse 1]
And you got me like, oh
What you want from me? (
What you want from me?
)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like, oh, mmm
You love when I fall apart (
Fall apart
)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you got me like, I, woo, I
Don't you stop loving me (
Loving me
)
Don't quit loving me (
Loving me
)
Just start loving me, oh (
Loving me
)
[Chorus]
And, babe, I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'll run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (
Feeling this way
)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (
Cursing my name
)
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain
[Verse 2]
Baby, keep loving me
Just love me, yeah
Just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ow
I'm tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin' heart?
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, like, I, woo I
Don't you stop loving me (
Loving me
)
Don't quit loving me (
Loving me
)
Just start loving me, ooh (
Loving me
)
[Chorus]
And, babe, I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'll run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (
Feeling this way
)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (
Cursing my name
)
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain
