[Chorus]
Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound
[Verse 1]
Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me in the warmth of your love
When you depart, keep me safe
Safe and sound
[Chorus]
Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me close
Safe and sound
[Verse 2]
Drowning in an endless sea
Take some time and stay with me
Keep me in the strength of your arms
Keep me safe
Safe and sound
[Chorus]
Lift me up
Hold me down
Keep me safe
Safe and sound
[Verse 3]
Burning in a hopeless dream
Hold me when you go to sleep
Keep me safe
We need light, we need love
[Chorus]
(Lift me up) Lift me up in your arms
(Hold me down) I need love, I need love, I need love
(Keep me close) Hold me, hold me
(Safe and sound) Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
(Lift me up) Hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
(Hold me down) Hold me, hold me
(Keep me safe) We need light, we need love
