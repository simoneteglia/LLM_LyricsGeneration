[Chorus]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
[Verse 1]
Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I'd never know
(Ooh)
Shadows chased me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold
(Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
And you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul
[Chorus]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
[Verse 2]
Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust
(Ooh-ooh)
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays
(Ooh-ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul
[Chorus]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
[Bridge]
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna run to, when you get to the edge of the night?
Its time you face the sky, ooh
[Breakdown]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
[Chorus]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
[Outro]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
