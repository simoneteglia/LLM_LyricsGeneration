[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise
[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap)
[Verse 2]
How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken-hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
(With this heart, with this heart)
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise
[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap, bass slap)
[Bridge]
It may be wrong, but it feels right
All my fears are gone tonight
I'm lost in paradise
[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
Yeah
Lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
(Bass slap)
