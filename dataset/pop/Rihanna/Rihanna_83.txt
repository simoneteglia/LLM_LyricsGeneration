[Verse 1]
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone, and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Patron on the brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
[Verse 2]
He's stayin' with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks callin' the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
He finds a letter on the stairs, sayin', "This is the end"
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh
[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
[Bridge]
Mmh
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone, and left us all alone, no-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We done forever
[Outro]
We gone forever
We gone forever
