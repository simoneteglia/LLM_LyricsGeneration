[Verse 1]
The mood is set (Huh, huh)
So you already know what's next (Uh-huh, ah)
TV on blast, turn it down, turn it down
Don't want it to clash
With my body screaming out, no (No-oh)
I know you hearin' it (Oh-oh)
You got me moanin' now
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh
I got a secret, so I'ma drop 'em to the floor, oh
[Refrain]
And no teasin', you waited long enough
Go deep, I'ma throw it at you, can you catch it?
Don't hold back, you know I like it rough
Know I'm feelin' you, huh
Know you're likin' it, huh
So why you standin' over there with your clothes on?
Baby, strip down for me, go on, take 'em off
Don't worry, baby, I'ma meet you halfway
'Cause I know you wanna see me
[Verse 2]
Almost there (Huh, huh)
So, baby, don't stop what you're doing (Uh-huh, ah)
Softer than a mother, boy, I know you wanna touch
Breathing down my neck, I can tell you wanna (No-oh)
And now you want it like (Oh-oh)
Want you to feel it now
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh
I got a secret, so I'ma drop 'em to the floor, oh
[Refrain]
And no teasin', you waited long enough
Go deep, I'ma throw it at you, can you catch it?
Don't hold back, you know I like it rough
Know I'm feelin' you, huh
Know you're likin' it, huh
So why you standin' over there with your clothes on?
Baby, strip down for me, go on, take 'em off
Don't worry, baby, I'ma meet you halfway
'Cause I know you wanna see me
[Chorus]
No heels, no shirt, no skirt, all I'm in is just skin
No jeans, take 'em off, wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh, you know that I like that skin
Come here, baby, all I wanna see you in is just skin (Oh woah)
Oh, oh, your skin (Oh woah)
Oh, oh, just skin (Oh woah)
Oh, oh, I'm lovin' your skin
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
All in, baby, don't hold nothing back (Oh woah)
Wanna take control, ain't nothing wrong with that (Oh woah)
Say you're likin' how I'm feelin', gotta tell me that
Just put your skin, baby, on my skin
[Chorus]
No heels, no shirt, no skirt, all I'm in is just skin
No jeans, take 'em off, wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh, you know that I like that skin (You know that I like it, baby)
Come here, baby, all I wanna see you in is just skin
Oh, oh, your skin
Oh, oh, just skin (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, I'm lovin' your skin
Oh, oh (All I wanna see you in is just)
[Outro]
No heels, no shirt, no skirt, all I'm in is just skin
No jeans, take 'em off, wanna feel your skin
You a beast, oh, you know that I like that skin
Come here, baby, all I wanna see you in is just skin
All I wanna see you in is just skin (Oh, oh, your skin)
All I wanna see you in is just skin, oh (Oh, oh, just skin)
All I wanna see you in (Oh, oh, I'm lovin' your skin)
All I wanna see you in is your skin, oh (Oh, oh)
