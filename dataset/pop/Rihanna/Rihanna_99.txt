[Intro]
Ow-ow (Ow-ow)
Ow-ow (Ow-ow)
Ow-ow (Ow-ow-ow)
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
(Am am am am am am am am, ow)
[Verse 1]
He been gone (Gone) since 3:30 (3:30)
Been coming home lately at 3:30 (3:30)
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot, and baby, you gon' get it
Now I ain't trippin', ah, I ain't twisted, ah
I ain't demented, ha, well, just a lil' bit (Ha)
I'm kickin' asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame, don't come home, babe
[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, oh
[Verse 2]
I'm still waitin', come through the door
I'm killin' time, you know, bleachin' your clothes
I'm roastin' marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burnin' is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheatin'? Man, I don't know
I'm lookin' 'round for something else to throw
[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, oh
[Bridge]
(Ah) I don't know who you think I am (I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I don't know who you think I am)
But I really don't give a damn right now (Ah)
If you don't come, I'ma huff and puff and blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this house, house down
Dishes, breakin' dishes, breakin' dishes
[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights (Uh-huh)
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
Fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man, oh
[Outro]
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin' (Dishes, dishes, dishes)
