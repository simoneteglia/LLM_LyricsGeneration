[Verse 1]
Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
I don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know It'll be sadder
If you never hit the road
[Chorus]
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me
[Verse 2]
I will write to tell you what's goin' on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day
Telling you stories about a land far away
But I know
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road
[Chorus]
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me
[Bridge]
And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'ma try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be the reason you don't leave
[Chorus]
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me
