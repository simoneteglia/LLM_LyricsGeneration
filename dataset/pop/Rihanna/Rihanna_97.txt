[Intro]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
[Bridge]
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
[Verse 1]
I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up
[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over
[Refrain]
It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn
[Verse 2]
So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up
[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over
[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
[Verse 3]
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe, you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over
[Bridge]
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
[Chorus]
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over
[Refrain]
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
[Outro]
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
