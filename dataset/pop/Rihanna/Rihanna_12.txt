[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I come flutterin' in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you tried to
I come ridin' in on a pale white horse
Handin' out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you're breakin' it down for me
'Cause I can't hear you
Two times, run it on back
Will it ever make sense to me?
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things my own way, darlin'
Will you ever let me?
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind, oh
[Verse 2: Rihanna,
Both
]
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it's seein' now
Ooh, darlin', would you mind givin' my reflection a break
From the pain it's
feelin' now
?
[Chorus: SZA,
Both
]
I got to do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
[Post-Chorus: SZA,
Both
]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I
look outside my window
I can't get no peace
of mind,
oh
[Outro: SZA,
Rihanna
]
Get no peace
Get no peace
Get, get, gettin' no peace, oh
Get no peace
Get, g-get no peace, oh
