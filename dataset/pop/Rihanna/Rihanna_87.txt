[Refrain]
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I get you
Sometimes, I don't understand
Sometimes, I love you
Sometimes, it's you I can't stand
Sometimes, I wanna hug you
Sometimes, I wanna push you away
Most times, I wanna kiss you
Other times, punch you in the face
'Cause every minute, you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you, take my heart from you
And you come running after me, and baby, I'm back with you, oh
[Refrain]
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I catch you
Sometimes, you get away
Sometimes, I read you
Other times, I'm like, "Where are you on the page?"
Sometimes, I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated, my heart knows better
[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
[Bridge]
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone
[Chorus]
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
[Refrain]
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
