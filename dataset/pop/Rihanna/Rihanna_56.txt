[Chorus: Rihanna]
You'll always be mine
Sing it to the world
Always be my boy
I'll always be your girl
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
Mine and my baby
But mine and my baby
But mine and my baby (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I love to, love to, love you, baby
I love to, love to, love you, baby (Woo, woo)
Me and you, get it? (Woo, woo)
Ain't nobody's business
Said, it ain't nobody's business (Woo, woo)
[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Your love is perfection
Please point me in the right direction
I'ma give you all my affection
Every touch becomes infectious
Let's make out in this Lexus
There's no other love just like this
A life with you
I wonder, can we become love's persona?
[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
You'll always be the one that I wanna come home to, boy
Let me love you and show you how special you are
I wanna be your baby, you'll always be my baby
Tell me what you want now
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Let's sing it to the world
Baby, give me time
I'ma be your girl
I wanna make you mine
And it ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
It ain't nobody's business
Just mine and my baby
[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh (Ooh-ooh)
Oh (Ooh-ooh)
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Your love is perfection
Please point me in the right direction
