[Intro: Kevin Cossom]
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump
[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Tell me that you love me, when you know you don't love me
But I guess, I guess, I guess it's all good
You can play the game, I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls
I bet they be wondering why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around, I ain't got all day
[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know
[Chorus: Rihanna]
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
[Drop: Kevin Cossom]
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Think I give a damn
Boy, don't you know who I am?
I ain't running 'round chasing no dude
Think somebody else like me gone come around?
Boy, you got it misunderstood
Put it in your face, but you actin' all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance,
tell me, what it's gon' be?
[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered
Let the others know
[Chorus: Rihanna]
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
[Drop: Rihanna]
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
[Bridge: Kevin Cossom]
You say it's my fault
Okay, I get it
You ain't pick up your calls
I'm like, "forget it"
See you put up your wall
You know you did it
The rise and the fall
Just admit it
You say it's my fault
Okay, I get it
You ain't answer your calls
I'm like, "forget it"
It's the the rise and the fall
It's the the rise and the fall
And you could have had it all
[Chorus: Rihanna]
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
If you want it, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle is waiting
Come and jump on it
[Drop: Rihanna]
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump on it)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump on it)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump on it)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump on it)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump, jump on it)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump, jump on it)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump, jump on it)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Jump, jump on it)
