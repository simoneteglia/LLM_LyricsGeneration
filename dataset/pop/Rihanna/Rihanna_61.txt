[Verse 1]
It's dark in the day
I'll say now don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
You're so afraid to cry
But your heart be feeling dry
It's time to change
But you keep thunderin', thunderin'
I'm wonderin', wonderin' why you keep thunderin'
Won't you just rain?
And get it over with
[Verse 2]
When I feel the pain
Now, babe, I won't complain
I hear you say, "Look up, the sun is just a cloud away"
And now we're so afraid to cry
When you need a wave to ride, that's the way
You keep thunderin', thunderin'
I'm wonderin', wonderin' why you keep thunderin'
Won't you just fucking rain?
And get it over with
[Chorus]
And get it over with
I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again
I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again
It's alright
We can roll In the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
It's alright
We can roll in the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
It's alright
We can roll on the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
[Verse 3]
Keep thunderin', thunderin'
I'm wonderin', wonderin' why you keep thunderin'
Won't you fucking just rain?
And get it over with
[Chorus]
And get it over with
I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again
I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again

We can roll In the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
It's alright
We can roll in the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
It's alright
We can roll on the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
We should be lighting it up
We should be lighting it up
Started with a lighting
It's dark in the day now
Say now don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
