[Intro]
Sak pas√©!
[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
[Verse 2]
It's a twenty-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down (Would you hear me now?)
In Central Station
[Bridge]
Look, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, oh gosh
Whatever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon?
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull it pon' you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Eh
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Mi say wah man down
A weh mi say
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
When mi went downtown
'Cause now I am criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord, oh mercy, now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run outta town, none a dem can see mi now, see mi now
[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
