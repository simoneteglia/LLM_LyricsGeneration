[Verse 1]
Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?
[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
[Verse 2]
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?
[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
[Guitar Solo]
My California king
[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
