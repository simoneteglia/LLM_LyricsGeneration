[Intro: Rihanna]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Interlude: Rihanna]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2: Rihanna
& Chris Martin
]
Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
Now why'd you have to go
Have to go and throw water on my flame?
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
[Post-Chorus: Chris Martin & Rihanna]
You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
[Bridge: Rihanna]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Outro: Chris Martin & Rihanna]
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh, you really hurt me, oh
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh, you really hurt me
