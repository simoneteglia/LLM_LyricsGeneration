[Intro: Rihanna]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Talk that talk to me, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, I be tryna chill, bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, "Fuck me!"
Shawty must've heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by her bladder, she like, “Oh, I gotta pee!” Hahaha
Ran into a Rothko in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
Gotta have a ticket for a walk through
Everything I do is Big ("Who y'all talkin to?")
I talk big money,
I talk big homes
I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I’m flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach
, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up
What’s up
[Chorus: Rihanna]
One and two and a three and four
Come on, let me know if you want some more
You know what I like, now get it right
Boy, talk that talk to me all night
Yeah boy, I like it, yeah boy, I like it
Love it when you talk that talk to me, yeah
Yeah, that talk to me, yeah
Love it when you talk that talk to me, yeah
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Say what you want, say what you like
Say you want me to do and I got you
Tell me how to love you, tell me how to hold you

'Cause you ain’t never had a woman like me, yeah
And you will never have another like me, yeah
No, so I’mma give it to you, baby
