[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, whoa
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
[Post-Chorus]
American oxygen, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
[Verse 1]
Oh, say can you see
This is the American Dream
Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all
In America, America (America, America)
I say if you can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe
[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
[Post-Chorus]
American oxygen, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
[Verse 2]
Oh, say can you see
This is the American Dream
Young boy, hustlin'
Tryna get the wheels in motion
But he can be anything at all
In America, America (America, America)
I say if you can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe
[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
[Bridge]
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
[Chorus]
Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, woah
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
[Post-Chorus]
American oxygen, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen, woah
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen
[Outro]
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
