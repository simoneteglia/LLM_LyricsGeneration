Remember how you did it?

If you still wanna kiss it
Come, come-come and get it
Sweeter than a rice cake
Cake worth sippin'
Kill it, tip it, cake, fill it
If you sexy and you know it
And you ain't afraid to show it
Put a candle on my ma'fuckin' back
Baby, blow it
Love the way you do it when you do it like that
Show up with them stacks
Rainin' racks on my rack
Wrap it up, wrap it up
Boy, while I take this bow off
Talk that talk
Yeah, I know I'm such a show-off
Daddy, make a wish
Put this cake in your face
Hahaha, and it's not even my birthday
Ow! (
Get it
