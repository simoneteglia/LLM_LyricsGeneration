[Intro: Rihanna]
I see you walk
You know that I need you
I hear you, boy
You know that I
I see you walk
[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Love it, then come and get it
I know that ya fuckin' with it
Ya see me, ya like it, huh?
Heels Givenchy, huh?
Love it, then play it back
Plus where the forty at?
I'm fucking ya cheap trill
On top of my fifty mill
We eating the cake killa
Own it, but don't kill her
My jewelers are diamond rollers
My rock, chinchilla
Some more for the fun
I'm rolling like rockstars
I got fifty muthafuckers in my watch
With my bandz out
[Chorus: The-Dream]
Phresh out the runway
Phresh out, phresh out the runway
Phresh, phresh out the runway

Venus, I'm out at coast
My bitches don't know
Fuck with her
My designer drip to the fucking flo'
Be out in that
They like 'em in all them honey stuffs
Monas are rolling loudies
And my bitches so Bulgari
Bodies of Ducatis
Do what the fuck you want
I bet you niggas gon' be like
"Bitch, this my fucking song"
How could you be so hood?
But you so fucking pop?
How could you be so fun
And sound like you selling rocks?
What's in the ching dollars?
What's in my chain dollars?
All of the bank dollars
Got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars
I was in the back line
I'm standing in the bank line
You throwing up the gang sign

Rihanna
